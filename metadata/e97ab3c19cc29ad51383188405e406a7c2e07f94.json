This is a book on chemistry, albeit one easily accessible to lay people. Pollack is a highly decorated professor at the University of Washington, author of numerous peer-reviewed papers, recipient of the 2012 Prigogine Medal, and editor of the academic journal Water. I mention this because in a field fraught with what some call pseudo-science, but what Iâ€™ll politely call speculative inquiry unburdened by scientific rigor, paradigm-busting theories attract an inordinate degree of hostility","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e97ab3c19cc29ad51383188405e406a7c2e07f94","amp;dn":"The+Fourth+Phase+of+Water%3A+Beyond+Solid%2C+Liquid%2C+and+Vapor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e97ab3c19cc29ad51383188405e406a7c2e07f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,122,179,193,156,194,154,213,19,131,24,132,5,228,6,167,194,224,127,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
