The songs span an enormous spectrum of experience, from the frontline of social unrest to the secluded, birdsong-infested lanes of the English countryside. Stormcock resolutely and uncompromisingly creates its own world. \n\nThe album features Led ZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jimmy Page on guitar. It also showcases David Bedford's orchestral arrangements.\n\nThe album's title, Stormcock, is an old English name for the Mistle Thrush. The male of this species &quot;is most vocal in the early morning&quot; and has a &quot;tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather&quot; which &quot;led to the old name &quot;StormcockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It is also, perhaps, a metaphor for Harper himself.\n\nBy the time Stormcock was released, Harper was a counterculture icon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ name-checked by Led Zeppelin on III in the song Hats Off to (Roy) Harper.\n\nNME placed Stormcock at 377 in their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time&quot;. \n\n\n\nRoy Harper\n\nStormcock\n\n1971\n\n2007 Remaster\n\n \n\nCD / 2007 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTrackslist:\n\n1.
