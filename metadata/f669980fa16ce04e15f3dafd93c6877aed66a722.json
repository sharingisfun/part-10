And while you might not think so when you look at your own cat slumped in front of the fire, they still share some fascinating character traits with their bigger wild cousins. From agility to territory marking to hunting, it's surprising how much our cats have retained. What's equally surprising is how some people relate to our bigger feline friends. Take Kevin Richardson, who looks after rescue lions in South Africa. &quot;They're super-friendly, super-nice,&quot; he says, cheerfully, as he's promptly wrestled to the ground by a hulking great lioness. But all the time he's watching their every move, and he's got some handy hints for gauging your own cat's state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  Super Cats \r\nCats are said to hate water, crave warmth and only eat meat. But in episode three, Super Cats, viewers are introduced to the wild cats that break all the feline rules. From jaguars with sub-aqua skills to tigers that can survive temperatures of minus forty, the programme reveals how cats have developed super powers to survive in the most unlikely landscapes. As well as the iconic big cats, in this final episode viewers get a glimpse into the lives of the most rare and strange cats of all - including a real-life Garfield recently discovered living high in the Himalayas. It's revealed how the cats' ability to adapt to extremes has made them some of the most successful predators on the planet.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d9/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3143 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f669980fa16ce04e15f3dafd93c6877aed66a722","amp;dn":"ITV+The+Story+Of+Cats+Series+1+3of3+Super+Cats+720p+x264+AAC+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f669980fa16ce04e15f3dafd93c6877aed66a722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,105,152,15,161,108,224,78,21,243,218,253,147,198,135,122,237,102,167,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
