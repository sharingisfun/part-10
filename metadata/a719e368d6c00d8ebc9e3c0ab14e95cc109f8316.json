Self-reflexive by nature, this fictional film about a documentary filmmaker is commonly referred to as a watershed in KieslowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transition from documentary to fiction filmmaking. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m frightened of real tears,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kieslowski once said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In fact, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know if I have the right to photograph them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis ethical question becomes the epicenter of the life of Filip Mosz (Jerzy Stuhr Ã¢â‚¬â€œ KieslowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Three Colors: White), the main character in Camera Buff. Happily married and economically stable, the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humble hero buys an 8mm film camera with the intention of filming his newborn childÃ¢â‚¬â€and capturing the moment of attainment of a lifelong dream. But when a powerhouse director of the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s local factory recruits him to film an important board meeting, Filip's fascination with the medium grows into passionate dedication. At the command of a larger film unit and networking to enrich his career, Filip eventually reaches an irreconcilable deadlock with his wife, friends and the director who previously supported his cinematic ambitions.\n\nCamera Buff mirrors KieslowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complex relationship with Ã¢â‚¬Å“realityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and its possible representations. Through FilipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often comic need to capture Ã¢â‚¬Å“life as it is,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kieslowski denounces the myth of objectivity at the base of cinÃƒÂ©ma vÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ©. More than implying that there is no engagement with reality that can leave it untouched, Kieslowski suggests that the very act of seeing is in itself a moment of creation.\n\nDVD Extras:\n* Interview with Filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi\n* Interview with Filmmaker Agnieszka Holland\n* Interview with Kieslowski Scholar Annette Insdorf\n* Ã¢â‚¬Å“Talking HeadsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (B&amp;W, 1980, 16 min) - A short documentary by Kieslowski in Polish with English subtitles\n* Kieslowski Filmography\n* Theatrical Trailer\n* A Kieslowski Trailer Gallery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a719e368d6c00d8ebc9e3c0ab14e95cc109f8316","amp;dn":"Kieslowski+-+Camera+Buff+aka+Amator+%28Art+Movie+1979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a719e368d6c00d8ebc9e3c0ab14e95cc109f8316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,25,227,104,214,192,13,142,188,158,60,10,177,78,149,204,16,159,131,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
