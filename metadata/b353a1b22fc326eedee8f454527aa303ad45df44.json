This will only play on your iPod and not your PSP or your Zune.\n\n* Hilarious movie actually, great to see Jack Nicholson do some non-serious roles.\n\n* The only movie Adam Sandler that actually made me laugh, other than Happy Gilmore.\n\nPlease enjoy and seed. If you want more, now that 3xO is gone.
