At this stage, good nutrition has an impact not only on their daily well-being but also on their growth and future health. While in developing countries, enabling children to get enough food s the main problem, here in the Western countries, the whole matter is getting children to eat good food. All too often children and young people make less prudent choices with over consumption of fat and sugar and too little fruit and vegetables. Recently, I was asked to judge a Food In Schools competition for those attending secondary schools. The ompetition was held at the East of England Show in Peterborough. The schools had been through a number of stages before the final dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ncompetition. The standard was extremely high and it was excellent to see young people involved in enjoying cooking as well as doing it to such a high standard. Also I was delighted to be asked to judge a competition called Care Cook of the Year on behalf of the National ssociation of Care Caterers. This was open to cooks whoare involved in preparing food for those they care for in residential care homes and\nday centres. Most of the entrants to the competition were cooking for elderly. Real attention to the food and suitability of it for the group catered for had been made. Again the standard was extremely high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10fa064472360f6983cd3b8f3310c6aff5dbcd4c","amp;dn":"Nutrition+%26+Food+Science%3A+Children+and+young+people","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10fa064472360f6983cd3b8f3310c6aff5dbcd4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,250,6,68,114,54,15,105,131,205,59,143,51,16,198,175,245,219,205,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
