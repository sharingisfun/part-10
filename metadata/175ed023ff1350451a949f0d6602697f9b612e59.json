By gradually adding features to the game, you'll learn the basics of Android programming. You'll also see how to build in audio and video support, add graphics using 2D and 3D OpenGL, network with web pages and web services, and store data with SQLite. You'll also learn how to publish your applications to the Android Market.\n\nThe #1 book for learning Android is now in its third edition. Every page and example was reviewed and updated for compatibility with the latest versions. Freshly added material covers installing applications to the SD card, supporting multi-touch, and creating live wallpaper. You'll also find plenty of real-world advice on how to support all the Android versions in use today-everything from Donut (Android 1.5) to FroYo (Android 2.2) and beyond.\n\nIf you'd rather be coding than reading about coding, this book is for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:175ed023ff1350451a949f0d6602697f9b612e59","amp;dn":"Hello+Android+3rd+edition+July+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"175ed023ff1350451a949f0d6602697f9b612e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,94,208,35,255,19,80,69,26,148,159,13,102,2,105,127,155,97,46,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
