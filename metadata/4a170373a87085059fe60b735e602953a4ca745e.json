Each  of  the      \n         shards  is  a  little  world  unto   itself,   with      \n         geography and denizens of its own. The  power  over      \n         the shards is bitterly contested  by  Masters,  the      \n         immortal beings mortals believe to  be  gods.  Take      \n         the role of the mighty Master and shape the destiny      \n         of Eador! It is in your power to deliver the  world      \n         from ultimate destruction ÃƒÂ» or to choke it with  an      \n         iron fist of tyranny.
