The man himself emerges as one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most remarkable self-creations, a prosperous lawyer who became an ascetic in a loincloth wholly dedicated to political and social action. Lelyveld leads us step-by-step through the heroicÃ¢â‚¬â€and tragicÃ¢â‚¬â€last months of this selfless leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long campaign when his nonviolent efforts culminated in the partition of India, the creation of Pakistan, and a bloodbath of ethnic cleansing that ended only with his own assassination.\n\nIndia and its politicians were ready to place Gandhi on a pedestal as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Father of the NationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but were less inclined to embrace his teachings. Muslim support, crucial in his rise to leadership, soon waned, and the oppressed untouchablesÃ¢â‚¬â€for whom Gandhi spoke to Hindus as a wholeÃ¢â‚¬â€produced their own leaders.\n\nHere is a vital, brilliant reconsideration of GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary struggles on two continents, of his fierce but, finally, unfulfilled hopes, and of his ever-evolving legacy, which more than six decades after his death still ensures his place as IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social conscienceÃ¢â‚¬â€and not just IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9114034020f344eeebb7d078b5dead8262879b","amp;dn":"Great+Soul+-+Mahatma+Gandhi+and+His+Struggle+with+India","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9114034020f344eeebb7d078b5dead8262879b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,145,20,3,64,32,243,68,238,235,183,208,120,181,222,173,130,98,135,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
