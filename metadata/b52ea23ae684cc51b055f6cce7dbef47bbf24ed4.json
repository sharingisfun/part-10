I stored the files as FLAC to prevent re-encoding, but the original source is likely MP3 or Vorbis. I don't know what the original sample rate was. This is as good as I could get it. Also, the beginning and ending of the tracks is not entirely accurate, but I made sure not to remove any non-zero signal. I'd rather have a bit of silence at the end than to cut away music.\nTo convert to a portable, lossy file, I recommend encoding to OGG Vorbis using the latest version of aoTuV, or encoding to Opus using Mozilla's build of Opus-Tools.\n\n___________________________________\nEncoded format:\n\nFree Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), encoded using Audacity\n44100 Hz, 32bit\nStereo\n\nSource format:\nUnknown, stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52ea23ae684cc51b055f6cce7dbef47bbf24ed4","amp;dn":"Two+Steps+From+Hell+-+Open+Conspiracy+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52ea23ae684cc51b055f6cce7dbef47bbf24ed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,46,162,58,230,132,204,81,176,85,246,204,231,219,239,71,187,242,78,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
