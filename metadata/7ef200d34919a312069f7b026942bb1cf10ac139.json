Following the nationalist example of BedÃ…â„¢ich Smetana, DvoÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ¡k frequently employed features of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia (then parts of the Austrian Empire and now constituting the Czech Republic). DvoÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ¡k's own style has been described as 'the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them'.[1]\n\nBorn in Nelahozeves, DvoÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ¡k displayed his musical gifts at an early age. After graduating from an organ school in Prague, he began writing his first composition at the age of 20. In the 1860s, he played as a violist in the Bohemian Provisional Theater Orchestra and taught piano lessons. In 1873, he married Anna Ã„Å’ermÃƒÂ¡kovÃƒÂ¡, and left the orchestra to pursue another career as a church organist. He wrote several compositions during this period. DvoÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ¡k's music attracted the interest of Johannes Brahms, who assisted his career; he was also supported by the critic Eduard Hanslick.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k,_Anton%C3%ADn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k,_Anton%C3%ADn&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ef200d34919a312069f7b026942bb1cf10ac139","amp;dn":"Antonin+Dvorak+Complete+Sheet+Music+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ef200d34919a312069f7b026942bb1cf10ac139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,242,0,211,73,25,163,18,6,159,123,2,105,66,187,28,241,10,193,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
