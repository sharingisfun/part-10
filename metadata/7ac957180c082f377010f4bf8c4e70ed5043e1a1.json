Thom Yorke and co. may no longer\nhave any ties to their old label, but Capitol has the band's entire\npre-In Rainbows catalog at its disposal. And if there's still money to\nbe made off of these old Radiohead records, best believe Capitol is\ngoing to make it.\n\nLast year, the label released a Radiohead greatest-hits collection\nwithout the blessing of the band. We hated it. But this past March, the\nlabel released expanded double- and triple-disc versions of their first\nthree albums, and we loved it.\n\nSee, there's a difference between good reissues and bad reissues. The\nfull-album reissues are the good kind. With those first three albums,\nCapitol crammed in every B-side and rarity they could find, and in\ndoing so they actually managed to flesh out those classic titles (and\none not-so-classic title) even further. And, of course, the albums\nthemselves are still great. We dropped 10.0s on the expanded versions\nof both The Bends and OK Computer, and we're probably not done handing\nout rave reviews yet.\n\nOn August 25, Capitol will complete their expanded reissue project with\nthe next three Radiohead albums: 2000's Kid A, 2001's Amnesiac, and\n2003's Hail to the Thief. Once again, these reissues come stuffed to\nthe gills with B-sides, live songs, studio sessions, and everything\nelse that didn't make it onto the actual albums. And the\neven-more-deluxe Special Collectors Editions will also come with DVDs,\nwhich will include music videos and TV performances.\n\nEvery Radiohead album after Pablo Honey is arguably a masterpiece; even\nHail to the Thief has its staunch defenders. So we are eagerly awaiting\nthese reissues, whether the band is happy about them or not,\nunfortunately.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ac957180c082f377010f4bf8c4e70ed5043e1a1","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-Amnesiac_%28Collectors_Edition%29-2CD-2009-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ac957180c082f377010f4bf8c4e70ed5043e1a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,201,87,24,12,8,47,55,112,16,244,191,140,78,112,237,80,67,225,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
