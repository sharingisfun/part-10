A lifelong bachelor, Dravic suddenly falls for Eva Ras, several years his junior. Though a flawlessly expert engineer, Dravic is hopelessly inept when its comes to courtship. He eventually loses Ras to someone who knows the score. The predictable but likeable Man is Not a Bird is directed in a refreshing free-form fashion (intercutting &quot;reality&quot; footage of the bleakness indigenous to mid-1960s Yugoslavia) by Dusa Makaveyev, whose first film this was; Makaveyev would go on to international fame by virtue of 1967&amp;#039;s controversial Love Affair: Or, the Case of the Missing Telephone Girl.\nHal Erickson\n\nThanks to hellboytr for the upload at KG\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
