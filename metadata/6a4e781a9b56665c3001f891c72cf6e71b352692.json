And they're doing pretty well, too, but is love enough to keep their legal battles at bay? Speaking of love and battles, Jughead and Ethel have some planning to do... but hopefully their stubbornness won't get in the way! And Kevin's trying his best to not let people's perceptions of him effect his Senate job, perhaps some encouraging words is all he needs. And Clay's back to work -- but things still seem new and strange. Could it just be his imagination?\n\nArchie Marries Betty -- &quot;Not So Great Expectations!&quot;: Archie's finally had enough of Betty's busy schedule -- and he's not the only one! Will all of her hard work have paid off or has it only made matters worse? And who is it Archie's really mad at -- Betty for neglecting him? Or himself for being selfish and feeling guilty? Meanwhile, Kevin dives head first into the investigation on the nearby mall shooting after discovering that the tragedy hit closer to home than he ever could have imagined. And Jughead's waiting on bated breath as Midge's due date draws closer and closer. Oh baby, things are crazy in Riverdale!&quot;\n\nPlease seed and enjoy. :-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4e781a9b56665c3001f891c72cf6e71b352692","amp;dn":"Life+With+Archie+034+%282014%29+%28Forsythe-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4e781a9b56665c3001f891c72cf6e71b352692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,78,120,26,155,86,102,92,48,1,248,145,199,44,246,231,27,53,38,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
