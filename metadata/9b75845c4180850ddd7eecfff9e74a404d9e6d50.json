Morrison \n\nIn the 1970s a handful of brewers in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia were tired of the traditional light and flavorless American beers and began exploring ways to make better beer brewed from local ingredients. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“microbrewsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (as they were originally called) caught on, and the Northwest quickly became the center of the craft beer movement that is now flourishing and spreading across the United States, Canada, and the world. \n\nCraft Beers of the Pacific Northwest is a suds-soaked adventure through the 115 key breweries and brew pubs in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Lisa Morrison, aka The Beer Goddess, has included every brewery worth visiting, from pioneers like McMenamins, whose Hillsdale Brewery &amp; Public House in southwest Portland was the first brewpub in Oregon, to a new generation of start ups like Upright Brewing, a production brewery that is creating French-Belgian inspired, open-fermented beers.\n\nWith 18 walkable pub-crawls, a beer primer and glossary, a list of the best bottle shops, Craft Beers of the Pacific Northwest has everything a beer lover needs to navigate the best of what the region has to offer.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my other Brewing Books, Zymurgy and BYO torrents\n                                             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&lt;/a&gt;\t(NOTE: If TPB keeps changing domains (ie... .org to .sx to .se), you will have to change it yourselves to see my other torrents)\t \n\n\n***************************************\n\t\t\t\nAlways looking for new brewing books digital or otherwise.
