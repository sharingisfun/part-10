It follows the book closely as author Spoerl also wrote the script for the movie. Both tell the story of a famous writer going undercover as a pupil at a small town secondary school after his friends tell him that he missed out on the best part of growing up by being educated at home. The story in the book takes place during the Weimar Republic in Germany. The movie was produced and released in Germany during the last years of World War II and has been called a &quot;masterpiece of timeless, cheerful escapism.&quot;[1] The movie stars Heinz RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hmann in the role of the student Hans Pfeiffer, which is remarkable as RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hmann was already 42 years old at that time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img379.imageshack.us/img379/9671/vlcsnap422693.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img379.imageshack.us/img379/9671/vlcsnap422693.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/7619/vlcsnap422854.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/7619/vlcsnap422854.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img70.imageshack.us/img70/4524/vlcsnap423470.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img70.imageshack.us/img70/4524/vlcsnap423470.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------not my rip-------------\n\nFile size: 706MB\nRuntime: 1h 33min.\nFrame Size: 720x576\n\nMajor type: Video\nSub type: DivX MPEG-4 Version 5 (DX50)\nFourCC: DX50 (DivX 5)\nBit planes: 24\nDimensions: 720x576\nAvgTimePerFrame: 400000\nFPS: 25,00\n\nMajor type: Audio\nSub type: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nChannels: 1\nAudio tag: 0x0055 (MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3))\nFrequence: 48000 Hz\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
