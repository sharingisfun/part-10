A series of bloody, tragic and impossible crimes would suggest someone is carrying out copycat Jack the Ripper murders. The murders are investigated by our three unlikely heroes: Chandler, a fast-tracked, media savvy DI on his first big murder case; Miles, nearing retirement, a front-line, hard-bitten DS, and Buchan, the eccentrically brilliant Jack the Ripper tour guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee45674da6b38f90e9c6edebd47851a43976684","amp;dn":"Whitechapel.Season.1.480p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee45674da6b38f90e9c6edebd47851a43976684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,228,86,116,218,107,56,249,14,156,110,222,189,71,133,26,67,151,102,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
