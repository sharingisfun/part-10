Though she becomes his mainstay, counselling and guiding him, his blind allegiance to Duryodhana is beyond her power to change.\n\nThe story of Uruvi and Karna unfolds against the backdrop of the struggle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. As events build up leading to the great war of the Mahabharata, Uruvi is a witness to the twists and turns of Karna s fate; and how it is inextricably linked to divine design.\n\nA splendid saga from the pages of the Mahabharata, Karna s Wife: The Outcast s Queen brings its characters alive in all their majesty.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical/Mythology ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9606ea412a7ab3d9ebcd8f67db67a2a955c94d8b","amp;dn":"Karna%27s+Wife+by+Kavita+Kane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9606ea412a7ab3d9ebcd8f67db67a2a955c94d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,6,234,65,42,122,179,217,235,205,143,103,219,103,162,169,85,201,77,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
