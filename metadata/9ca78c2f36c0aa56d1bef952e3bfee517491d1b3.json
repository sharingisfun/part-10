Reissued by the Blue Note label (July 2003), Joe TorresÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album feels as contemporary as can be. \nPercussionist Joe Torres pioneered the Latin Jazz movement in the early sixties. He played with the well-known group of Charlie and Eddie Palmieri, Arsenio RodrÃƒÂ­guezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band, the JosÃƒÂ© Curbelo band, and Noro Morales in addition to playing with the great Dizzy Gillespie and Celia Cruz Ã¢â‚¬â€ the queen of salsa. Using the cream of Los AngelesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ musicians and arrangers, he created a fabulous album featuring Cha Cha ChÃƒÂ¡s, Mambos and Latinized arrangements of tunes like Sunny and Eleanor Rigby.\nThe first track is the hit Get Out Of My Way, which has appeared on numerous compilations worldwide and was featured in the biographical film PiÃƒÂ±ero, recounting the life of the famous Newyorican poet. This tune is a definite winner because it is just the right speed for suave dancing. \nThe CD offers a great Latin Jazz fusion, combining dazzling jazz and Latin sizzle. With mostly instrumental tracks, it caters to Jazz lovers. Yo SalÃƒÂ­, composed by Torres with vocals by Ric DeSilva, it is danceable as a Salsa piece as well . . .\n\n\n\nThe explosive new band of  JOE TORRES\n\nLatino Con Soul     1967\n\n- CD\n- Remastered\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nMusicians:\nJoe Torres - Timbales, Leader\nGary Barone - Trumpet\nSteve Huffsteter - Trumpet on #9 &amp; #10\nBill Hood - Tenor Sax\nVictor Feldman - Piano\nMax Bennett - Bass\nBobby (Papi) Torres - Percussion\nOrlando LÃƒÂ³pez - Percussion\nMario Tholmer - Percussion\nRic DeSilva - Vocals \n\n\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles in 1966\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca78c2f36c0aa56d1bef952e3bfee517491d1b3","amp;dn":"Joe+Torres+-+Latino+Con+Soul+1967+-+320Kbps+-+Latin+Jazz+%23+DrBn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca78c2f36c0aa56d1bef952e3bfee517491d1b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,167,140,47,54,192,170,86,209,190,249,82,227,191,238,81,116,145,209,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
