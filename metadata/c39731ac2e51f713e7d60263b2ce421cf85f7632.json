Following will be rebuilt, but will lose this incomparable freshness here.\n&quot; Quasar &quot; is a nice jazzy instrumental. &quot; Soldi &quot; in its disarming simplicity &quot; But if you have no money, no money you will make &quot; has the typical look of the rocker Finardi vintage.\n&quot; Ninnananna &quot; anticipates some ' romantic pop vein that will develop later.\nWith &quot; Sulla strada &quot; back to rock the road with references to the first job ( &quot;finally say goodbye to my lord &quot; ) and the first tour.\n&quot; Voglio &quot; has a text dreamer and optimist, with references to space issues. \n&quot; Oggi ho imparato a volare &quot; is another nice piece , simple as many of the best songs of our own.\n&quot; La C.I.A. &quot; is sung in English and it should not be surprising, given that Finardi then make an entire disc sung in that language. In this case, however, the chorus is in Italian .\n&quot; La Paura Del Domani &quot; is almost spoken, the music is in the second floor and is a much smaller piece, which closes in a somewhat ' shabby a good record.\n\nThe album is listed in the ranking of the 100 most beautiful Italian records of all time according to Rolling Stone Italy at number 27.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39731ac2e51f713e7d60263b2ce421cf85f7632","amp;dn":"Eugenio+Finardi+-+Sugo%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39731ac2e51f713e7d60263b2ce421cf85f7632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,151,49,172,46,81,247,19,231,214,2,99,178,206,66,28,248,95,118,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
