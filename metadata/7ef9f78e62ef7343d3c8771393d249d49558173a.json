Though I played it fine with MX player on my android device.\n\nIf you want to play it on your PC, you can easily use VLC, MPC-HC, GOM Player or any other modern media player. just be sure you got the latest version of them.\nIf you have no video and only the audio is playing, try to update your player or use another one. Installing LAV Filters may help.\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the format, check this out:\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is nothing you can compare with x264 releases so don't let the size scare you. small sizes don't always mean LOW QUALITIES. This is the best you can get in this size.\n\nCheck screenshots or the sample (if there's any) then download it and Enjoy.
