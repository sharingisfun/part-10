The idea of getting 8 musicians together playing Yes music \nmakes some people go over the moon. But to me it's not the best, actually. How can you \nadd a second guitar in complexly structured songs such as And You And I and Heart of the \nSunrise? Or play Your Is No Disgrace with two drummers? It just doesn't work that well, \nin my opinion.\n\nBut there are interesting points, of course. Awaken is long, and its interlude is fantastic. \nThe solo moments are all good: Steve, Trevor, Rick and Chris can do wonders alone... but \nwhen they're all together things don't work that well.This is from soundboard, and the quality \nis so good that it's often called Yesshows 1991\n\n\n\nSet List:\n\nFirebird Suite\nYours Is No Disgrace\nRhythm Of Love\nShock To The System\nHeart Of The Sunrise\nClap\nMake It Easy/Owner Of A Lonely Heart\nAnd You And I\nDrum Duet\nChanges\nI've Seen All Good People\nSolly's Beard\nSaving My Heart/Whitefish/Amazing Grace\nLift Me Up\nWakeman Solo\nAwaken\nRoundabout\n\n\n1h 58mn | 1.46 GiB | 720x480 | 1768 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 432 Kbps Vbr | 6 ch | QF 0.130","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe8300cad72753371eda085dc169744e8749139","amp;dn":"YES+-+Union+Tour+1991+DVDrip+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe8300cad72753371eda085dc169744e8749139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,232,48,12,173,114,117,51,113,237,160,133,220,22,151,68,232,116,145,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
