After breaking her engagement with her Israeli boyfriend, she asks the Israeli taxi driver Hanna to take her anywhere but the place where she is. Hanna tells her that she needs to go Jordan's Free Zone, a place surrounded by Syria, Iraq and South Arabia, to receive US$ 30,000.00 that the Palestinian partner of her husband called &quot;The American&quot; owes to him. When they arrive in the location, they do not find the &quot;The American&quot; but a Palestinian woman called Leila. Hanna forces Leila to take her to meet &quot;The American&quot; in his Oasis, but when they arrive there, she is informed that his son has burnt the place, stolen the money and crossed the border. \n\n\n\nLanguages: English, Hebrew, Arabian, Spanish\nSub srt: Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f7fabcc31ef362b5f3479c40f8087eb54d35c0e","amp;dn":"Free+Zone+2005+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f7fabcc31ef362b5f3479c40f8087eb54d35c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,127,171,204,49,239,54,43,95,52,121,196,15,128,135,235,84,211,92,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
