Struggling for purpose and belonging, bucking against the ties that bind, they form a band and a movement under the moniker The Sleez Sisters. Championed by radio deejay Johnny LaGuardia, the girls screech through town, wreaking havoc and shining an unwavering spotlight on a grimy and neglected neighbourhood. The plot of the film embodies a punk rock ethic of misunderstood youth articulating their frustrations toward adult authority through music. For a long time the soundtrack album of this film was the only available recording of the The Ramones' song I Wanna Be Sedated.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x464, 23.976 fps, 01h50m48s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\nRatio: 1.85:1\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles Croatian, Serbian, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/a4uz8rzvl/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/anpyuk8xd/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/kmaxh1icx/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/qoik7j6sx/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/cw45bwg1d/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4480f696e62e4021d0441333ea83f2ec12b8143","amp;dn":"Times+Square+%5B1980+-+USA%5D+NYC+punk+girl+runaways","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4480f696e62e4021d0441333ea83f2ec12b8143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,72,15,105,110,98,228,2,29,4,65,51,62,168,63,46,193,43,129,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
