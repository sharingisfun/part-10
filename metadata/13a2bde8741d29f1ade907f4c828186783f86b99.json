The mother-daughter team realized there were very few good Bible charts, time lines, and maps on the market for their classes and began creating their own. Other teachers started asking for the charts and the company was born.\n\nFrom those few charts locally, to thousands of loyal customers worldwide today, Rose Publishing is the only Christian publisher that specializes in graphics-rich products. Rose has become known for providing quality products developed by expert authors, including professors and consultants from evangelical Christian colleges and seminaries. The management team and sales staff is made of up industry professionals with years of experience.\n\nRose Publishing creates full-color products (award-winning books, wall charts, pamphlets, DVD-based curriculum, and PowerPointsÃ‚Â®). They are designed for personal, church, small group, and school use, and are packed with easy-to-understand diagrams, illustrations, maps, photos, charts, and time lines to bring Christian teachings to life.\n\n\nDeceived To Delivered : Part of the Freedom Series by Michelle Borquez, Julie Terwillinger, Paige Henderson\nDivorce to Wholeness : Part of the Freedom Series by Michelle Borquez, Sharon Kay Ball, Paige Henderson\nThe Trinity : What is the Trinity and What Do Christians Believe?\nBreaking The Bonds Of Fear : Fear, Worry, Anxiety by Joni Eareckson Tada\nAnger: Aim It In the Right Direction : Anger at God by Joni Eareckson Tada\nA Thankful Heart in a World of Hurt : Finding Happiness by Joni Eareckson Tada\nWhen Is It Right to Die? : End-of-Life Questions by Joni Eareckson Tada\nWhere's My Miracle? : Unanswered Prayer by Joni Eareckson Tada\nNo Longer Alone : Loneliness by Joni Eareckson Tada\n10 Keys to Witnessing to Cults : Share the Truth with Respect by Ron Rhodes, Christy Darlington\nBible Overview Book by Benjamin Galen, et al\nChristianity, Cults, and the Occult : Compare 11 Groups with Biblical Christianity by Paul Carden\n10 Questions &amp; Answers on Mormonism : Key Beliefs, Practices, and History by Paul Carden\nThe Life of the Apostle Paul : 200 Key Facts at a Glance\nSpeaking God's Language : Prayer by Joni Eareckson Tada\nPain and Providence : Chronic Pain and Illness by Joni Eareckson Tada\nGaining a Hopeful Spirit : Hope by Joni Eareckson Tada\nMaking Sense of Suffering : Suffering by Joni Eareckson Tada\nGod's Hand in Our Hardship : God's Sovereignty by Joni Eareckson Tada\nWhen God Seems Unjust : Suffering Through Injustice by Joni Eareckson Tada\nWho I Am in Christ : Your True Identity by William Brent Ashby\nFatherhood : Make a Lifetime of DIfference\nWhat The Bible Says About Forgiveness : Key Bible Verses on Forgiveness\nChristian History Made Easy : A quick and colorful guide by Timothy Paul Jones\nRose Guide To The Tabernacle by William Brent Ashby and Benjamin Galan\nChristianity and Eastern Religions : Compare the Beliefs of 6 Eastern Religions\nFear To Courage : Part of the Freedom Series by Kim Vastine, Paige Henderson, Michelle Borquez\n10 Questions And Answers On Jehovah's Witnesses : Key Beliefs, Practices, and History by Paul Carden\nChristianity, Cults And Religions Pamphlet : Compare 20 Religions and Cults with Biblical Christianity by Paul Carden\nChristianity, Cults and Religions Leader's Guide by Paul Carden\nChristianity, Cults and Religions Participant's Guide by Paul Carden\nThe Tabernacle : Symbolism in the Tabernacle\nThe Temple : The Temple Throughout Bible History\nBible Overview : Know Themes, Facts, and Key Verses at a Glance\nNames of God : 21 Names of God and Their Meanings\nNames of the Holy Spirit : 32 Names of the Holy Spirit and Their Meanings by William Brent Ashby\nChrist in the Passover : Celebrate a Christian Seder by Benjamin Galan\nThe Fruit of the Spirit : How the Spirit Works in and Through Believers\nFeasts of the Bible : Jewish Roots of Believers in Yeshua (Jesus)\nIslam and Christianity : Compares Basic Teachings and Beliefs by Bruce Green\nHow We Got the Bible : A Time Line of Key Events in the History of the Bible\nHow to Study the Bible : Bible Study Made Easy\nUnderstanding the Book of Revelation : Ways to Interpret Revelation by William Brent Ashby and Benjamin Galan\n100 Prophecies Fulfilled By Jesus : Messianic Prophecies Make Before the Birth of Christ\nDenominations Comparison : Compare 12 Major Denominations and Their Beliefs\nThe Christmas Story : Scripture from the Gospels and the Prophets by Loren D.
