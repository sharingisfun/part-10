As his journey deepens, he painstakingly reports on the occupied Palestinians challenging schemes of demographic separation through unarmed protest. He talks at length to the leaders and youth of Palestinian society inside Israel now targeted by security service dragnets and legislation suppressing their speech, and provides in-depth reporting on the small band of Jewish Israeli dissidents who have shaken off a conformist mindset that permeates the media, schools, and the military.\nThrough his far-ranging travels, Blumenthal illuminates the present by uncovering the ghosts of the pastÃ¢â‚¬â€the histories of Palestinian neighborhoods and villages now gone and forgotten; how that history has set the stage for the current crisis of Israeli society; and how the Holocaust has been turned into justification for occupation.\nA brave and unflinching account of the real facts on the ground, Goliath is an unprecedented and compelling work of journalis\nGenre: Politics, Sociology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c165ad014c4d779a4ee28f956196e8c7a909a4","amp;dn":"Goliath+-+Max+Blumenthal.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c165ad014c4d779a4ee28f956196e8c7a909a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,193,101,173,1,76,77,119,154,78,226,143,149,97,150,232,199,169,9,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
