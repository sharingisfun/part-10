We'll start by using a primitive shape to build a fuel tank for a flame thrower or spray weapon.\n\nWe'll then use the Pen Tool to draw out a custom base shape around that tank. We'll learn to add thickness to drawn shapes and to create clean quad geometry. We'll extract polygons to create additional objects and use the Tube tool to build a connected fuel hose. We'll put all of the tools we've learned to this point into practice to build our weapon before cleaning up our scene, naming our objects, and grouping things together.\n\nThese courses are designed to be taken in sequence so we really encourage you to start with Volume 1 and Volume 2 before continuing with this section. We also encourage you to take advantage of the assignments that follow each volume. These assignments will allow you to take what you've learned and apply those tools and techniques to your own projects. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ad3a5dbdae6016ea180bc3396b96c420d31bed","amp;dn":"Quick+Start+to+Modeling+in+MODO+Vol+3+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0ad3a5dbdae6016ea180bc3396b96c420d31bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,173,58,93,189,174,96,22,234,24,11,195,57,107,150,196,32,211,27,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
