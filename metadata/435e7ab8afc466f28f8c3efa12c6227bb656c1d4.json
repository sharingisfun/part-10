Gen is a young boy living a struggling yet satisfying life in the city of Hiroshima, that has been strangely spared by the bombing taken in almost every other Japanese City. Food is scarce, and Gen's family is suffering from severe malnutrition, which endangeres his pregnant mother. There isn't much spare time as Gen and his little brother Shinji help their father and mother at work and try to make sure their family survives the tought times. Little do they know, what the Americans have in store for the city of Hiroshima and as of the 6th of August 1945, their lives are about to change dramatically.\n \n ANN Link..........: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=924\n IMDb Link.........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085218/\n AniDB Link........: http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=627\n\n Source............: Geneon 2006 US R1 DVD9\n DVD Format........: NTSC\n DVD Size..........: DVD9\n Programs Used.....: tsMuxeR, MeGUI(AVISynth, x264, Aften AC-3, Nero AAC), MKVtoolnix(MKVmergeGUI, MKVextractGUI)\n\n Resolution........: 636x480\n Aspect Ratio......: 4:3\n Framerate.........: 23.976\n Interlace.........: Progressive\n\n Video Language....: English\n Video Codec.......: h.264\n Video Bitrate.....: 1500kbps\n\n Audio Language....: Japanese\n Audio Codec.......: AC-3 2.0\n Audio Bitrate.....: 128kbps\n\n Subtitles.........: English Subs\n Subtitle Format...: SRT\n\n Complete..........: Movie\n Length............: 1 hr, 23 min\n *from Barefoot Gen The Movies 1 and 2 set\n \n\n Please report all problems with files or torrents!\n If you have any questions, comments, or requests please contact us.\n\n\n #@Home on irc.anirena.com\n &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5c0834390c2e333a332f352f281c3b313d3530723f3331&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435e7ab8afc466f28f8c3efa12c6227bb656c1d4","amp;dn":"Barefoot+Gen+%5B%40Home%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435e7ab8afc466f28f8c3efa12c6227bb656c1d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,94,122,184,175,196,102,242,143,140,62,250,18,198,34,123,182,86,193,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
