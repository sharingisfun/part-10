Evans is featured with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, guitarist Jim Hall, bassist Percy Heath, and drummer Philly Joe Jones performing five veteran standards (highlighted by &quot;You and the Night and the Music,&quot; &quot;You Go to My Head,&quot; and &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams&quot;), plus the pianist's blues &quot;Interplay.&quot; Excellent music. [A Japanese version added a bonus track.]\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nYou may be slightly put off the first time you listen to this CD if you're only familiar with Bill Evans in a trio or from 'Kind of Blue'. The combination is unusual, maybe even unique, for Evans and it may take a few tracks to adjust. But if you haven't embraced this CD by the last notes of 'When You Wish Upon a Star', then the blues 'Interplay' will nail it for you. Some critics have pooh-poohed Evans' ability by saying he couldn't swing. I really don't understand that criticism at all, but for those who contend Evans couldn't play the blues, 'Interplay', which Evans wrote, proves he could. The personnel are all first rate, particularly Jim Hall and one of my favorite drummers, the fantastic Philly Joe Jones. The others, Freddie Hubbard and Percy Heath, are up to their usual high quality, too. My favorite tracks are 'Interplay', 'Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams', and 'When You Wish Upon a Star'.\n\nThis disc, like so many of Bill Evans' works, is one of those that one can be enjoyed over and over. Even so, I have been listening to Evans' music for many years and I don't recall meeting anyone who owns this CD. That may be due to the fact that many view it as an experiment that failed given that Evans didn't lead another quintet like this again. I don't know if Evans and the other players considered it an experiment, but it surely was no failure. It is one of my five favorite Evans CDs.
