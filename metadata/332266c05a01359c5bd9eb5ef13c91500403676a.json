An international bestseller, a nominee for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and made into a critically acclaimed movie, Shilts' expose revealed why AIDS was allowed to spread unchecked during the early 80's while the most trusted institutions ignored or denied the threat.  One of the few true modern classics, it changed and framed how AIDS was discussed in the following years. Now republished in a special 20th Anniversary edition, And the Band Played On remains one of the essential books of our time.\n\nPrint Length: 660 pages\nPage Numbers Source ISBN: 0312374631\nPublisher: Souvenir Press (November 3, 2011)\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332266c05a01359c5bd9eb5ef13c91500403676a","amp;dn":"And+the+Band+Played+On%3A+AIDS+Epidemic+%281987%29+by+Randy+Shilts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332266c05a01359c5bd9eb5ef13c91500403676a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,34,102,192,90,1,53,156,91,217,235,94,241,60,145,80,4,3,103,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
