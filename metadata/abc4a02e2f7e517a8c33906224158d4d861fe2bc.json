Passionate and strong-willed, Gracie is blocked from all sides as she argues the rights of women to play competitive soccer.  The film is based on the real-life story of actress Elizabeth Shue (who plays Gracie's mom), who championed the cause of women's sports as a teenager.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc4a02e2f7e517a8c33906224158d4d861fe2bc","amp;dn":"Gracie+%282007%29%28Rated+PG-13%29.Carrotann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc4a02e2f7e517a8c33906224158d4d861fe2bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,196,160,46,47,126,81,122,140,51,144,98,36,21,141,77,134,31,226,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
