Four leading Cisco IPv6 experts present a practical approach to organizing and executing your large-scale IPv6 implementation. They show how IPv6 affects existing network designs, describe common IPv4/IPv6 coexistence mechanisms, guide you in planning, and present validated configuration examples for building labs, pilots, and production networks.\n\nThe authors first review some of the drivers behind the acceleration of IPv6 deployment in the enterprise. Next, they introduce powerful new IPv6 services for routing, QoS, multicast, and management, comparing them with familiar IPv4 features and behavior. Finally, they translate IPv6 concepts into usable configurations. Up-to-date and practical, IPv6 for Enterprise Networks is an indispensable resource for every network engineer, architect, manager, and consultant who must evaluate, plan, migrate to, or manage IPv6 networks.\n\nIdentify how IPv6 affects enterprises\nUnderstand IPv6 services and the IPv6 features that make them possible\nReview the most common tranisition mechanisms including dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) networks, IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels, and IPv6 over MPLS\nCreate IPv6 network designs that reflect proven principles of modularity, hierarchy, and resiliency\nSelect the best implementation options for your organization\nBuild IPv6 lab environments\nConfigure IPv6 step-by-step in campus, WAN/branch, and data center networks\nIntegrate production-quality IPv6 services into IPv4 networks\nImplement virtualized IPv6 networks\nDeploy IPv6 for remote access\nManage IPv6 networks efficiently and cost-effectively\nThis book is part of the Networking Technology Series from Cisco PressÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, which offers networking professionals valuable information for constructing efficient networks, understanding new technologies, and building successful careers.\n\nBook Details\nHardcover: 400 pages\nPublisher: Cisco Press (March 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1587142279\nISBN-13: 978-1587142277","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88911fd96f7fb96a1ee56b1f1c087f35aa9740c","amp;dn":"Cisco.Press.IPv6.for.Enterprise.Networks.Mar.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88911fd96f7fb96a1ee56b1f1c087f35aa9740c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,137,17,253,150,247,251,150,161,238,86,177,241,192,135,243,90,169,116,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
