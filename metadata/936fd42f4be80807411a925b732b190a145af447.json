She opened her laptop, pulled out some bread and cheese, and then, as one does, started drinking. The video was called &quot;Butter Yo Sh*t&quot; and online sensation My Drunk Kitchen was born.\n\nMy Drunk Kitchen (the book!) includes recipes, stories, color photographs, and tips and tricks to inspire your own adventures in tipsy cooking. Hannah offers cocktail recommendations, culinary advice (like, remember to turn off the oven when you go to bed), and shares never-before-seen recipes such as:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Hartwich (Knowledge is ingenuity! Learn from the past!)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Can Bake (Inventing things is hard! You don't have to start from scratch!)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Latke Shotkes (Plan ahead to avoid a night of dread!)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Tiny Sandwiches (Size doesn't matter! Aim to satisfy.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Saltine Nachos (It's not about resources! It's about being resourceful.)\n\nIn the end, My Drunk Kitchen may not be your go-to guide for your next dinner party . . . but it will make you laugh and drink . . . I mean think . . . about life.\n\n\nBy Hannah Hart\nPublished by HarperCollins, Dey Street Books in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 240 pages, English (0062293044)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936fd42f4be80807411a925b732b190a145af447","amp;dn":"My+Drunk+Kitchen+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29++%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936fd42f4be80807411a925b732b190a145af447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,111,212,47,75,232,8,7,65,26,146,91,115,43,25,10,20,90,244,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
