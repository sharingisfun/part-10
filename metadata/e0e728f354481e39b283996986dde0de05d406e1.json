He used images and objects, and the means of their production to draw draw parallels with cultural processes. Thus, by means of a variety of techniques, but principally the choice of images, their visual repetition and pictorial isolation, and the use of colour, Warhol makes us aware of contemporary materialism, political manipulation, economic exploitation, conspicuous consumption, media hero-worship, and the creation of artificially-induced needs and aspirations.
