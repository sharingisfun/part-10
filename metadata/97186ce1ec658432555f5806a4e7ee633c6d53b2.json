Nick Cohen argues that this view is dangerously naive. From the revolution in Iran that wasn't, to the Great Firewall of China and the imposition of super-injunctions from the filthy rich protecting their privacy, the traditional opponents of freedom of speech -- religious fanaticism, plutocratic power and dictatorial states -- are thriving, and in many respects finding the world a more comfortable place in the early 21st century than they did in the late 20th.\n\nThis is not an account of interesting but trivial disputes about freedom of speech: the rights and wrongs of shouting &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theatre, of playing heavy metal at 3 am in a built-up area or articulating extremist ideas in a school or university. Rather, this is a story that starts with the cataclysmic reaction of the Left and Right to the publication and denunciation of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; in 1988 that saw them jump into bed with radical extremists. It ends at the juncture where even in the transgressive, liberated West, where so much blood had been spilt for Freedom, where rebellion is the conformist style and playing the dissenter the smart career move in the arts and media, you can write a book and end up destroyed or dead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97186ce1ec658432555f5806a4e7ee633c6d53b2","amp;dn":"You+Can%27t+Read+This+Book+-+Censorship+in+an+Age+of+Freedom+%282012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97186ce1ec658432555f5806a4e7ee633c6d53b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,24,108,225,236,101,132,50,85,95,88,6,164,231,238,99,60,109,83,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
