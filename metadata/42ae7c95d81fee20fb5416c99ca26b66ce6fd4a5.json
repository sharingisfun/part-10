Down-to-earth and always open-minded, she draws on examples from Charles Dickens, Emily Dickinson, Henry James, and the Lord's Prayer, as well as from The Honeymooners, The Simpsons, David Foster Wallace, and Gillian Flynn. She takes us to see a copy of Noah Webster's groundbreaking Blue-Back Speller, on a quest to find out who put the hyphen in Moby-Dick, on a pilgrimage to the world's only pencil-sharpener museum, and inside the hallowed halls of The New Yorker and her work with such celebrated writers as Pauline Kael, Philip Roth, and George Saunders.\n\n ReadersÃ¢â‚¬â€and writersÃ¢â‚¬â€will find in Norris neither a scold nor a softie but a wise and witty new friend in love with language and alive to the glories of its use in America, even in the age of autocorrect and spell-check. As Norris writes, &quot;The dictionary is a wonderful thing, but you can't let it push you around.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ae7c95d81fee20fb5416c99ca26b66ce6fd4a5","amp;dn":"Between+You+%26amp%3B+Me%3A+Confessions+of+a+Comma+Queen+%282015%29epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ae7c95d81fee20fb5416c99ca26b66ce6fd4a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,174,124,149,216,31,238,32,251,84,22,201,156,162,107,102,206,111,212,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
