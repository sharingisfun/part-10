Lifelong insecurities and a wicked rebellious streak caused her to opt-out of a style. Now this case of fashion malpractice is putting her at risk of not being taken seriously by patients, or other doctors. With med school coming to an end Clinton and Stacy will use their style scalpels to convince Becca to grow up and start dressing like a medical professional. Or will her tank-top toting, flesh-belt wearing, condition be incurable.\n\nMediaInfo:\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 522 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 48s\nWriting application              : Lavf52.39.0\nWriting library                  : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.607\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.186\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 48s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 58.8 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06512de0319c04a496b50e694b779306912d5036","amp;dn":"What.Not.To.Wear+s08e26+Becca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06512de0319c04a496b50e694b779306912d5036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,81,45,224,49,156,4,164,150,181,14,105,75,119,147,6,145,45,80,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
