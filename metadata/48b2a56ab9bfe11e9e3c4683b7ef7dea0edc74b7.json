Though there are numerous weapons available, only two can be carried at a time, one of which cannot be replaced (Nick's silenced pistol). The available weapons also become virtually useless in the later levels, especially against the larger armored enemies. The low ammo totals for each weapon also force a dependence on Nick's psychic powers, which are much more effective in practice. The player is given a meter that limits the total amount of energy they can expend at any given point, though like any power meter it can be restored through various methods. Unlike the game's antagonists, In which each one is a master of one Psi power, Nick is unique in that he has access to the full range of psychic abilities, albeit in a more limited form than the more specialized psychics. Other than his psychic abilities and the weapons he can wield, Nick may also attack with a melee punch.\n\nExtract &amp; play, Xpadder &amp; game profile included.\n\nCompressed with Winrar, so use Winrar or 7zip to extract this game.\n\nScanned with Vipre AV, make sure your DirectX is up to date.\n                                                        \n                              ENJOY\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; http://bayimg.com/aaKBnaadE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bayimg.com/aaKBnaadE&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b2a56ab9bfe11e9e3c4683b7ef7dea0edc74b7","amp;dn":"Psi-Ops+The+Mindgate+Conspiracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b2a56ab9bfe11e9e3c4683b7ef7dea0edc74b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,178,165,106,185,191,225,30,158,60,70,131,183,239,125,234,14,220,116,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
