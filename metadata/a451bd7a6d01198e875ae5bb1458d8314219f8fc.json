Word search puzzles are the ones where you are given a list of words. You are also given a grid with letters on it. You must search the grid to find all the words from the list. The words camouflaged on the grid go in various directions: left to right, right to left, up and down, and diagonally in any direction. Each puzzle is based on a theme. Each puzzle has at least 40 words to be found. After all the words have been found, the puzzle has not been completed entirely. As a bonus, the remaining or extra letters on the grid can be arranged, in the order they are found on the grid, to make a sentence relevant to the topic. There is a complete Answer Key. Puzzles from 100 Thematic Word Search Puzzles can be used alone or with other thematically linked materials\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a451bd7a6d01198e875ae5bb1458d8314219f8fc","amp;dn":"100+Thematic+Word+Search+Puzzles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a451bd7a6d01198e875ae5bb1458d8314219f8fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,81,189,122,109,1,25,142,135,90,229,187,20,88,216,49,66,25,248,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
