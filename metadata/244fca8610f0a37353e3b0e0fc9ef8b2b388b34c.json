I remember the first time I tried to approach a girl, it sure wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pretty. My hand was shaking, my palms were sweaty and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m pretty sure my voice cracked when uttered my first words.\n\nWas it simply genetics at work? Was I born a man thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incompetent with women or is it just something I hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t figured out yet? All I knew is I wanted to change that part of my life, forever.  I was a man in need of a change!\n\nSo I started asking around on forums, then reading some books, observing some friends and I finally figured out what to say! Yay. Unfortunately, even though I knew what to say, women still werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t responding to me in the way that I wanted them to.\n\nWhat was wrong? WellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ everything.\n\nI was a geek with a few lines and a little knowledge on how women worked. Giving someone a few lines and pointers is like throwing someone in the ocean when they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t swim. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll remember that you have to move your arms (like youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll remember the lines), but youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be so panicked that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll flail all over the place and barely make it out alive.\n\nInstead, the ideal approach is to become a swimmer first by learning in a pool with a trained professional and you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even have to think about moving your arms, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just do it.\n\nThe man transformation program is very similar to this in the way that it transforms you into someone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great with women, so when you talk to them, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll automatically feel all tingly inside. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to remember pick up lines, or cheesy canned openers, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just be naturally attractive.\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be one of the very few guys that has women chasing them.\n\nThen when a woman actually gets to know you, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll love you for who you are because youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re being genuine.  ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what man transformation by David DeAngelo provides, it morphs you into a person that is so successful with women, once a woman finds you sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never let you go!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244fca8610f0a37353e3b0e0fc9ef8b2b388b34c","amp;dn":"David+DeAngelo+-+Man+Transformation+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244fca8610f0a37353e3b0e0fc9ef8b2b388b34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,79,202,134,16,240,163,115,83,227,176,224,252,158,248,178,179,136,179,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
