How exactly had it come to hit the rest of the world in the    :\n : face too? Just how broke are we really? Boomerang is a tragi-comic romp    :\n : across Europe, in which Lewis gives full vent to his storytelling genius.  :\n : The cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was   :\n : more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire:\n : societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not  :\n : normally afford to indulge. Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become   :\n : investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a piata   :\n : stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack.  :\n : The Irish wanted to stop being Irish. The Germans wanted to be even more   :\n : German. Michael Lewis's investigation of bubbles across Europe is          :\n : brilliantly, sadly hilarious. He also turns a merciless eye on America: on :\n : California, the epicentre of world consumption, where we see that a final  :\n : reckoning awaits the most avaricious of nations too. This is the ultimate  :\n : book of our times. It's time to brace ourselves for impact. And, with      :\n : Michael Lewis, to laugh out loud while we're doing it.                     :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ff404caa2c43c32eb933bf82c899239914ec0f","amp;dn":"Michael+Lewis+Boomerang+2011+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ff404caa2c43c32eb933bf82c899239914ec0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,255,64,76,170,44,67,195,46,185,51,191,130,200,153,35,153,20,236,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
