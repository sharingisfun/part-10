There are factories and villages in the northern side of the river, and workers and farmers live there. On the other hand, wealthy people live in the urban areas of the south with prestigious shrines and theatres. However, a fortuneteller prophesies that the river is flooding soon and the world will be end. The Lord has a grief to hear it. If one of the sides is sacrificed, another can be saved. But it can be a difficult decision. As the intentions and expectations of various people are getting involved in conflicts or incidents, the drums are beaten up, signifying the arrival of the flood.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Tambours Sur La Digue.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 062 Kbps\nLength            : 1.97 GiB for 2h 16mn 57s 84ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 480 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #3           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #4           : VobSub\nLanguage          : ru\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386066&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386066&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian\n\nAriane Mnouchkine - Tambours sur la digue (2003) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425e11201e0a0a051e946b89f73fa3a7206eae80","amp;dn":"Ariane+Mnouchkine+-+Tambours+sur+la+digue+%282003%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425e11201e0a0a051e946b89f73fa3a7206eae80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,94,17,32,30,10,10,5,30,148,107,137,247,63,163,167,32,110,174,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
