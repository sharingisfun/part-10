To assist in the making of Full Circle, Xzibit enlisted Keith Shocklee of the legendary Bomb Squad as co-executive producer. The Game, DJ Quik, Too Short, T-Pain and Tha Dogg Pound make up the many high-profile guests, and the Chappelle&amp;#039;s Show&amp;#039;s Donnell Rawlings makes a comedic appearance. The presence of West Coast veteran King Tee is particularly notable for being the first Likwit Crew rapper to appear on an Xzibit album since 2000&amp;#039;s Restless.\n\n&quot;Concentrate&quot; was released as the lead single. Produced by the Bay Area&amp;#039;s Rick Rock, it sampled and looped &quot;Nam My?h? Renge Ky?,&quot; a mantra that is chanted as the central practice of all forms of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFull Circle peaked on the Billboard album chart at #50, shipping 16,659 units. It has now sold 122,606 copies in America and 244,000 worldwide. The album only had one music video which was released for the single &quot;Concentrate&quot; and it was directed by Little X.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2fa723bc8253c61095924b7804b8d5afbfe6db1","amp;dn":"Xzibit+-+Full+Circle+%5B2006%5D+%5BHip+Hop%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2fa723bc8253c61095924b7804b8d5afbfe6db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,250,114,59,200,37,60,97,9,89,36,183,128,75,141,90,251,254,109,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
