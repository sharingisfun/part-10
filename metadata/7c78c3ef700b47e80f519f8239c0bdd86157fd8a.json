It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.\nI see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. \nOk pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. \nSurely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nJohn McLaughlin Discography - part 2\n\nA MUSIC torrent :)\n\nDig the musical experience of: John McLaughlin\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLaughlin_(musician)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLaughlin_(musician)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nJohn McLaughlin is one of pioneers and masters of jazz and fusion since the 70s since his collaborations with Miles Davis and his explorations of the indian music with Shakti or his fusion projects with Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Di Meola, De Lucia.... just to remember some names.\nA tremendously gifted guitarist but not only. As usual with my torrents I won't claim that this is his complete discography; anyway the 125 albums I collected here should satisfy the McLaughlin fans :)\n\nA big big thanks to hunterlucky60. The 70% of the material you will find here comes from his cyberlockers shares that I was still able to download even after the last pogroms on those sites.\n\nThe resulting discography was too big even for my usual enciclopedic standards so I split it in two parts.\nThis is the second part.\n\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)\n\n\nAlbums List:\n\nwith Miles Davis\n\n\t1969 - In a Silent Way\n\t1970 - Bitches Brew\n\t1970 - The Cellar Door Sessions\n\t1971 - Live-Evil\n\t1971 - Tribute to Jack Johnson\n\t1972 - On the Corner\n\t1974 - Big Fun\n\t1974 - Get Up With It\n\t1979 - Circle In The Round\n\t1981 - Directions\n\t1985 - You're Under Arrest\n\t1989 - Aura\n        \n\nwith Miroslav Vitous\n\n\t1970 - Infinite Search\n\t1970 - Purple\n\t2003 - Universal Syncopations\n        \n\nwith Radio String Quartet\n\n\t2007 - Celebrating the Mahavishnu Orchestra\n        \n\nwith Ranjit Barot\n\n\t2010 - Bada Boom\n        \n\nwith Remember Shakti\n\n\t1997-09-24 - Live at Queen Elizabeth Hall, Oldham\n\t1997-09-26 - Live at Symphony Hall, Birmingham\n\t1999 - Remember Shakti\n\t1999-06-27 - Live at Symphony Space, New York City\n\t2000 - The Believer\n\t2000-10-15 - Live at Leverkusener Jazztage, Leverkusen (FM broadcast)\n\t2001 - Saturday Night in Bombay\n\t2001-06-29 - Live at Sanders Theater, Cambridge\n\t2003-10-10 - Live at Sanders Theater, Cambridge\n\t2003-11-15 - Live at Victoria Hall, Geneve\n\t2004-07-02 - Live at Jazz a Vienne, Vienne\n\t2006-03-23 - Live at Grenoble Jazz Festival Voiron\n\t2009-10-23 - Live at the United Nations NY City Archive\n        \n\nwith Selvaganesh\n\n\t2006 - Soukha\n        \n\nwith Shakti\n\n\t1976 - A Handful Of Beauty\n\t1976 - Shakti with John McLaughlin\n\t1977 - Natural Elements\n\t1994 - The Best of Shakti\n        \n\nwith Shrinivas\n\n\t2008 - Samjanitha\n        \n\nwith Stanley Clarke\n\n\t1975 - Journey To Love\n\t1976 - School Days\n        \n\nwith The 4th Dimension\n\n\t2007 - Official Pirate\n\t2010 - To The One\n        \n\nwith The Graham Bond Organization\n\n\t1970 - Solid Bond - 160\n        \n\nwith the Zawinul Syndicate\n\n\t1995 - Den Haag Live\n        \n\nwith Tony Williams\n\n\t1969 - Emergency\n\t1970 - The Tony Williams Lifetime - Turn It Over\n        \n\nwith Trilok Gurtu\n\n\t1995 - Molom - A Legend Of Mongolia\n\t2007 - Twenty Years of Talking Tabla\n        \n\nwith Trilok Gurtu and Dominique Piazza\n\n\t1992 - Que Alegria\n        \n\nwith Trilok Gurtu and Kai Eckhardt\n\n\t1990 - Live At The Royal Festival Hall\n        \n\nwith Twice As Much\n\n\t1966-1967 - Own Up - That's All\n        \n\nwith various artists\n\n\t1990 - Mediterranean Concerto\n\t2008 - Mahavishnu Re-Defined\n        \n\nwith Wayne Shorter\n\n\t1969 - Super Nova\n\t1974 - Moto Grosso Feio\n        \n\nwith Zakir Hussain Jan Garbarek and Hariprasad Chaurasia\n\n\t1987 - Making Music\n        \n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c78c3ef700b47e80f519f8239c0bdd86157fd8a","amp;dn":"John+McLaughlin+discography+part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c78c3ef700b47e80f519f8239c0bdd86157fd8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,120,195,239,112,11,71,232,15,81,159,130,57,192,189,216,97,87,253,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
