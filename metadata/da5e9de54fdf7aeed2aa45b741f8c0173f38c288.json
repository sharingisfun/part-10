Previously known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the group has announced its intention to reestablish the caliphate and has declared its leader, the shadowy Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as the caliph.\n\nThe lightning advances the Islamic State made across Syria and Iraq in June shocked the world. But it's not just the group's military victories that have garnered attention Ã¢â‚¬â€ it's also the pace with which its members have begun to carve out a viable state.\n\nFlush with cash and US weapons seized during its advances in Iraq, the Islamic State's expansion shows no sign of slowing down. In the first week of August alone, Islamic State fighters have taken over new areas in northern Iraq, encroaching on Kurdish territory and sending Christians and other minorities fleeing as reports of massacres emerged.\n\nVICE News reporter Medyan Dairieh spent three weeks embedded with the Islamic State, gaining unprecedented access to the group in Iraq and Syria as the first and only journalist to document its inner workings. \n\n\nPart 1: The Spread Of The Caliphate\nPart 2: Grooming Children For Jihad\nPart 3: Enforcing Sharia In Raqqa\nPart 4: Christians In The Caliphate\nPart 5: Bulldozing The Border Between Syria And Iraq\n\n\nDuration: 42:31\n\nVideo Info:\n  Resolution: 1280x720\n  Codec: H264/AVC\n  Framerate: 24 fps\n  Bitrate: 2046 kbps\n\nAudio Info:\n  Codec: MPEG-4 AAC\n  Channels: stereo\n  Sample rate: 44100 Hz\n  Bitrate: 191 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5e9de54fdf7aeed2aa45b741f8c0173f38c288","amp;dn":"VICE+News+-+The+Islamic+State","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5e9de54fdf7aeed2aa45b741f8c0173f38c288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,94,157,229,79,223,122,238,210,170,69,183,65,248,192,23,63,56,194,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
