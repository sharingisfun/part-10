The sound is great and the playing \r\nis excellent. Robert is in decent voice and the band is on a roll! No Quarter \r\nand Dazed And Confused are some of the best versions ever, and he opening numbers are really powerful. The earlier shows on the tour like the New York shows were long, but the marathons were generally played at 1973 length (No Quarter never exceeding twenty minutes, Dazed never exceeding thirty). In the west coast shows Zeppelin expands the numbers to where a thirty minute No Quarter and a forty-minute Dazed And Confused are routine. More highlights include something happening onstage after Bonham's drum solo, which causes Plant to start singing lines from Max Bygraves' &quot;You're A Pink Toothbrush&quot;. This song is nothing more than Plant singing what appears to be a commercial jingle. It has only 10 seconds but it's funny!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96af6fcbdc0fc98f1469fb429bc765700d85f5ab","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.17+Seattle%2C+Washington+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96af6fcbdc0fc98f1469fb429bc765700d85f5ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,175,111,203,220,15,201,143,20,105,251,66,155,199,101,112,13,133,245,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
