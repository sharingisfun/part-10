The video is made up of all the currently known Lamb audience and pro-shot footage, with still photos bulking out the disc where there is no footage. The footage has been painstakingly studied and reassembled in the correct order and at the correct speed, and synched up to the Hogweed 5 West Palm Beach soundtrack, with really great results. It&amp;#039;s hard to put a quality rating on this one as the footage is still technically not great quality but the still pictures are of course perfect. As an amazing viewing experience, though, and a sheer labour of love, I give this an &amp;#039;A&amp;#039; for effort.\n\nnukert&amp;#039;s comments:\nPlease note that this is NOT A TRADITIONAL &quot;live in concert&quot; DVD, as noted in the comments above. So far, there is no complete live video recording of a &quot;Lamb&quot; show!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e1d1886489e73de30dea212a180997c1093d0dc","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+The+Lamb+Lies+Down+on+Broadway+-+live+bootleg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e1d1886489e73de30dea212a180997c1093d0dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,29,24,134,72,158,115,222,48,222,162,18,161,128,153,124,16,147,208,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
