They take time to reload.\n\nOn the Promenade of Santa Monica, California, a teenage girl gives sightseeing tips to a distinguished English tourist. She won't be going home tonight.\n\nIn Dyersburg, Montana, a grief-stricken son tries to make sense of the accident that killed his parents--then finds a note stuffed in his father's favorite chair. It reads, &quot;We're not dead.&quot;\n\nThree seemingly unrelated events, these are the first signs of an unimaginable network of fear that will lead one unlikely hero to a chilling confrontation with The Straw Men. No one knows who they are--or why they kill. But they must be stopped. Michael Marshall's electrifying debut novel is an instant masterpiece of modern suspense. An epic thriller for anyone who has feared that someone is watching us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5db091ab3e272abc255b52486b69d24ff2e303d","amp;dn":"The+Straw+Men+by+Michael+Marshall+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5db091ab3e272abc255b52486b69d24ff2e303d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,219,9,26,179,226,114,171,194,85,181,36,134,182,157,36,255,46,48,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
