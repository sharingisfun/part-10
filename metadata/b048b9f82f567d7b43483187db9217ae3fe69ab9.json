But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in 1982, not far from RonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to deathÃ¢â‚¬â€in a trial littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already broken life, and let a true killer go free.\n\nImpeccably researched, grippingly told, filled with eleventh-hour drama, John GrishamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first work of nonfiction reads like a page-turning legal thriller. It is a book that will terrify anyone who believes in the presumption of innocenceÃ¢â‚¬â€a book no American can afford to miss.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Innocent-Man-Murder-Injustice-Small/dp/0345532015/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347214354&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+innocent+man&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Innocent-Man-Murder-Injustice-Small/dp/0345532015/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347214354&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+innocent+man&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b048b9f82f567d7b43483187db9217ae3fe69ab9","amp;dn":"The+Innocent+Man+-+John+Grisham+%28EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b048b9f82f567d7b43483187db9217ae3fe69ab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,72,185,248,47,86,125,123,67,72,49,135,219,146,23,174,63,230,154,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
