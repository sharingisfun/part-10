He is presented with a job, an apartment - even a wife. But before long, Andreas notices that something is wrong. Andreas makes an attempt to escape the city, but he discovers there's no way out. Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a crack in a wall in his cellar. Beautiful music streams out from the crack. Maybe it leads to &quot;the other side&quot;? A new plan for escape is hatched.\n\n\n\nLanguage: Norwegian\nSubtitles: Portuguese ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e87d17951e7c80c823542c73c1e3303951971f","amp;dn":"Den+brysomme+mannen++%282006%29+DVDRip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e87d17951e7c80c823542c73c1e3303951971f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,232,125,23,149,30,124,128,200,35,84,44,115,193,227,48,57,81,151,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
