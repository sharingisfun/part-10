As usual, Sanders shifts between spiritual peace and violent outbursts in his tenor solos.  The backup group changes from track to track but often includes pianist John Hicks, bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Idris Muhammad.  Sanders really recalls his former boss John Coltrane on &quot;After the Rain&quot; (taken as a duet with pianist Joe Bonner) and a romantic &quot;Easy to Remember&quot;; other highpoints include &quot;You've Got to Have Freedom&quot; (which has Bobby McFerrin as one of the background singers) and the exotic &quot;Kazuko&quot; on which Sanders is accompanied by kato, harmonium and wind chimes. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nPharoah Sanders (Tenor Saxophone, Tambura, Bells) \nJohn Hicks (Piano) - 1,2,6-8,10 \nIdris Muhammad (Drums) - 1,2,6-8,10 \nRay Drummond (Double Bass) - 1,2,6-8,10 \nCarl Lockett (Guitar) - 1,7,9 \nEddie Henderson (Flugelhorn) - 2,6 \nYoko Ito Gates (Koto) - 3 \nPaul Arslanian (Harmonium and Wind-Chimes) - 3 \nJoe Bonner (Piano) - 4,9 \nBedria Sanders (Harmonium) - 5 \nJames Pomerantz (Sitar) - 5 \nPhil Ford (Tabla) - 5 \nBobby McFerrin (Vocals) - 6,9 \nVicki Randle (Vocals) - 6,9 \nNgoh Spencer (Vocals) - 6,9 \nDonna Dickerson (Vocals) - 6,9 \nClaudette Allen (Vocals) - 9 \nRandy Merritt (Drums) - 9 \nJoy Julks (Double Bass) - 9 \nBabatunde (Shekere, Congas) - 9 \nMark Isham (Synthesizer) - 9 \nChris Hayes (Guitar) - 10 \n\nPharoah Sanders - Journey to the One Tracks:\n01  Greetings To Idris (Pharoah Sanders) 7:32 \n02  Doktor Pitt (Pharoah Sanders) 12:17 \n03  Kazuko (Peace Child) (Pharoah Sanders) 8:11 \n04  After The Rain (John Coltrane) 5:40 \n05  Soledad (Pharoah Sanders) 5:02 \n06  You've Got To Have Freedom (Pharoah Sanders) 6:52 \n07  Yemenja (John Hicks) 5:39 \n08  Easy To Remember (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) 6:36 \n09  Think About The One (Pharoah Sanders) 4:19 \n10  Bedria (Pharoah Sanders) 10:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d06f7512a929d4da206d9790a364bc3f9e05b3","amp;dn":"Pharoah+Sanders+-+Journey+to+the+One+%281980%29+%5BJazz%5D%5BMp3+320%5D%5Bscho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d06f7512a929d4da206d9790a364bc3f9e05b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,208,111,117,18,169,41,212,218,32,109,151,144,163,100,188,63,158,5,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
