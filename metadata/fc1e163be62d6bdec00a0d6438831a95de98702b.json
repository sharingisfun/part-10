In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we doÃ¢â‚¬â€the whole world is shot through with it.\n\nMath allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does Ã¢â‚¬Å“public opinionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer?\n\nHow Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the laymanÃ¢â‚¬â€minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin ScaliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t figure out about you, and the existence of God.\n\nEllenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is Ã¢â‚¬Å“an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be Wrong will show you how.
