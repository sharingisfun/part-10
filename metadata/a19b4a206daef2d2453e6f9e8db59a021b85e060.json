These are the main social contexts that inform political and strategic developments of global and national affairs in our times. In her biweekly commentaries, Caroline B. Glick, the formidable Jerusalem Post columnist, highlights these underlying trends while analyzing events as they unfold both globally and in Israel. This extraordinary collection of her probing and eloquent work is a must read for all who care about winning the war against the multifarious forces of global jihad.\n\nAuthor: Caroline Glick\nPublisher: Gefen Publishing House\nPublication Date: April 20, 2008\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19b4a206daef2d2453e6f9e8db59a021b85e060","amp;dn":"Caroline+Glick+-+Shackled+Warrior+%5BIsrael+and+Jihad%5D+%28mobi%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19b4a206daef2d2453e6f9e8db59a021b85e060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,155,74,32,109,174,242,210,69,62,111,158,141,181,154,2,27,133,224,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
