HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s won the awards, sells out his shows, plays all the big festivals, and has recorded a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live at Billy BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TexasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ CD. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a road of steady progress since WadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2002 debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Try Not To ListenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Like with any musician, this requires some luck, but credit BowenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work ethic, talent, and the fact that he is a really good guy for most of his career success.\n\nNow, with the release of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The GivenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Bowen has made the next logical step in growing his music and signed with Nashville label BNA. His 2008 album Ã¢â‚¬Å“If We Ever Make It HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ cracked the US Country Top 30, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Billy BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ peaked at #41, without a lot of national promotion. So it only makes sense that Wade take his Texas music to the country.\n\nI always thought of Wade Bowen as too melodic a singer and too much of a cerebral songwriter to be a country music artist, but the new CD has a sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got just a little bit more country flavor. Compared to WadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous albums, the steel guitar is more prominent throughout Ã¢â‚¬Å“The GivenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. There are several songs, when I hear the lyrics and music, I say to myself, Ã¢â‚¬Å“that song could be a mainstream country hitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½You AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Got MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Say AnythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“All ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LeftÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the rock-country tune Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beat Me DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are all catchy enough to appeal to a national country audience.\n\nBut donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think for a second that Bowen is compromising his roots for the sparkly things of Nashville. I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safe to say WadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going to change who he is. As proof, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Saturday NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ already hit #1 on Texas charts. The latest single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Live Is To FlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is a song written by Texas songwriter Townes Van Zandt and features another Texas legend, Guy Clark. This song alone sends the message that Wade Bowen clearly appreciates the fan base he has in the Lone Star State.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The GivenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is undeniably a Wade Bowen CD, featuring plenty of WadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cerebral lyrics and edgy rock riffs. Bowen writes or co-writes every song but Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Live Is To FlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve listened to the progress each of his albums have made musically and lyrically over the past decade, this CD should come as no surprise to you whatsoever. Just like the artist himself, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The GivenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is high quality, unique, and will make Texas Wade Bowen fans happy.\n\nI think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safe to raise the bar and expect a new level of success for Wade Bowen with the release of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The GivenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Only time will tell just how much success, but Wade seems to have the personality, work ethic, and talent to do just about anything he sets out to accomplish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1971590d7f21a67b77760c5ee865d3f4f1d49037","amp;dn":"Wade+Bowen+-+The+Given+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1971590d7f21a67b77760c5ee865d3f4f1d49037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,113,89,13,127,33,166,123,119,118,12,94,232,101,211,244,241,212,144,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
