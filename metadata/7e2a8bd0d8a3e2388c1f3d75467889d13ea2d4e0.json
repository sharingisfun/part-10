Part pattern collection, part resource book Ysolda shares all of her tips for successful sweaters that perfectly fit your body. Each of the seven inspiring designs is modelled by Ysolda herself and by her friend Amanda Allen, showing the garment in two different sizes and helping you envision how each design will look on your own shape. 15-17 sizes are included in each pattern, ranging from a 28-60 finished bust. With so many sizes to pick from, and guidance within each pattern on how to customise the fit, it should be easy to get a great result. The extensive reference section will equip you with all of the tools you need to achieve a perfect one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2a8bd0d8a3e2388c1f3d75467889d13ea2d4e0","amp;dn":"Little+Red+in+the+City+-+Ysolda+Teague+Knitting+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2a8bd0d8a3e2388c1f3d75467889d13ea2d4e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,42,139,208,216,163,226,56,140,31,61,117,70,120,137,209,62,162,212,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
