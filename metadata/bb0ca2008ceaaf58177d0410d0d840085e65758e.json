One positive he did take from his upbringing, however, was a love of the West. He was raised in the dusty Arizona town of Glendale, stealing off to catch the latest Gene Autry film when he was not working as a horse breaker with his brother.\n\nAfter several mainstream hits during the 1950s (including &quot;Singing The Blues,&quot; simultaneously taken to No. 1 by Guy Mitchell), the renamed Robbins turned to his Western heritage for this mold-breaking, trend-setting record. Recorded in a single day with a well-drilled yet understated band, Gunfighter Ballads And Trail Songs was a homage to the Old West. Some cuts were traditional story-songs, most notably &quot;BillyThe Kid&quot; and &quot;The Strawberry Roan.&quot; What set the record apart was the quartet of Robbins-penned songs, delivered in his unmistakably tender croon. &quot;Big Iron&quot; is a wonderfully evocative piece of widescreen Western myth-spinning, informed by tales told to the young Robbins by his Texas ranger grandfather. &quot;EI Paso&quot; worked the theme into a first-person narrative, Robbins telling of how he shot cold a stranger for the love of a mysterious Mexican girl.\n\nThe recording won the first Grammy awarded to a country song; the LP from which it came set the template for the countless country concept albums that followed. Robbins went on to further successes: in the charts, sure, but also as an actor, TV host, writer (he penned a novel, The Small Man), and stock-car racing driver.\n\nTracks:\n\n01 - Marty Robbins - Big Iron.flac\n02 - Marty Robbins - A Hundred And Sixty Acres.flac\n03 - Marty Robbins - They're Hanging Me Tonight.flac\n04 - Marty Robbins - Cool Water.flac\n05 - Marty Robbins - Billy The Kid.flac\n06 - Marty Robbins - Utah Carol.flac\n07 - Marty Robbins - The Strawberry Roan.flac\n08 - Marty Robbins - The Master's Call.flac\n09 - Marty Robbins - Running Gun.flac\n10 - Marty Robbins - El Paso.flac\n11 - Marty Robbins - In The Valley.flac\n12 - Marty Robbins - The Little Green Valley.flac\n13 - Marty Robbins - The Hanging Tree.flac\n14 - Marty Robbins - Saddle Tramp.flac\n15 - Marty Robbins - El Paso (Full-Length Version).flac\n\nÃƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ripping log includedÃƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb0ca2008ceaaf58177d0410d0d840085e65758e","amp;dn":"Marty+Robbins+-+Gunfighter+Ballads+And+Trail+Songs+%5B1959%5D+%281999+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb0ca2008ceaaf58177d0410d0d840085e65758e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,12,162,0,140,234,175,88,23,125,4,16,208,216,64,8,94,101,117,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
