As a cartoonist, he has produced three regular comic book series; Yummy Fur, Underwater, and Louis Riel, and his work has been collected in four books: Ed The Happy Clown, The Playboy, I Never Liked You, and The Little Man. Throughout his career, Brown's work has been known for its diverse and unpredictable nature. His stories have ranged from the absurd surrealism of Ed the Happy Clown, to the deeply personal, understated autobiographical accounts of his youth, to, more recently, the dada-esque, linguistically-challenged oddness of Underwater. Brown has won two Harvey Awards, for Best Cartoonist and Best Graphic Album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e466c11e73223301f2471c910c27a4146e292b","amp;dn":"Chester+Brown+-+I+Never+Liked+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e466c11e73223301f2471c910c27a4146e292b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,228,102,193,30,115,34,51,1,242,71,28,145,12,39,164,20,110,41,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
