Although he is primarily associated with Pub rock and New Wave, and had numerous hits in the 1970s and early 1980s, his natural leaning has always been towards 1950s style rock and roll.\n \nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f011f4967fc7c23d03c6e6d6eafabcda193583ef","amp;dn":"Dave+Edmunds+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f011f4967fc7c23d03c6e6d6eafabcda193583ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,17,244,150,127,199,194,61,3,198,230,214,234,250,188,218,25,53,131,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
