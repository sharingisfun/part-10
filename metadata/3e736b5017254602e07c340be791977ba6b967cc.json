The film follows Jordy as he travels from one wave-rich exotic locale to another, showcasing his world-class talent -- in signature Kai Neville fashion -- with heavy doses of surf action blended with a certain element of tasteful artistic flair and set against a solid soundtrack. \n\n\n//////////////\n\n\nI have more than 60 surf films if anyone wants someone just tell me.\n\nGood Waves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e736b5017254602e07c340be791977ba6b967cc","amp;dn":"%5BSURF%5D+Bending+Colours+%28Jordy+Smith%29.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e736b5017254602e07c340be791977ba6b967cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,115,107,80,23,37,70,2,224,124,52,11,231,145,151,123,166,185,103,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
