Multi-talented singer/songwriters Ruth Moody, Nicky Mehta, and Cara Luft -- the latter left the group soon after the album's release and was replaced by Annabelle Chvostek -- formed the group in 2002 after sharing the stage as soloists at an in-store in a local record shop, and their intoxicating blend of country, Celtic, and folk has cast a spell on not only the Great White North, but much of the U.S. as well. Like Gillian Welch or Alison Krauss, they can make new songs feel traditional (&quot;Arlington&quot;) and old songs sound brand new (&quot;The Parting Glass&quot;). Their perfectly rendered harmonies swoop into choruses like a murder of crows, supplying involuntary goose bumps to even the most hardened skeptic. 40 Days is full of sparse arrangements and top-notch songwriting from all three members. Other highlights include a rousing version of the seafaring tale &quot;Saucy Sailor&quot; -- made famous by British folk-rock pioneers Steeleye Span -- Moody's beautiful title track, and Luft's rollicking (an obvious show opener) &quot;Come All You Sailors.&quot; Fans of the Dixie Chicks, June Tabor, and even Heart will find much to love here. A most infectious first record, and highly recommended. \n\n 1  One Voice  3:23 \n  2  Saucy Sailor  3:11 \n  3  Arlingtona 4:54 \n  4  Beautiful Dawn 3:21 \n  5  [Untitled] 4:27 \n  6  This Is Where  5:08 \n  7  Old Man 3:11 \n  8  Heaven When We're Home  4:24 \n  9  Ten Mile Stilts  4:51 \n  10  Come All You Sailors  4:03 \n  11  Take It Down 3:53 \n  12  Something to Hold Onto  3:42 \n  13  The Parting Glass  2:20 \n\nCD ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/the-wailin-jennys/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/the-wailin-jennys/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1793b0e688ac054c2bb3731f0b40736529a774a2","amp;dn":"The+Wailin%5C%27+Jennys...40+Days%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1793b0e688ac054c2bb3731f0b40736529a774a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,147,176,230,136,172,5,76,43,179,115,31,11,64,115,101,41,167,116,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
