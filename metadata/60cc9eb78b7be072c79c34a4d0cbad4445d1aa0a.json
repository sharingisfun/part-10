James Aitken Wylie was for many years a leading Protestant spokesman. Born in Scotland in 1808, he was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen and at St. Andrews; he entered the Original Seccession Divinity Hall, Edinburgh in 1827, and was ordained in 1831. Dr. Wylie became sub-editor of the Edinburgh Witness in 1846, and, after joining the Free Church of Scotland in 1852, edited the Free Church Record from 1852 until 1860. In 1860 he was appointed Lecturer on Popery at the Protestant Institute, a position he held until the year of his death. Aberdeen University awarded him the LL.D. in 1856. \nDr. Wylie was a prolific writer on Protestant themes. In 1851 the Evangelical Alliance awarded him first prize for his writing The Papacy, which he submitted as his entry for a competition for the best essay on Popery. \nThe writing for which Wylie is best known is his History of Protestantism which extends to nearly 2,000 pages and was first published in 1878","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60cc9eb78b7be072c79c34a4d0cbad4445d1aa0a","amp;dn":"The+Rise%2C+Progress+And+Insidious+Workings+Of+Jesuitism-JA+Wylie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60cc9eb78b7be072c79c34a4d0cbad4445d1aa0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,204,158,183,139,123,224,114,199,156,52,164,208,203,173,68,69,209,170,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
