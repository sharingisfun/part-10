He takes the reader through the vigorous selection procedure, the relentless recruit regime and then elite Second Parachute RegimentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s training in Corsica. We learn about the ethos and strict discipline of the Foreign Legion. He describes his fellow legionnaires drawn from many backgrounds and nations.\nHaving won his kepi and paratroop wings he served across Africa and the Middle East, taking part in Operation DESERT STORM (fighting Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Republican Guard), peace keeping operations in Sarajevo and Bosnia and in former French colonies such as Chad and the Central African Republic. He graphically describes the action and appalling conditions of the local population.\nAccounts of life in the modern day Foreign Legion are rare indeed and this one written by a mature and modest man makes fascinating reading.\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nAlex Lochrie has had a varied and colourful career. He has been a Police Officer, Forensic Scene of Crime Examiner, a commercial artist and a rally driver. After leaving the French Foreign Legion he started his own graphic design business. He lives at Troon, Scotland.\n===================================================================================\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n5.0 out of 5 stars Entertaining! December 21, 2009\nBy Toe Tag\nFormat:Hardcover|Verified Purchase\nIf this particular Legion book sounds familiar it's because the author once had a fascinating web page that acted as summery of this particularly fine book. I found the web page to be endlessly fascinating and this book is an expansion.\nThe book starts with the author at the bottom edge of life. Needing something to devote himself to he managed to join the French Foreign Legion at a time in life when most people are starting to think about slowing down a bit. Ironically, it turns out not only did he excelled, but may have found his true calling in life as a paratrooper.\nHe tells fascinating stories of tours of duty in Africa, wild adventures, in a Beau Geste environment. But it continues to get more interesting as he finds himself attached to CRAP in an intelligence capacity. The book. This is where things become very interesting with deployments to the middle-east as well as one of the most brutal of regions of modern Europe. You're jaw will drop when you read about his Yugoslavian experience.\nOne of the things I liked most about this particular book was the fact the author not only had a great experience in the Legion but shows that the Legion is a profoundly important part of extending international good will. From supporting young democracies, to defending the oppressed, to feeding the hungry, the Legion isn't afraid to go where others fear to tread.\nThe book is a well written, easy read that can be read in about a week. However, you'll end up thinking about it for far longer than just that brief period of time. In fact, I may have to reread this one in a few months just for fun.\nIf you enjoyed this book then you might also want to read Diary of a Legionnaire, My life in the French Foreign Legion, by Gareth Carnis, The Making of a Legionnaire: My life in the French Foreign Legion by Bill Parris and The naked Soldier, A true Story of the French Foreign Legion by Tony Sloane.\n\n4.0 out of 5 stars Tales of the Long Service Legionnaire December 28, 2010\nBy Marco Antonio Abarca\nFormat:Hardcover|Verified Purchase\nIt seems that every few years, an ex-legionnaire from the UK writes a memoir of his service in the French Foreign Legion. Invariably, they always seem to end up the elite parachute regiment and follow a remarkably similar path through the Legion. These stories begin with a psychological crisis which leads the young man into the Legion. Next, the recruit goes through a brutal training regimen and finally ends up with the prized white kepi. The stories always end with a catharsis and a new self-awareness that comes from examining the Legion experience.\nAlex Lochrie's &quot;Fighting for the French Foreign Legion&quot; departs from this well worn path. First and foremost, Lochrie is a long service Legionnaire who joins up in his late thirties. Lochrie has his psychological crisis like all the other memoirists but due to his age, his character is already pretty much formed. Unlike other Legion writers, Lochrie does not really open up. We learn about his experiences as a long service Legion NCO but the inner man remains a mystery throughout the book. There is no catharsis and little self insight.\nWhat makes &quot;Fighting for the French Foreign Legion&quot; interesting is the perspective of a man who is willing to dedicate fifteen years of his life to the Legion. Afterall, it is the long service NCO who makes up the backbone of any military organization. The other highlite of the book is Lochrie's description fo the time he spent in Sarajevo during its long siege. This is an historical event that most readers will have remembered and it is interesting to see the Legion in the role of peacekeepers.\n&quot;Fighting in teh French Foregin Legion&quot; will be of interest to people like me who like to keep up with the Legion through memoirs. However, it is not one of the &quot;classic&quot; French Foreign Legion memoirs. If you are new to the genre there are much better books by Simon Murray, Christian Jennings and Tony Sloane.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN SOME TIME!!! August 29, 2012\nBy section8kffk\nFormat:Hardcover|Verified Purchase\nThis book was well written, informational and had me totally engrossed until the last page. This man has accomplished more then most could ever dream about. Truly a true life tale similar to the Rocky movies where age is nothing but a number! Not only did this man compete against kids half his age, but he excelled and made it into the elite 2eme Rep Parachute Regiment of the legendary French Foreign Legion. I recommend this book to anyone who feels down, out, depressed or without direction because this man shows you that you can be at the very bottom and come out on top!\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Interesting perspective on the modern Legion. April 19, 2012\nBy Wayne J.\nFormat:Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase\nThe author has a very interesting background and joined relatively late in life for a Legion recruit. Background as a Policman, artist and disillusioned man approaching forty belie his phenominal success and rise in the Legion. The kind of NCO I would respect if I served with him.\nAlso pulls the tarp off of the corruption and waste inherent in cross-purposed UN actions, specifically in war torn and divided former Yugoslavia.\nThe modern Legion is polished and professional as opposed to just tough as it was depicted in other, earlier era books. Possibly France's best unit as opposed to just being her roughest bunch of rowdies.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8cd77120efd7704fcd3a996766ad0331e7708f","amp;dn":"Alex+Lochrie+-+Fighting+for+the+French+Foreign+Legion+%5B2009%5D+%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8cd77120efd7704fcd3a996766ad0331e7708f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,140,215,113,32,239,215,112,79,205,58,153,103,102,173,3,49,231,112,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
