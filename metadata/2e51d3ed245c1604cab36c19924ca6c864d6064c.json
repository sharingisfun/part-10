This is a new HQ codec, which brought stunning video quality but it probably won't be played on your old smart TV or BluRay Player. Though I played it fine with MX player on my android device.\n\nIf you want to play it on your PC, you can easily use VLC, MPC-HC, GOM Player or any other modern media player. just be sure you got the latest version of them.\nIf you have no video and only the audio is playing, try to update your player or use another one. Installing LAV Filters may help.\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the codec, check this out:\n                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is nothing you can compare with x264 releases so Don't let the size scare you. small sizes don't always mean LOW QUALITIES. This is the best you can get in this size.\n\nCheck screenshots then download it and Enjoy. You'll LOVE IT!\n\nThis is THE future!\n\n\n\n** Special thanks to all the seeders. you are all part of this :) **\n\n\n&gt;&gt; PLEASE LEAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT AUDIO/VIDEO QUALITY &lt;&lt;\n\n\n\nScreenshots:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/album/GaAnOAaac&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/album/GaAnOAaac&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSAMPLE ALSO INCLUDED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e51d3ed245c1604cab36c19924ca6c864d6064c","amp;dn":"Dawn.of.the.Planet.of.the.Apes.2014.720p.BluRay.x265.HEVC-PSA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e51d3ed245c1604cab36c19924ca6c864d6064c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,81,211,237,36,92,22,4,202,179,108,25,146,76,166,200,100,214,6,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
