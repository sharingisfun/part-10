Released in 1988, it was the first full-length example of the influential style of the MCs: the bizarre, lyrical imagery, the unexpected and unpredictable polysyllabic rhymes and the innovative sampling. Critical Beatdown was re-released in 2004, with additional tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932a67ee11dc2385375131eeb56976bee0c92fde","amp;dn":"Ultramagnetic+MCs+-+Critical+Beatdown+%282004%29+%5Bmp3-cbr-256%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932a67ee11dc2385375131eeb56976bee0c92fde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,42,103,238,17,220,35,133,55,81,49,238,181,105,118,190,224,201,47,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
