[... Released from] November 2009.\n\n &quot; Supergod is the story of what an actual superhuman arms race might be like. \n   It's a simple thing to imagine. Humans have been fashioning their own gods with \n   their own hands since the dawn of our time on Earth. We can't help ourselves. \n   Fertility figures, brazen idols, vast chalk etchings, carvings, myths and \n   legends, science fiction writers generating science fiction religions from \n   whole cloth. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not such a great leap to conceive of the builders of nuclear \n   weapons and particle accelerators turning their attention to the oldest of \n   human pursuits. Dress it up as superhuman defense, as discovering the limits of \n   the human body, as transhumanism and posthumanism. &quot;\n\n---\n\nThese are the brand-new Digital Hi-Res re-releases by Nahga-Empire, compiled into a single volume, and bookended with the traditional Minutemen scans of the (superior, IMHO) wrap covers in front and the regular covers in rear.
