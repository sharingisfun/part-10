Two centuries on, he is still revered as a prophet of the modern world, yet he is also blamed for the darkest atrocities of modern times. But no matter in what light he is cast, the short, but broad-shouldered, bearded Marx remainsÃ¢â‚¬â€as a human beingÃ¢â‚¬â€distorted on a Procrustean bed of political Ã¢â‚¬Å“isms,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ perceived through the partially distorting lens of his chief disciple, Friedrich Engels, or understood as a figure of twentieth-century totalitarian Marxist regimes. \nReturning Marx to the Victorian confines of the nineteenth century, Jonathan Sperber, one of the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ leading European historians, challenges many of our misconceptions of this political firebrand turned London ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© journalist. In this deeply humanizing portrait, Marx no longer is the Olympian soothsayer, divining the dialectical imperatives of human history, but a scholar-activist whose revolutionary Weltanschauung was closer to RobespierreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s than to those of twentieth-century Marxists.\n With unlimited access to the MEGA (the Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe, the total edition of MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and EngelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings), only recently available, Sperber juxtaposes the private man, the public agitator, and the philosopher-economist. We first see Marx as a young boy in the city of Trier, influenced by his father, Heinrich, for whom Ã¢â‚¬Å“the French Revolution and its aftermath offered an opportunity to escape the narrowly circumscribed social and political position of Jews in the society.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ For HeinrichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s generation, this worldview meant no longer being a member of the so-called Jewish nation, but for his son, the reverberations were infinitely greaterÃ¢â‚¬â€namely a life inspired by the doctrines of the Enlightenment and an implacable belief in human equality.\n Contextualizing MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal storyÃ¢â‚¬â€his rambunctious university years, his loving marriage to the devoted Jenny von Westphalen (despite an illegitimate child with the family maid), his childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic deaths, the catastrophic financial problemsÃ¢â‚¬â€within a larger historical stage, Sperber examines MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s public actions and theoretical publications against the backdrop of a European continent roiling with political and social unrest. Guided by newly translated notes, drafts, and correspondence, he highlights MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often overlooked work as a journalist; his political activities in Berlin, Paris, and London; and his crucial role in both creating and destroying the International Working MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Association. With Napoleon III, Bismarck, Adam Smith, and Charles Darwin, among others, as supporting players, Karl Marx becomes not just a biography of a man but a vibrant portrait of an infinitely complex time.\n Already hailed by Publishers Weekly as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a major work . . . likely to be the standard biography of Marx for many years,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Karl Marx promises to become the defining portrait of a towering historical figure.\n\n2013 \n672 pp\n\nshoplifters of the world unite and take over","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3c983f50b9581eebe830a44e8fbb3d9a4c2fc1","amp;dn":"Karl+Marx%3A+A+Nineteenth-Century+Life+%282013%29+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e3c983f50b9581eebe830a44e8fbb3d9a4c2fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,60,152,63,80,185,88,30,235,232,48,164,78,143,187,61,154,76,47,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
