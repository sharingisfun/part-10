The influential group -- vocalist/guitarist Matthew Pryor, guitarist/vocalist Jim Suptic, bassist Robert Pope, and drummer Ryan Pope (Robert's younger brother, who replaced Nathan Shay early on) -- debuted in 1996 with a slew of 7&quot;s, including Shorty on the Huey Proudhon label and All Stars on Doghouse Records. Both the Woodson EP and their debut full-length, Four Minute Mile, the latter recorded with Shellac's Bob Weston, were released in 1997. The well-received albums started a growing buzz around the indie rock scene, even causing the bandmembers to field offers from major labels, which they ultimately turned down. In 1998, the Get Up Kids toured extensively with bands like the Promise Ring and Jimmy Eat World and released more singles, including &quot;I'm a Loner, Dottie, a Rebel,&quot; which also appeared on their classic 1999 album, Something to Write Home About. Released through Heroes &amp; Villains/Vagrant, Something to Write Home About featured newly added keyboardist James Dewees and focused the scrappy energy of their promising debut into a visceral and intelligent collection of highly introspective and melodic songs that would go on to influence countless bands; the album garnered high critical and fan praise and made the Get Up Kids heroes of the emocore scene. \n\nAlbums:\n\nFour Minute Mile - 1997\n\nLabel: Doghouse Records\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n1. \tComing Clean    \t  2:07\n2. \tDon't Hate Me   \t  2:54\n3. \tFall Semester   \t  3:21\n4. \tStay Gold, Ponyboy        2:55\n5. \tLowercase West Thomas     1:59\n6. \tWashington Square Park    3:08\n7. \tLast Place You Look       2:31\n8. \tBetter Half   \t          3:25\n9. \tNo Love   \t\t  3:05\n10. \tShorty   \t\t  3:22\n11. \tMichele With One &quot;L&quot;      6:02\n\n\n\nSomething to Write Home About - 1999\n\nLabel: Vagrant Records\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4.5 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n1. \tHoliday   \t            3:29\n2. \tAction &amp; Action             4:05\n3. \tValentine   \t            4:19\n4. \tRed Letter Day   \t    2:56\n5. \tOut of Reach   \t            3:46\n6. \tTen Minutes   \t            3:12\n7. \tThe Company Dime   \t    4:06\n8. \tMy Apology   \t            3:24\n9. \tI'm a Loner Dottie, a Rebel 3:08\n10. \tLong Goodnight   \t    4:49\n11. \tClose to Home   \t    3:50\n12. \tI'll Catch You              4:20\n\n\n\nThe EP's (Compilation) - 2001\n\nLabel: Doghouse Records\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic Rating: 3 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\nRed Letter Day EP (1999)\n\n1.
