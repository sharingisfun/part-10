Using cards drawn from your Guild decks, you lay down rooms, monsters, traps and of course loot! Meanwhile your hero is making his own decisions on where to go and what to fight. But will he be strong enough to take on the dungeon's overlord? In between dungeon runs you manage your Guild, building new rooms to attract new classes of adventurer and to expand your decks of cards with more powerful items and events","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2fd9d8f0ceac2ecf6223477e4c331c4ad70cab","amp;dn":"Guild+of+Dungeoneering+-+Update+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2fd9d8f0ceac2ecf6223477e4c331c4ad70cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,47,217,216,240,206,172,46,207,98,35,71,126,76,51,28,74,215,12,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
