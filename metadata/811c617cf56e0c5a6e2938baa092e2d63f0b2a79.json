The CCK was a developer's best friend, used on any Drupal project of any size. Now, the Field module builds on the strength of the CCK module, bringing new features to Drupal 7.\nThe Field module allows custom data fields to be attached to Drupal entities (content nodes, users, taxonomy vocabularies, and so on) and takes care of storing, loading, editing, and rendering field data.\n\nIn Drupal 7, you can create content types and you can add fields to any content type. You can rearrange the order in which fields are displayed and you can specify the label position and format of the field. Unlike in earlier versions, you do not need to download a separate module to add fields to a content type.\nWouldn't you like to know more about how to use this important and interesting feature?\n\nDrupal 7 Fields/CCK Beginner's Guide helps you to get started quickly and to get beyond the basics to take full advantage of the fields system. It covers the key features of Drupal 7 fields that will help you get your Drupal 7 website up and running with a step-by-step approach to building a Drupal 7 website with the new fields system.\n\nDrupal 7 Fields/CCK Beginner's Guide will show you how to create custom content types and fields, add fields to comments and vocabularies, reuse the existing fields, create Boolean and list fields, set default values to fields, add term references to content types, add file fields and image fields, create custom image styles, format fields' display for different view modes, use contributed modules to enhance the fields system, configure field-level permissions using the field-level permission module, and also to theme fields using the new Drupal 7 theme system.
