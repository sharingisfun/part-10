His father Jim Swan was a prizefighter and his older brother John Swan is also a rock singer. It was actually John who had encouraged and taught Jim how to sing as he wasn't really interested at the time. His career as both a solo performer and as the lead vocalist with the rock band Cold Chisel has made him one of the most popular and best-selling Australian music artists of all time. The combination of 14 Australian Top 40 albums for Cold Chisel and 13 charting solo albums, including nine No. 1s, gives Barnes the highest number of hit albums of any Australian artist.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nLand Of 1000 Dances\t\t \t\t\t\t\nChain Of Fools\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat Becomes Of The Broken Hearted\t\t\nTo Love Somebody\t\t\t\t\t\t\n634 5789\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAin't To Proud To Beg\t\t\t\t\t\t\nI Put A Spell On You\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMoney\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHold On, I'm Coming\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDancing In The Street\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAll The Young Dudes\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRespect\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRip It Up\t\t\t\t\t\t\nI'll Go Crazy\t\t\t\t\nWho's Making Love\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIs This Love\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHound Dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abd6fd37e6470f94ec5c1a6d230c89f5c8a6c91a","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Barnes+-+Soul+Deeper+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abd6fd37e6470f94ec5c1a6d230c89f5c8a6c91a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,214,253,55,230,71,15,148,236,92,26,109,35,12,137,245,200,166,201,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
