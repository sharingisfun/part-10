In the decades since, the Star Wars Saga has become a phenomenon impacting cultures across the globe.\n\n Just as George Lucas drew upon the work of N. C. Wyeth and Norman Rockwell for his own visual inspiration, he has now invited more than 100 well-known and promising artists to draw upon the entire Star Wars galaxy for inspiration. Star Wars: Visions collects these magnificent artworks for the first time. Featuring pieces by renowned artists such as Amano, Allan R. Banks, Harley Brown, Gary Carter, James Christensen, Michael Coleman, Kinuko Craft, Jim Dietz, Phillipe Druillet, Donato Giancola, Ann Hanson, H. R. Giger, Daniel Greene, Ron Kleeman, Arantzazu Martinez, Syd Mead, Moebius, Paul Oxborough, Alex Ross, Anthony J. Ryder, Dolfi Stoki, William Stout, Dan Thompson, Julie Bell and Boris Vallejo, Scott Waddell, and Jamie Wyeth, Star Wars: Visions is a breakthrough tribute to the worldwide inspiration that is Star Wars.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - The Hidden | (Richard Sala) [GN]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9122756&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9122756&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - Lazerhawk - Redline (2010) [320kbps]:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9100669&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9100669&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! ** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7384992bfaeab1c4152872c7fe3aa5a4d0ac127","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Art+-+Visions+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7384992bfaeab1c4152872c7fe3aa5a4d0ac127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,56,73,146,191,174,171,28,65,82,135,44,127,227,170,90,77,10,193,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
