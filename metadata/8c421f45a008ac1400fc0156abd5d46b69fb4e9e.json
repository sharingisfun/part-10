For six months, the world?s major leaders?including Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States, David Lloyd George, prime minister of Great Britain, and Georges Clemenceau, prime minister of France?met to discuss the peace settlements which were to end World War One. They faced huge issues and, as the weeks went by, their agenda grew. Because Paris saw such a concentration of power, the world?s problems came before it and petitioners for political, social, and economic causes came to get a hearing.\n\nThe Peace Conference dealt with, among other things, winding up the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, punishing Germany, creating Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Iraq, setting up the League of Nations and the International Labour Organization, regulating international waterways and aviation, and feeding refugees. A great war had just ended and political and social structures were collapsing in parts of Europe and the Middle East. New borders had to be established. The peacemakers in Paris worked under great pressures, from their own public opinions and from the forces of revolutionary communism which had been set off by the Russian revolution of 1917 and ethnic nationalism. They made many decisions, many of which have been criticized ever since. Some have argued that the peace settlements of 1919 led directly to the outbreak of World War Two in 1939.\n\nTo understand what happened in Paris in 1919 is to understand our century. The burial requiems for the old world were sung there and the new made its uneasy start. Much of the world we live in today is shaped by decisions made all those years ago. The Peace Conference was about many things: punishing the defeated, to begin with, and rewarding the victors. It dismembered old states and created new ones. It was about disarmament, slavery and child labour. It was about Europe but it was also about the Middle East, the South Pacific, Africa and Asia. It was the first truly global international conference. Above all it was about building a better world. Can there be a peaceful and just international order? The question is still with us today. \n\nLecture 1   The Paris Peace Conference of 1919\nLecture 2   The Peace Conference Meets in Paris\nLecture 3   New Forces in International Relations\nLecture 4   The League of Nations and Mandates\nLecture 5   Germany\nLecture 6   New Nations\nLecture 7   Poland\nLecture 8   Italy\nLecture 9   Greece and Turkey\nLecture 10   Palestine and the Jewish Homeland\nLecture 11   The Arab Middle East\nLecture 12   Germany?s Allies: Bulgaria, Austria, and Hungary\nLecture 13   The Far East\nLecture 14   The End \n\n\nProfessor Margaret MacMillan, University of Toronto\n Biography:\n\n    Margaret MacMillan is the Provost of Trinity College and Professor of History at the University of Toronto.
