And what better way to \nstrive for peace by meeting people (in this case other children) \nfrom the &quot;other side&quot; and talking to them, trying to get to know \neach other and try to understand their side, too.\n\nPlot Summary 1: What is it really like to live in Jerusalem today? \nPROMISES offers touching and surprisingly fresh insight into the Middle \nEast conflict when filmmaker B.Z. Goldberg returns to his hometown to \nsee what seven children ?Palestinian and Israeli ? think about war, \npeace and just growing up. Living within 20 minutes of each other, \nthese children are nevertheless locked in separate worlds. Through \ncandid interviews, the film explores a legacy of distrust and bitterness, \nbut signs of hope emerge when some of the children dare to cross the \ncheckpoints to meet one another. \n\nPlot Summary 2: Several Jewish and Palestinian children are followed for \nthree years and put in touch with each other, in this alternative look at \nthe Jewish-Palestinian conflict. The three filmmakers followed a group of \nseven local children between 1995 and 1998. They all have a totally \ndifferent background. These seven children tell their own story about \ngrowing up in Jerusalem. Through this portrait of their generation, we \nsee how deeprooted and almost insoluble the problems of the Middle East \nhave become. When the protagonists speak out in an epilogue a couple of \nyears later, it becomes apparent that all have lost their childlike \ninnocence.\n\nTechnical Specs (DVD Rip of main film)\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: ~950 KB/s\nVideo Resolution: 320x240\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio BitRate: 64 KB/s\nAudio Channels: 1 Ch\nRunTime: 1:42:28\nFramerate: 29.97 FPS\nPart Size: 750mb\n\nThe UPDATE videos are rips from Youtube (unconverted Flash Video)\n\nVisit http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2001/promises/thefilm.html \nfor a preview and more info/resources. \n\nOrder from:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://promisesproject.org/dist-home.html?buttonName=Order+Information&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://promisesproject.org/dist-home.html?buttonName=Order+Information&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAn Independent Television Service (ITVS) Co-presentation and \na Television Race Initiative (TRI) selection.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:495cc6617cad515c1458b45da5a02c9f1bb19fef","amp;dn":"Promises+%282001%29+Children+in+Israel+and+Palestine+%2B+Update+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"495cc6617cad515c1458b45da5a02c9f1bb19fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,92,198,97,124,173,81,92,20,88,180,93,165,160,44,159,27,177,159,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
