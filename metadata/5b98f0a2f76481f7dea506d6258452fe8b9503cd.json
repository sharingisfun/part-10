Lambert made her debut with the release of &quot;Me and Charlie Talking&quot;, the first single from her 2005 debut album Kerosene. This album, which was certified Platinum in the United States, also produced the singles &quot;Bring Me Down&quot;, &quot;Kerosene&quot;, and &quot;New Strings&quot;. All four singles were Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts.\nAfter the closure of Epic's Nashville division, Lambert was transferred to Columbia Records Nashville for her second album, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which was released in early 2007. Although the title track failed to make top 40, the next three singles (&quot;Famous in a Small Town&quot;, &quot;Gunpowder &amp; Lead&quot;, and &quot;More Like Her&quot;) were all Top 20 hits, with &quot;Gunpowder &amp; Lead&quot; becoming her first Top 10 country hit in July 2008.\nLambert is only the third country female singer in history to have three records debut at #1 on Billboard Country Albums. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b98f0a2f76481f7dea506d6258452fe8b9503cd","amp;dn":"Miranda+Lambert-Revolution-2009-country","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b98f0a2f76481f7dea506d6258452fe8b9503cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,152,240,162,247,100,129,247,222,165,6,214,37,132,82,254,139,149,3,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
