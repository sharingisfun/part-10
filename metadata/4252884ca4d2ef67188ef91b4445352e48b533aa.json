Traffic police stop them for a control but they are confused for two robbers. They manage to escape in a very strange way from this situation, but just to fall in a worse one. They run to the airport trying to take the first flight available. The couple not only succeeds to have a free flight to Miami but someone give them a bag full of million dollars. Later Rosco and Mason will understand that this time they were confused for two secret agents but it is too \nlate, now they are too deeply involved in the situation. Obviously a funny situation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085601/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085601/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Adventure | Comedy | Action\niMDB Rating: 6,7/10 from 3 292 users\nDirector: Enzo Barboni\nStarring: Terence Hill, Bud Spencer, Buffy Dee\n\n\nSource Used: Go for It 1983 BluRay 1080p DTS x264-CHD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4252884ca4d2ef67188ef91b4445352e48b533aa","amp;dn":"Go+for+It+1983+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4252884ca4d2ef67188ef91b4445352e48b533aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,82,136,76,164,210,239,103,24,142,249,27,68,69,53,46,72,181,51,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
