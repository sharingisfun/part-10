Presenting content in such a way that students develop the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills that are needed in an ever-changing technological world, the authors emphasize fundamental concepts as they progress through the five divisions of physical sciences: physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and geology. Ideal for a non-science majors course, topics are treated both descriptively and quantitatively, providing instructors the flexibility to emphasize an approach that works best for their students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e1860ca08416c79640ab05fccec4c2474770dc5","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Physical+Science+-+13th+Ed+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e1860ca08416c79640ab05fccec4c2474770dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,24,96,202,8,65,108,121,100,10,176,95,204,236,76,36,116,119,13,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
