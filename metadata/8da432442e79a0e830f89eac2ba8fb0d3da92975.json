It was a spoof of police dramas, which were numerous in the 1990s, and it was aired on BBC One.\n \nThe Detectives originated from a 5-minute sketch which first appeared on Jasper Carrott's sketch/stand-up show Canned Carrott. Because of its success, it was turned into a television series. There were a few differences from the sketch to the TV series, such as Bob Louis being married in the sketch, yet both he and Briggs are single and hopeless at romance in the series, and according to one plotline both virgins.\n \nJasper Carrott and Robert Powell play the bumbling detective constables Bob Louis and David Briggs. They were hopeless at their job, to the despair of their &quot;super&quot; Frank Cottam (played by Sewell). However, they usually ended up solving their cases and retaining their jobs, though they came close to being fired on occasion. Louis was more downbeat, whereas Briggs tried to emulate the gung-ho cops shown on TV and in film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8da432442e79a0e830f89eac2ba8fb0d3da92975","amp;dn":"The+Detectives-Season+5+Xvid+Dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8da432442e79a0e830f89eac2ba8fb0d3da92975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,164,50,68,46,121,160,232,48,248,158,172,43,168,251,13,61,169,41,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
