Bill has built a new church and got himself elected to the State Senate, but some of his loyal followers are skeptical, and the media's glare isn't helping things. It appears unlikely the family will extricate themselves from the politics at the Juniper Creek compound now that Alby Grant (Matt Ross) is in charge. The power struggles between first wife Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn), second wife Nicki (ChloÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Sevigny) and third wife Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) continue. And then there are the assorted family dramas involving the growing pains of Bill's eldest, Ben (Douglas Smith), Nicki's daughter, Cara Lynn (Cassi Thomson), their father Frank (Bruce Dern) and mother Lois (Grace Zabriskie). Bold, funny and wholly original, 'Big Love' continues to explore the evolving institution of marriaget through this typically atypical family.\n\n\nEpisode List:\n\nEpisode 1: Winter\nOriginal Air Date - 16 January 2011\nAfter restful post-election days in the wilderness, reality hits the Henricksons on their return to Salt Lake City. At Home Plus, Bill's attempts to bolster morale in the wake of his polygamist revelation fall on mostly deaf ears, and he faces an uphill battle for his political life even before the swearing-in. At home, he tries to assuage the concerns of his wives and kids, who face psychological - and physical - threats around town. To stem this growing tide of ill will, Bill decides to hold an open house for his 40,000 constituents, some of whom may actually show up. Alby returns from his desert exile with a newfound desire to &quot;purify&quot; the compound, and exact vengeance on Bill.\n\t\nEpisode 2: A Seat at the Table\nOriginal Air Date - 23 January 2011\nBill's attempt to stage a &quot;safety net&quot; meeting for polygamist leaders is hindered by Alby and Home Plus objectors. In an effort to find common ground with her mother, Barb asks Nancy to join her at a symposium focusing on mother-daughter Mormon challenges. Nicki learns the extent of Adaleen's isolation; Marge despairs over the quandary involving Ana and Goran; and Cara Lynn impresses her math teacher, and Greg.\n\t\nEpisode 3:  Certain Poor Shepherds\nOriginal Air Date- 30 January 2011\nThe Henricksons try to put on a unified face during Christmas, but are tested amidst numbing revelations from Barb, Marge and Adaleen.

Rhonda and exiled polygamist Verlan try to shake down Alby; Margene and Pam find their niche with Goji Blast and Michael Sainte; Nicki pushes for Cara Lynn's adoption; Lois learns the source of her ailment; Ben rewards Heather for her sensitivity.\n\t\nEpisode 5: The Special Relationship\nOriginal Air Date - 13 February 2011\nBill makes a deal in the Senate, but finds new obstacles to his livelihood being raised by LDS officials.

To shore up her case, she enlists ex-Mormon feminist Renee Clayton, much to her mother Nancy's chagrin. Meanwhile, Bill faces new impeachment pressure in the senate, and scrambles for new clients in the wake of LDS boycotts of his stores. With her eye on a new prize, Nicki chafes at the status quo. Margene eyes a sponsor for her pro-polygamy children's rally; Cara Lynn puts in extra hours with her tutor, Greg; Alby vows to combat Safety Net with a purification program of his own; Bud Mayberry warns Bill of an imminent threat.

Meanwhile, in the wake of a festering investigation into Bill's private life, an incredulous Barb finds herself targeted as her husband's accomplice. Nicki's &quot;rescue&quot; of a skittish compound wife complicates life at home, and lands her in hot water at Juniper Creek.
