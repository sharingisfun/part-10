However, definitions of what constitutes stress testing and how stress testing should be used have been in a state of flux since the financial crisis. \n\nWith Basel III, the DoddÃ¢â‚¬â€œFrank Act and Interagency Stress Testing guidance in the US and CRD-IV in Europe, understanding the practicalities of stress testing in light of these regulatory practices and considerations is key. Whilst these different sets of guidance and regulation bring clarity with regards to stress testing expectations, multiple approaches towards solving very similar problems have emerged. \n\nStress Testing: Approaches, Methods and Applications analyses and expounds the various approaches and highlights those most appropriate with regard to the guidance.\n\nEditors Akhtar Siddique (Office of the Comptroller of Currency) and Iftekhar Hasan (Fordham University) have assembled contributions from key figures directly involved in the measurement, regulation and application of these new stress testing practices.
