Delbert was a member of a family of four elderly brothers, working as semi-literate farmers and living together in isolation from the rest of society until William's death. A police investigation and Medical Examiner's autopsy suggested that Bill may not have died from natural causes and Delbert was arrested on charges of Second-Degree Murder. Under questioning by police, Delbert appears to have waived his rights and signed a confession, but this film suggests that he may not have been competent to do so. The film explores possible motives for the crime, from 'mercy-killing' (Bill was ill at the time) to progressively more bizarre hypotheses. It also shows how residents of the rural community of Munnsville, NY rallied to the support of one of their own residents (previously considered a social outcast), against what they felt were intrusive 'big-city' police and District Attorney tactics.            \n\nACTORS: \nDelbert Ward, Roscoe Ward, Lyman Ward, Walt Geisler, Ken Elmer, John Teeple, \n\nRELEASED: \n 9 September 1992 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103888/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103888/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 2027348146 bytes (1.89 GiB), duration: 01:44:49, avg.bitrate: 2579 kb/s\nAudio: ac3, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nAudio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 704x480, 23.98 fps(r) =&gt; 625x480 (eng)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=83539121801093396033.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=83539121801093396033.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=25393261453227457455.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=25393261453227457455.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=18350797988004872714.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=18350797988004872714.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : HANDJOB\n Movie Share ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19921f22f48aa7e7bdb07ee7b8d37e56c0ef6d0e","amp;dn":"Brothers+Keeper+1992+DVDRip+x264-HANDJOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19921f22f48aa7e7bdb07ee7b8d37e56c0ef6d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,146,31,34,244,138,167,231,189,176,126,231,184,211,126,86,192,239,109,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
