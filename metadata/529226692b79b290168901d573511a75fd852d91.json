Formed in 1976, the group consists of Bono (vocals and guitar), The Edge (guitar, keyboards, and vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums and percussion). U2's early sound was rooted in post-punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's timbrally varied guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\nU2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, U2 became a top international act. They were more successful as a touring act than they were at selling records until their 1987 album The Joshua Tree which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;.[1] Reacting to musical stagnation and criticism of their earnest image and musical direction in the late-1980s, U2 reinvented themselves with their 1991 album, Achtung Baby, and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour; they integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with varying levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour in the 2000s with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360Ã‚Â° Tour from 2009Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011 was the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history.\n\nU2 have released 12 studio albums and are among the all-time best-selling music artists, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; and has labelled them the &quot;Biggest Band in the World&quot;. Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes, including Amnesty International, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, and The Edge's Music Rising.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the subsequent War Tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in mainland Europe and the US. The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; became the tour's iconic image. \n\nU2 recorded the Under a Blood Red Sky live album and the Live at Red Rocks concert film on tour, both of which received extensive play on the radio and MTV, expanding the band's audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act. With their record deal with Island Records coming to an end, the band signed a more lucrative extension in 1984. They negotiated the return of their copyrights (so that they owned the rights to their own songs), an increase in their royalty rate, and a general improvement in terms, at the expense of a larger initial payment.\n\nBono: vocals, guitar, harmonica\n\nThe Edge: guitar, keyboards, vocals\n\nAdam Clayton: bass guitar\n\nLarry Mullen, Jr.: drums, percussion, vocals\t\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\nDVD Stats:\n\nNTSC\nMPEG2\n4:3\n720x480\nAC-3/6\nDTS/6\nEnglish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:529226692b79b290168901d573511a75fd852d91","amp;dn":"U2+-+Under+A+Blood+Red+Sky+%5B1983%5D%5B2008%5D%5BCD%2BDVD%5D%5BLive%5D%5BRE-UP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"529226692b79b290168901d573511a75fd852d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,146,38,105,43,121,178,144,22,137,1,213,115,81,26,117,253,133,45,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
