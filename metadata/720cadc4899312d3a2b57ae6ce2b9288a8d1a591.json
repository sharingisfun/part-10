Yet when sent to kill the daughter of a priest, Aaron instead risks his own life to protect her from the wrath of his guild. In doing so, he glimpses a world beyond poison, daggers, and the iron control of his father.\n\nA DANCE OF BLADES - When the son of Alyssa Gemcroft, one of the three leaders of the powerful Trifect, is believed murdered, slaughter begins anew in the streets of Veldaren. Mercenaries flood the city with one goal in mind: find and kill Aaron, now known as Haern, the King's Watcher.\n\nA DANCE OF DEATH - Haern travels south to confront a copycat killer, finding a city ruled by the corrupt, the greedy, and the dangerous. Rioters fill the streets, and the threat of war with the mysterious elves hangs over all. To stop it, Haern must confront the deadly Wraith, and the man he might become.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720cadc4899312d3a2b57ae6ce2b9288a8d1a591","amp;dn":"The+Shadowdance+Trilogy+1+-+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720cadc4899312d3a2b57ae6ce2b9288a8d1a591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,12,173,196,137,147,18,211,162,181,122,230,206,43,146,136,168,209,165,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
