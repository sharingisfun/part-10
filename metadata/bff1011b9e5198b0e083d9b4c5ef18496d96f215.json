The album has been noted for atmospheric feel, and featured guest performances by Steve Earle, Larry Mullen, Lucinda Williams and Neil Young, who wrote the title song.\n\nThough her choice of songs had always been eclectic, the album was regarded as a departure for Harris who, by the age of 48, had become something of an elder stateswoman in country music. It received almost universally positive reviews, making many critics' year-end &quot;best of&quot; lists, and pointed Harris' career in a somewhat different direction, where she would incorporate a harder, albeit plaintive edge that would single her out from the complacent, country music mainstream. As a career-redefining album, Wrecking Ball was likened to Marianne Faithfull's 1979 Broken English album and Johnny Cash's later American Recordings. Wrecking Ball won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\n&quot;Where Will I Be?&quot; [with Daniel Lanois] (Daniel Lanois) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15 \n&quot;Goodbye&quot; (Steve Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53 \n&quot;All My Tears&quot; (Julie Miller) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42 \n&quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; (Neil Young) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 \n&quot;Goin' Back to Harlan&quot; (Anna McGarrigle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51 \n&quot;Deeper Well&quot; (David Olney, Lanois, Emmylou Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19 \n&quot;Every Grain of Sand&quot; (Bob Dylan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 \n&quot;Sweet Old World&quot; (Lucinda Williams) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06 \n&quot;May This Be Love&quot; [with Daniel Lanois] (Jimi Hendrix) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45 \n&quot;Orphan Girl&quot; (Gillian Welch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15 \n&quot;Blackhawk&quot; (Daniel Lanois) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 \n&quot;Waltz Across Texas Tonight&quot; (Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nPLEASE SEED\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bff1011b9e5198b0e083d9b4c5ef18496d96f215","amp;dn":"Emmylou+Harris...Wrecking+Ball%281995%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bff1011b9e5198b0e083d9b4c5ef18496d96f215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,241,1,27,158,81,152,176,224,131,217,180,197,239,24,73,109,150,242,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
