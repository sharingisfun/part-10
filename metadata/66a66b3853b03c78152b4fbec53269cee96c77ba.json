Starting from where Modeling a Cartoon Character in Maya left off, George Maestri teaches five simple steps to creating exaggerated cartoon animation in Maya. Using the rig developed in the previous course, he shows how to animate a walk, create a jump, animate changes in facial expression and posture, animate a &quot;zip out&quot; or quick exit, and then show how to finalize and render the complete project. Throughout the course, George touches on animation principles such as squash and stretch, exaggeration, follow-through, and overlapping action.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking out the walk timing\r\n\tâ€¢\tBlocking out footsteps\r\n\tâ€¢\tAnimating the character's walk\r\n\tâ€¢\tAnimating a jump, including the landing and follow-through\r\n\tâ€¢\tBlocking out and timing poses\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating facial expressions\r\n\tâ€¢\tAnimating a quick exit\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding lights\r\n\tâ€¢\tRendering in Maya\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66a66b3853b03c78152b4fbec53269cee96c77ba","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Animating+Cartoon+Characters+in+Maya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66a66b3853b03c78152b4fbec53269cee96c77ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,166,107,56,83,176,60,120,21,43,79,190,197,50,105,206,233,108,119,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
