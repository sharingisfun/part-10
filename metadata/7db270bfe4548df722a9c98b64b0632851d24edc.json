The band, founded in 1968, overcame a generational shift in its audience and the departure of its most visible members at key points in its history to reach the end of the century as the definitive progressive rock band. Where rivals such as Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer withered away commercially after the mid-'70s, and Genesis and King Crimson altered their sounds so radically as to become unrecognizable to their original fans, Yes retained the same sound, and performed much of the same repertory that they were doing in 1971; and for their trouble, they found themselves being taken seriously a quarter of a century later. Their audience remains huge because they've always attracted younger listeners drawn to their mix of daunting virtuosity, cosmic (often mystical) lyrics, complex musical textures, and powerful yet delicate lead vocals.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\n\t\t\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Survival\n02.Time And A Word\n03.Starship Trooper: Life Seeker/Disillusion/WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rm\n04.I've Seen All Good People Your MoveAll Good People\n05.Roundabout\n06.Long Distance Runaround\n07.Soon\n08.Wonderous Stories\n09.Going For The One\n10.Owner Of A Lonely Heart\n11.Leave It\n12.Rhythm Of Love\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7db270bfe4548df722a9c98b64b0632851d24edc","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Highlights+The+Very+Best+Of+Yes+%281993%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7db270bfe4548df722a9c98b64b0632851d24edc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,178,112,191,228,84,141,247,34,169,201,139,100,176,99,40,81,210,78,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
