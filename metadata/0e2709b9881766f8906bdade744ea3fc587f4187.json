Almost immediately, things go terribly wrong: the seats in economy class on the plane are too small; the country hotel's dinner spread and bathroom fixtures leave much to be desired; and the down-to-earth O'Learys find their fellow guests are more than a little snobbish. \n\nIn this amusing and touching portrayal of a kindly and misunderstood soul, McCall Smith has created yet another memorable character who will become an instant favorite to his many fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e2709b9881766f8906bdade744ea3fc587f4187","amp;dn":"Fatty+O%27Leary%27s+Dinner+Party+-+Alexander+McCall+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e2709b9881766f8906bdade744ea3fc587f4187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,39,9,185,136,23,102,248,144,107,218,222,116,78,163,252,88,127,65,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
