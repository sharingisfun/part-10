After cutting off all ties with his uncle and going out on his own, Bell wrote a wildly successful novel, Broken Windows, which led critics to declare him to be the Ã¢â‚¬Å“voice of his new generation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAfter 15 years of failure to come up with a meaningful follow-up novel, Bell settles into teaching undergraduate writing at a small university. When he learns thast his uncle has died, Bell returns to his hometown for the funeral, suffering one mishap after another. The local townspeople are glad to see the famous homegrown talent return Ã¢â‚¬â€ at least partially because his uncle left him the familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s local paper and key property. Eager to divest himself of the newspaper and return to teaching, Bell finds himself wedged in the middle of a bitter fight over the future of the island Ã¢â‚¬â€ and face to face with the real reason behind what sent him so far from home for so long.\n\n\nCast: \n\nBarry Watson ...
