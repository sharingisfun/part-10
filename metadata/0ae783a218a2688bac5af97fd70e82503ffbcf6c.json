It gives a fictionalized account of his journey to Ireland in 1953-1954 to write a screen adaptation of the novel Moby-Dick with director John Huston. \n\nBradbury has said he wrote it after reading actress Katharine Hepburn's account of filming The African Queen with Huston in Africa. The title itself is a play on Peter Viertel's novel White Hunter, Black Heart, which is also about Huston.\n\nBradbury considers Green Shadows to be the culmination of thirty-five years of short stories, poems, and plays that were inspired by his stay in Ireland. \n\nAs with most of his previous short-story collections, including The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chronicles, many of the short stories were originally published elsewhere and modified slightly for publication in the novel.\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Soft Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae783a218a2688bac5af97fd70e82503ffbcf6c","amp;dn":"Green+Shadows%2C+White+Whale+by+Ray+Bradbury","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae783a218a2688bac5af97fd70e82503ffbcf6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,231,131,162,24,162,104,139,172,90,249,127,215,14,130,80,63,251,207,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
