Each arises from the brain's body map. New York Times science contributor Sandra Blakeslee and her son, science writer Matthew Blakeslee, begin with a quick overview of the sense of touch. According to the Blakeslees, body maps are created by the brain, using touch, to spell out the brain's experience of the body and the space around it. \n\nThese maps expand and contract to include objects such as clothing, tools or even your car. Some of the more interesting subjects the Blakeslees cover include muscle tone disorders, phantom limb sensations in amputees and the inaccurate body images associated with anorexia. Sketches and sidebars explore topics in more detail, while a glossary explains technical terms. With its breezy this is so cool style, this entertaining book will appeal to readers who prefer their science lighthearted and low-key...............\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4663b40a3b90053c5dd81bf7c05f453fa1084880","amp;dn":"The+Body+Has+a+Mind+of+Its+Own-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4663b40a3b90053c5dd81bf7c05f453fa1084880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,99,180,10,59,144,5,60,93,216,27,247,192,95,69,63,161,8,72,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
