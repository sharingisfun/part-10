The show also included filmed inserts which were mostly taken from two Monty Python specials, Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus, which had been broadcast on German television in 1972. The performance was recorded on videotape in September 1980 and transferred to film.[1] In the wake of the worldwide success of Monty Python's Life of Brian, the Pythons originally planned to release a film consisting of the two German shows redubbed and re-edited, but this proved impractical, and so Hollywood Bowl was released instead.\n\nThe film stars all six Monty Python members, with Carol Cleveland in numerous supporting roles and Neil Innes performing songs. Also present for the shows and participating as an 'extra' was Python superfan Kim 'Howard' Johnson.\n\nAlthough it mostly contains sketches from the TV show, the scripts and performers are not identical to those seen on television. The line-up also includes some sketches that predated Monty Python's Flying Circus, including the &quot;Four Yorkshiremen sketch&quot;, which dated from 1967's At Last the 1948 Show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893b461c3dcd76f6de2f2b6ac33b654d4ad097cb","amp;dn":"Monty+Python+Live+at+the+Hollywood+Bowl+%281982%29+DVD5+PAL+Multisub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893b461c3dcd76f6de2f2b6ac33b654d4ad097cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,59,70,28,61,205,118,246,222,47,43,106,195,59,101,77,74,208,151,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
