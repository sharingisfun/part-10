Speight (BH, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nAsphalt is a complex but popular civil engineering material. Design engineers must understand these complexities in order to optimize its use. Whether or not it is used to pave a busy highway, waterproof a rooftop or smooth out an airport runway, Asphalt Materials Science and Technology acquaints engineers with the issues and technologies surrounding the proper selection and uses of asphalts. With this book in hand, researchers and engineering will find a valuable guide to the production, use and environmental aspect of asphalt.\r\n\r\nCovers the Nomenclature and Terminology for Asphalt including: Performance Graded (PG) Binders, Asphalt Cement (AC), Asphalt-Rubber (A-R) Binder, Asphalt Emulsion and Cutback Asphalt\r\nIncludes Material Selection Considerations, Testing, and applications\r\nBiodegradation of Asphalt and environmental aspects of asphalt use","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a210c6c4d209c788e46a8a8e1dc68b3480a0cc4","amp;dn":"Asphalt+Materials+Science+and+Technology+-+James+G.+Speight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a210c6c4d209c788e46a8a8e1dc68b3480a0cc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,33,12,108,77,32,156,120,142,70,168,168,225,220,104,179,72,10,12,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
