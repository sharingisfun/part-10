In addition, resistances have been normalized in Multiplayer, such that monsters no longer gain extra resistance with additional players. Instead, monster base health now scales higher with number of players. \r\nLegendary - Justicar Armor Set: passive bonuses once again work with shields, in addition to melee weapons \r\nLegendary - Shroud of Dreeg Set: increased % Damage bonuses on skill proc, Secrets of the Guardian, to 300% and the Poison damage to 75 / 5s \r\nLegendary - Trozan's Ascension Set: slightly increased the damage of Falling Skies and Fallen Comet \r\nLegendary - Valdun's Rifle: Perforator Round now fires 8 projectiles in a cone, damage reduced, cooldown increased.
