Now as this demigoddess attempts to reconcile her human memories and botanical origins, she must also untangle the webs of deception and secrets that led to her murder. Beginning in the cold streets of a heartless metropolis and ending in the lavish heartland of the thriving Amazon, this book takes the reader through a journey of secrets, suffering, and self-rediscovery.\n\n---\n\nFor history's sake, Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's Black Orchid 3-issue miniseries was published by DC in late 1988, and this edition collecting it is one of the first to have carried the Vertigo logo. The character would later carry a monthly Vertigo series from 1993-1995, without Gaiman but with covers by McKean.   --STF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2a114862a704948f9612a24e2bb872c32cfc15e","amp;dn":"BLACK+ORCHID+%281991+trade%29+%28DC%29+%28HaCsA%29+NEIL+GAIMAN+DAVE+McKEAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2a114862a704948f9612a24e2bb872c32cfc15e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,161,20,134,42,112,73,72,249,97,42,36,226,187,135,44,50,207,193,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
