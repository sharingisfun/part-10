The author considers how the media might be democratized (as part of the general problem of developing more democratic institutions) in order to offer citizens broader and more meaningful participation in social and political life.\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the ''most cited living author''. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 4:03:41\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f38fac1b344b81042956847e541f593ae91f4a0","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+Necessary+Illusions+Thought+Control+in+Democratic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f38fac1b344b81042956847e541f593ae91f4a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,56,250,193,179,68,184,16,66,149,104,71,229,65,245,147,174,145,244,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
