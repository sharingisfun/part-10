But before you shrink in fear from these furry Ã¢â‚¬Å“creatures of the night,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ consider the batÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fundamental role in our ecosystem. A single brown bat can eat several thousand insects in a night. Bats also pollinate and disperse the seeds for many of the plants we love, from bananas to mangoes and figs.\n           \nBats: A World of Science and Mystery presents these fascinating nocturnal creatures in a new light. Lush, full-color photographs portray bats in flight, feeding, and mating in views that show them in exceptional detail. The photos also take the reader into the roosts of bats, from caves and mines to the tents some bats build out of leaves. A comprehensive guide to what scientists know about the world of bats, the book begins with a look at batsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ origins and evolution. The book goes on to address a host of questions related to flight, diet, habitat, reproduction, and social structure: Why do some bats live alone and others in large colonies? When do bats reproduce and care for their young? How has the ability to flyÃ¢â‚¬â€unique among mammalsÃ¢â‚¬â€influenced batsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mating behavior? A chapter on biosonar, or echolocation, takes readers through the system of high-pitched calls bats emit to navigate and catch prey. More than half of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bat species are either in decline or already considered endangered, and the book concludes with suggestions for what we can do to protect these species for future generations to benefit from and enjoy.\n\nFrom the tiny Ã¢â‚¬Å“bumblebee batÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smallest mammalÃ¢â‚¬â€to the Giant Golden-Crowned Flying Fox, whose wingspan exceeds five feet, A Battery of Bats presents a panoramic view of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most fascinating yet least-understood species.\n\nAbout the Authors\nMelville Brock Fenton is professor in and chair of the Department of Biology at the University of Western Ontario.
