It's also the group's best album to date. Besides the memorable hit &quot;Hello,&quot; there's also the beautiful &quot;Time After Time&quot; &amp; &quot;Don't You Worry,&quot; the incredibly sensual &quot;The Sun Rising,&quot; the uplifting pop of &quot;I Love You More,&quot; and the killer grooves of &quot;Wake Up Soon.&quot; \nA true &quot;feel-good&quot; album if there ever was one, the Beloved's &quot;Happiness&quot; is a gem.
