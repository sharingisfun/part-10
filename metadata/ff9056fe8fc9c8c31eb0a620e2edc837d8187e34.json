The strengths of Random Access Memories are so notable that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll forget the YouTube interviews with the collaborators, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll forget the day they announced the suits, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll forget the day the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get LuckyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ snippet leaked, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll forget every rumor, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll forget the Ã¢â‚¬Å“SNLÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ commercials. The record will remain something that draws from the past but sounds like little else right now, an album about rediscovery that's situated in the constantly-shifting present.\n\n\nRandom Access Memories Tracklist:\n\n01.
