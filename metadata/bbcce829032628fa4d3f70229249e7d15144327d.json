The\nresulting trio, however, sounded like none of its predecessors and was\ncharacterized by a unique vocal blend and a musical approach that ranged\nfrom acoustic folk to melodic pop to hard rock. Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash\nreleased in 1969, was perfectly in tune with the times, and the group\nproved an instant hit. By the time of their first tour (which included\nthe Woodstock festival), they had added Young, also a veteran of Buffalo\nSpringfield, who maintained a solo career.\n\nThe first CSNY album, DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu, was a chart-topping hit in 1970, but the\ngroup split acrimoniously after a summer tour. Four Way Street, a live\ndouble album issued after the breakup, was another number one hit. In 1974\nCSNY re-formed for a summer stadium tour without releasing a new record\nnevertheless, the compilation So Far became their third straight number\none. Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash re-formed without Young in 1977 for the album\nCSN, another giant hit. They followed with Daylight Again in 1982, but by\nthen Crosby was in the throes of drug addiction and increasing legal\nproblems. He was in jail in 1985-1986, but cleaned up and returned to\naction, with the result that CSNY reunited for only their second studio\nalbum, American Dream, in 1988.\n\nCSN followed with Live It Up in 1990, and though that album was a\ncommercial disappointment, the trio remained a popular live act; it\nembarked on a 25th anniversary tour in the summer of 1994 and released\na new album, After the Storm. The trio again reunited with Young for\n1999's Looking Forward, followed in 2000 by their CSNY2K tour.\nA DVD/CD set, CSN 2012, was filmed and recorded during a 2012 tour,\nand released that same year.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n01 - Love the One You're With [Stephen Stills] [06:16]\n02 - Wooden Ships [David Crosby, Stills, Paul Kantner] [06:37]\n03 - Immigration Man [Graham Nash] [03:38]\n04 - Helpless [Neil Young] [04:45]\n05 - Carry Me [Crosby] [04:41]\n06 - JohnnyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Garden [Stills] [05:15]\n07 - Traces [Young] [03:21]\n08 - Grave Concern [Nash] [03:18]\n09 - On the Beach [Young] [07:38]\n10 - Black Queen [Stills] [08:25]\n11 - Almost Cut My Hair [Crosby] [07:07]\n12 - Change Partners [Stills] [03:51]\n13 - The Lee Shore [Crosby] [04:48]\n14 - Only Love Can Break Your Heart [Young] [03:29]\n15 - Our House [Nash] [03:36]\n16 - Fieldworker [Nash] [03:07]\n17 - Guinevere [Crosby] [06:15]\n18 - Time After Time [Crosby] [03:49]\n19 - Prison Song [Nash] [04:01]\n20 - Long May You Run [Young] [04:13]\n21 - Goodbye Dick [Young] [01:40]\n22 - Mellow My Mind [Young] [02:33]\n23 - Old Man [Young] [04:22]\n24 - Word Game [Stills] [06:16]\n25 - Myth of Sisyphus [Stills, Kenny Passarelli] [04:44]\n26 - Blackbird [John Lennon, Paul McCartney] [02:49]\n27 - Love Art Blues [Young] [02:57]\n28 - Hawaiian Sunrise [Young] [02:57]\n29 - Teach Your Children [Nash] [03:16]\n30 - Suite: Judy Blue Eyes [Stills] [09:24]\n31 - DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu [Crosby] [08:30]\n32 - My Angel [Stills] [04:35]\n33 - Pre-Road Downs [Nash] [03:30]\n34 - Don't Be Denied [Young] [06:40]\n35 - Revolution Blues [Young] [04:21]\n36 - Military Madness [Nash] [05:04]\n37 - Long Time Gone [Crosby] [06:05]\n38 - Pushed It Over the End [Young] [07:52]\n39 - Chicago [Nash] [04:43]\n40 - Ohio [Young] [06:00]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: CSNY\nGenre: Rock / folk rock\nAlbum Release Year: Blu-ray 2014\nLabel: Rhino\nBarcode: B00KMEN7UE\nNumber of Tracks: 40\nTotal Duration: 3:16:30.220 (565 930 571 samples)\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: flac\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 725 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz  \n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original Blu-ray Release M2TS\nConverter: DVD Audio Extractor\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within MP3 Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: MD5, FFP, foo_dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 1.00 GB (1,077,525,897 bytes)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebay.net/1461798&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebay.net/1461798&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbcce829032628fa4d3f70229249e7d15144327d","amp;dn":"CSNY+-+CSNY+1974+%5B2014%5D+%5BFLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbcce829032628fa4d3f70229249e7d15144327d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,204,232,41,3,38,40,250,77,63,112,34,146,73,231,209,81,68,50,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
