She can only do so much with the 1Gbps NIC\n\nSpeaking of Plex, it's going to get the episode names wrong. The FILE names are correct. Believe those. Check IMDB. Plex has weird, but not horrible names for each episode. IDFK why. Some are right, most are wrong. You'll have to change them manually. Unless my changes effect yours. I changed them and that might propagate back to the main database idfk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9872d518e6583203ded352fb04795a2cff3e0d4e","amp;dn":"Single+by+30+-+Season+1+Complete+-+WebDL+-+HEVC+h.265+-+2160p+4k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9872d518e6583203ded352fb04795a2cff3e0d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,114,213,24,230,88,50,3,222,211,82,251,4,121,90,44,255,62,13,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
