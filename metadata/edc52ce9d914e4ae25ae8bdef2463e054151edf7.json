In his latest, thrilling foray into the future, he envisions an eventÃ¢â‚¬â€the Ã¢â‚¬Å“singularityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€in which technological change becomes so rapid and so profound that our bodies and brains will merge with our machines.\nThe Singularity Is Near portrays what life will be like after this eventÃ¢â‚¬â€a human-machine civilization where our experiences shift from real reality to virtual reality and where our intelligence becomes nonbiological and trillions of times more powerful than unaided human intelligence. In practical terms, this means that human aging and pollution will be reversed, world hunger will be solved, and our bodies and environment transformed by nanotechnology to overcome the limitations of biology, including death.\n\nWe will be able to create virtually any physical product just from information, resulting in radical wealth creation. In addition to outlining these fantastic changes, Kurzweil also considers their social and philosophical ramifications. With its radical but optimistic view of the course of human development, The Singularity Is Near is certain to be one of the most widely discussed and provocative books of 2005.\n\n\nThis is a 3 part audiobook in MP3 form.\n\n*DRM Ripped and converted to mp3 with Aimersoft Converter Ultimate.*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc52ce9d914e4ae25ae8bdef2463e054151edf7","amp;dn":"The+Singularity+is+Near+Audiobook+-+Ray+Kurzweil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edc52ce9d914e4ae25ae8bdef2463e054151edf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,197,44,233,217,20,228,174,37,174,139,222,242,70,62,5,65,81,237,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
