Sure, they drink away their problems, they might even have frequent domestics but down on the block it's all for one and one for all. \nHousos follows the adventures of the residents of the Sunnyvale Housing Commission in Ã¢â‚¬Ëœevery-townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Australia. They battle cops and they scam Centrelink, they even have the occasional threesome and swingers party, but once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re down with the crew in the hood it's &quot;Sunnyvale for life&quot;.\nFact of life; Australia is getting dumber, less educated - and at the bottom of the barrel you'll find the fully sick adventures of the residents from Sunnyvale... What does it mean to be a houso? It means that life is far from easy. What do you do if ambulances won't come into your area because kids throw rocks at them? Hmmm, maybe you should steal a fire truck and get to the hospital that way? What do you do if your dad owes thousands to the bikies and your boyfriend needs bail money? Maybe importing shifty boogie boards could solve all your problems. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funny how much work they put into actually avoiding real work. \nFrom the creator of Ã¢â‚¬ËœFat PizzaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSwift and Shift CouriersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Pauly Fenech, the assassin of political correctness, does to bogans what Kath and Kim did to lower, middle class Australia. Housos is a fashion statement from AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dodgiest suburbs; thongs, hoodies and Ugg boots will transport you to a world where self-medicating, poorly educated stooges are not only the norm theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fact of life. They may be trashy but they are literally as thick as thieves. With the best of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœFat PizzaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSwift and Shift CouriersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ensemble Ã¢â‚¬ËœHousosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brings the real face of AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suburban underbelly to life. \n\n\nFile listing:\nHousos S01E01 - Disability.mkv\nHousos S01E02 - Pregnant.mkv\nHousos S01E03 - Melbourne.mkv\nHousos S01E04 - Green Day.mkv\nHousos S01E05 - Thailand Part 1.mkv\nHousos S01E06 - Thailand Part 2.mkv\nHousos S01E07 - Foxtel.mkv\nHousos S01E08 - Uncle Doug.mkv\nHousos S01E09 - Birthday.mkv\nHousos S00E01 - DVD Extras.mkv\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                         : Matroska\nFormat version                 : Version 2\nFile size                      : 367 MiB\nDuration                       : 25mn 6s\nOverall bit rate               : 2 042 Kbps\nWriting application            : Lavf52.104.0\nWriting library                : Lavf52.104.0\n\nVideo\nID                             : 1\nFormat                         : AVC\nFormat/Info                    : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                 : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0a476b63644a4639243a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC         : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames      : 2 frames\nCodec ID                       : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                       : 25mn 6s\nBit rate                       : 1 799 Kbps\nWidth                          : 720 pixels\nHeight                         : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                : Constant\nFrame rate                     : 25.000 fps\nStandard                       : PAL\nColor space                    : YUV\nChroma subsampling             : 4:2:0\nBit depth                      : 8 bits\nScan type                      : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)             : 0.174\nStream size                    : 313 MiB (85%)\nWriting library                : x264 core 100\nLanguage                       : English\nDefault                        : Yes\nForced                         : No\n\nAudio\nID                             : 2\nFormat                         : AC-3\nFormat/Info                    : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                 : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness    : Big\nCodec ID                       : A_AC3\nDuration                       : 25mn 6s\nBit rate mode                  : Constant\nBit rate                       : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                     : 2 channels\nChannel positions              : Front: L R\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                      : 16 bits\nCompression mode               : Lossy\nStream size                    : 46.0 MiB (13%)\nLanguage                       : English\nDefault                        : Yes\nForced                         : No\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57b1d9a1bf862ac565502f6bdcde70569db938c3","amp;dn":"Housos+-+Season+1+-+High+DVD+resolution+with+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57b1d9a1bf862ac565502f6bdcde70569db938c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,177,217,161,191,134,42,197,101,80,47,107,220,222,112,86,157,185,56,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
