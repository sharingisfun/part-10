In Digital Archaeology, expert practitioner Michael Graves has written the most thorough, realistic, and up-to-date guide to the principles and techniques of modern digital forensics.\nGraves begins by providing a solid understanding of the legal underpinnings of and critical laws affecting computer forensics, including key principles of evidence and case law. Next, he explains how to systematically and thoroughly investigate computer systems to unearth crimes or other misbehavior, and back it up with evidence that will stand up in court.\nDrawing on the analogy of archaeological research, Graves explains each key tool and method investigators use to reliably uncover hidden information in digital systems. His detailed demonstrations often include the actual syntax of command-line utilities. Along the way, he presents exclusive coverage of facilities management, a full chapter on the crucial topic of first response to a digital crime scene, and up-to-the-minute coverage of investigating evidence in the cloud.\nGraves concludes by presenting coverage of important professional and business issues associated with building a career in digital forensics, including current licensing and certification requirements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27c6a3924d47a4e3553d753b7f96529b3b5ba4b7","amp;dn":"Digital+Archaeology+The+Art+and+Science+of+Digital+Forensics+by+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27c6a3924d47a4e3553d753b7f96529b3b5ba4b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,198,163,146,77,71,164,227,85,61,117,59,127,150,82,155,59,91,164,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
