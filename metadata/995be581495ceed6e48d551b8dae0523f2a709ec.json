While many groups would find such a change challenging, it actually suits THITH's strengths far better than their first full-length did. Their previous rock trappings are by and large gone, and when they do appear - as on the dramatic opening track, &quot;Empty Stations&quot; - they're tempered with a more sophisticated aesthetic that makes them part of the whole rather than the focus. Red Night's production and arrangements are gorgeous, with fascinating details that don't overwhelm the actual songs: &quot;Recognise&quot; is built on soft, shadowy layers of electronics that gently pull listeners closer to Eleanore Everdell's whispery vocals. Her singing is allowed to be purely beautiful on Red Night. While some of Red Night's songs might still be a little too insular for their own good, the album still finds the Hundred in the Hands coming into their own and expanding their identity at the same time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995be581495ceed6e48d551b8dae0523f2a709ec","amp;dn":"The+Hundred+in+the+Hands+-+Red+Night+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995be581495ceed6e48d551b8dae0523f2a709ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,91,229,129,73,92,238,214,228,141,85,27,141,174,5,35,242,167,9,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
