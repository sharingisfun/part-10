Following a trail of police records, FBI files, cancer statistics, and medical journals, this revealing book presents evidence of a web of medical secret-keeping that began with the handling of evidence in the JFK assassination and continued apace, sweeping doctors into coverups of cancer outbreaks, contaminated polio vaccine, the arrival of the AIDS virus, and biological weapon research using infected monkeys.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nEdward T. Haslam was raised in New Orleans and is a graduate of Tulane University. His advertising career took him to Detroit where he managed advertising for some of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest corporations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76814e4b06185eb39b9ad4ed1d3089811377a289","amp;dn":"Dr.+Mary%27s+Monkey+-+Edward+T.+Haslam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76814e4b06185eb39b9ad4ed1d3089811377a289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,129,78,75,6,24,94,179,155,154,212,237,29,48,137,129,19,119,162,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
