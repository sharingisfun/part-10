But Waller made an indelible enough impression for Satchmo to record \nthe tribute album Satch Plays Fats: The Music of Fats Waller in 1955 when such \nideas were new. The original nine-track lineup forms the centerpiece of the \nreissue, with Armstrong ably supported by his All-Stars on such classics as \n&quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; &quot;Squeeze Me,&quot; and &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'.&quot; But this reissue \ndelivers over twice the tracks of the original LP issue, with four edited \nalternate takes from the same session, plus seven more tracks of Waller material \nrecorded by Armstrong in the 1920s and '30s. The mid-'50s was a fertile time for \nArmstrong and coupled with the '20s and '30s bonus tracks, this makes for a \nstellar overall package.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and expecting a\nrelease, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and expressing this is\nlegitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+\npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading\nand therefore, sharing. But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself,\nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused\ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING\nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT. This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent\nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e493e4919ec3947d089dbc26256466ea82a4b6e","amp;dn":"Louis+Armstrong+-+Satch+Plays+Fats+%28The+Music+of+Fats+Waller%29+%5BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e493e4919ec3947d089dbc26256466ea82a4b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,73,62,73,25,236,57,71,208,137,219,194,98,86,70,110,168,42,75,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
