It has also become the epicenter of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadly health epidemic, HIV/AIDS, and one of the battlegrounds in the fight against terrorism. With Nigeria and South Africa leading the continent, Africa has become a major player to be reckoned with in the global affairs.\n\n\n\nReview\n&quot;A detailed account of Africa in global politics with a special emphasis on its numerous problems and suggestions for resolution. The analysis is rich in its treatment of subregional and continental organizations such as the Southern African Development Community, for example. There is an equally detailed analysis of the role that Nigeria played in liberating South Africa from the racist apartheid in South Africa... the author offers a number of very useful suggestions for African progress and development...
