To his beautiful secretary-mistress, he was a god-like hero to be served with her mind, soul and body. \n\nTo his aristocratic young wife, he was an elemental force of nature to be tamed. To his millionaire father-in-law, he was a giant whose single error could be used to destroy him. What kind of man was Bjorn Faulkner? \n\nOnly you, the reader, can decide. On one level, Night of January 16th is a totally gripping drama about the rise and destruction of a brilliant and ruthless man. On a deeper level, it is a superb dramatic objectification of Ayn Rand's vision of human strength and weakness. Since its original Broadway success, it has achieved vast worldwide popularity and acclaim.\n\nGenre: Fiction | Literature ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91f4d992849828b27f6a62b0b4ce3dea77fc5584","amp;dn":"Night+of+January+16th+by+Ayn+Rand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91f4d992849828b27f6a62b0b4ce3dea77fc5584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,244,217,146,132,152,40,178,127,106,98,176,180,206,61,234,119,252,85,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
