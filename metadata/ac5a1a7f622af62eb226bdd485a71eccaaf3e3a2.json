And no you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t borrow our shrinking ray.\n\nAttack of the Puppet People tells the story of such a madman, and the unfortunate woman who stumbles across his scheme while working as a secretary at his doll factory. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, he makes dolls, and turns people into dolls, and dolls are probably found in a section of the toy store close to puppets, hence: Attack of the Puppet People. There is a puppet show in the movie, but it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a result of the madman. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the result of another madman, it supposedly played on Broadway, and you will not believe your eyes when you see it.\n\nJoin Mike, Kevin, and Bill for Attack of the Puppet People, classic 60s B movie cheese that is almost as scary as that Roberto Benigni version of Pinocchio!\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRiffTrax are comedy audio commentaries of Hollywood movies, television programs and films featuring Mystery Science Theater 3000 comedians Michael J.
