This upload is quite special to me, since its an artist I have been following from the start. \n\nIn honor of his one year anniversary, I am releasing all of his tracks for download!\n\nArchie is becoming a massive banger in the club scene, and I hope he gets out there a lot in the upcoming years.\n\nThis pack contains every single one of his unreleased/EP/remix/single releases to date, as well as his early Brony work, which he deleted from his youtube channel a while back. \n\nIf you love these tracks, be sure to support him by buying future releases!\n\n(NOTE: For some tracks, the album artwork shows another man in shades by the name of Archie. However, he is not THIS Archie. Don't get confused! :P)\n\nHope you guys enjoy. Send a like on Facebook or a follow on Twitter if you do!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db930a3d5bcfc74e45e76ed74bb4db667a064bf","amp;dn":"Archie+%281+Year+Anniversary+FULL+DISCOGRAPHY%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db930a3d5bcfc74e45e76ed74bb4db667a064bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,185,48,163,213,188,252,116,228,94,118,237,116,187,77,182,103,160,100,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
