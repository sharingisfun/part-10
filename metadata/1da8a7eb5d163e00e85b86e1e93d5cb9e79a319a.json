Our approach combines process simulation, multi-objective optimization tools (MOO), economic analysis, life cycle assessment (LCA) and decision support systems (DSS). The developed strategy will be used to solve very complex problems. For that it will be necessary to develop new algorithms and decomposition strategies to divide the original problem in more manageable sub-problems, to obtain the optimal design of the process","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da8a7eb5d163e00e85b86e1e93d5cb9e79a319a","amp;dn":"Optimal+Design+of+Sustainable+Chemical+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da8a7eb5d163e00e85b86e1e93d5cb9e79a319a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,168,167,235,93,22,62,0,232,91,134,225,233,61,92,185,231,154,49,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
