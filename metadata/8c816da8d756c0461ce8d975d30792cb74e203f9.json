Many of these modern pioneers are cash poor, but rich in energy and creativity. &quot;Plowing with Pigs and Other Creative, Low-Budget Homesteading Solutions &quot;offers them a set of fresh ideas for achieving independence through sweat equity and the use of unconventional resources.\n\nThis highly readable and entertaining guide brings together answers to common problems faced by homesteaders young and old, urban, suburban, and rural. Traditional knowledge is combined with MacGyver-style ingenuity to create projects that maximize available resources, including:\n\n* Animal management strategies for the yard, garden, and field\n* Pole building and construction techniques from woodlot materials\n* Replacing farm machinery with homemade hand tools and implements\n* Leveraging increased self-sufficiency into a home-based business\n* Whether you are a dreamer or a doer, Plowing with Pigs will inspire, challenge, and enable you to do more with less (and have fun doing it).\n\nOscar H.
