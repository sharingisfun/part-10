Recently named the happiest nation in the world, it's the motherland of The Bridge, Borgen, and The Killing, and home to Noma, the world's best restaurant. But though we wear their jumpers and watch their thrillers, how much do we really know about the Danes themselves? Part reportage, part travelogue, How to be Danish is an attempt to fill in some of the gaps - an introduction to contemporary Danish culture that spans television, food, design, architecture, politics, and race. From the set of The Killing to the chefs of Noma, via the woman who knitted *that* jumper, Patrick Kingsley takes us on a journey to the mysterious heart of Denmark.\n\n\nbork bork bork","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c89ee66308ccb7103d3623f5eadd5bcae632cff","amp;dn":"How+to+be+Danish%3A+A+Short+Journey+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c89ee66308ccb7103d3623f5eadd5bcae632cff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,137,238,102,48,140,203,113,3,211,98,63,94,173,213,188,174,99,44,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
