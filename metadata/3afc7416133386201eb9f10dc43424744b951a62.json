After taking a long hiatus from songwriting after his successful 2006 Thing a Week project (with the exceptions of &quot;Still Alive&quot; and ten songs recorded between 2007 and 2009), Coulton started production on Artificial Heart after encouragement from John Flansburgh (of They Might Be Giants), also the album's producer. Unlike much of Coulton's previous work, Artificial Heart's original lyricism is largely non-comedic and contains few references to geek culture overall, instead opting for heavy themes of betrayal, commitment, abandonment, and surrender.\n\nThe album began production after Coulton opened a few shows for They Might Be Giants in 2010. Sometime during these shows, Flansburgh suggested to Coulton that he put together a band and record an album professionally, to be produced by Flansburgh. In 2010, Coulton announced that he was about to start recording his first album in four years.\n\nArtificial Heart is a collaboration between Coulton and John Flansburgh, who encouraged Coulton to step outside the independent realm of his previous work and try many new things for the album, including recording with a full band in a professional studio. Thus, Artificial Heart is the first Coulton album to be produced by someone other than Coulton himself, the first to be recorded in a studio (owned by Flansburgh's collaborator Patrick Dillett), and the first to be written for (and recorded by) a full band. Artificial Heart is also the first Coulton album to feature guest lead vocals and a duet.\n\nArtificial Heart has become Coulton's first album to chart, placing #1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums, #26 on Billboard's Rock Albums, #16 on Billboard's Alternative Albums, and #125 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Sticking It to Myself&quot;  \tJonathan Coulton\t        2:19\n2.\t&quot;Artificial Heart&quot;  \t        Jonathan Coulton\t        2:33\n3.\t&quot;Nemeses&quot;  \t                John Roderick\t\t        3:01\n4.\t&quot;The World Belongs to You&quot;  \tJonathan Coulton\t        2:11\n5.\t&quot;Today with Your Wife&quot;  \tJonathan Coulton\t        2:57\n6.\t&quot;Sucker Punch&quot;  \t        Jonathan Coulton\t        1:42\n7.\t&quot;Glasses&quot;  \t                Jonathan Coulton\t        2:47\n8.\t&quot;Je Suis Rick Springfield&quot;  \tJonathan Coulton\t        2:28\n9.\t&quot;Alone at Home&quot;  \t        Jonathan Coulton\t        2:02\n10.\t&quot;Fraud&quot;  \t                Jonathan Coulton\t        3:00\n11.\t&quot;Good Morning Tucson&quot;  \t        Jonathan Coulton\t        2:27\n12.\t&quot;Now I Am an Arsonist&quot;          Jonathan Coulton, Suzanne Vega\t2:53\n13.\t&quot;Down Today&quot;  \t                Jonathan Coulton\t        2:22\n14.\t&quot;Dissolve&quot;  \t                Jonathan Coulton\t        2:58\n15.\t&quot;Nobody Loves You Like Me&quot;    \tJonathan Coulton         \t2:19\n16.\t&quot;Still Alive&quot;  \t                Sara Quin\t                4:15\n17.\t&quot;Want You Gone&quot;  \t        Jonathan Coulton\t        2:22\n18.\t&quot;The Stache&quot;  \t                Jonathan Coulton\t        3:00\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJonathan Coulton - Vocals, guitar\nChris Anderson   - Bass\nMarty Beller     - Drums\nMauro Refosco    - Percussion\nJoe McGinty      - Keyboards\nJon Spurney      - Keyboards\nSuzanne Vega     - Vocals on &quot;Now I Am An Arsonist&quot;\nSara Quin        - Vocals on &quot;Still Alive&quot;\nJohn Roderick    - Vocals on &quot;Nemeses&quot;\nDorit Chrysler   - Theremin on &quot;Still Alive&quot;\nStan Harrison    - Saxophone Arrangement and Performance on &quot;Sticking It To Myself&quot;\n\n\n[Text font: Wikipedia]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3afc7416133386201eb9f10dc43424744b951a62","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Coulton+-+Artificial+Heart+%5B2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3afc7416133386201eb9f10dc43424744b951a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,252,116,22,19,51,134,32,30,185,241,13,196,52,36,116,75,149,26,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
