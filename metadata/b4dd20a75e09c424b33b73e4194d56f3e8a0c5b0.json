In between these dates, we witness the siege of Louisbourg during the Seven Years' War, where Cook made his almost accidental discovery of the surveying techniques that distinguished him and gave him a prominent place in history. \n\nWe see the development of his abilities while based in Halifax (1759-62), a port he knew better than any but his home port of Whitby, England. We are also party to the detailed description of Cook's Newfoundland survey of 1763-67.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4dd20a75e09c424b33b73e4194d56f3e8a0c5b0","amp;dn":"To+go+upon+Discovery+-+James+Cook+and+Canada+1758-1779+%28History+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4dd20a75e09c424b33b73e4194d56f3e8a0c5b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,221,32,167,94,9,196,36,179,59,115,228,25,77,86,243,232,160,197,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
