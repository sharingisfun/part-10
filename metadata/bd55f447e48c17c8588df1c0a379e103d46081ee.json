They were one of the most\nsuccessful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven &quot;Second British Invasion&quot;\nof the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK\nSingles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100, and according to the Sunday Mercury,\nthey have sold more than 100 million records.\n\nWhile they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene along with bands such as\nSpandau Ballet when they first emerged, the band later shed this image. The band worked with\nfashion designers to build a sharp and elegant image that earned them the nickname\n&quot;the prettiest boys in rock.&quot; The band has won a number of awards throughout their career\nincluding two Grammy Awards, two Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€receiving the award for Outstanding Contribution\nto Music, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and were awarded a star on the\nHollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\n\nTrack List (Disc 1)\n\n01.
