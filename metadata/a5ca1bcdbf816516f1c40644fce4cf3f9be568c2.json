But, home is definitely a bit different. My best friend (the only person alive now that knows my secret) has a new boyfriend; and he has a friend. Shane Maxton: bad boy, tattooed rock god, eye candy extraordinaire. He is also New York City's most arrogant, self-serving, son of a, well, a definite one-night stand kind of a guy.\n\nBut, it doesn't matter to me because I've spent my existence looking for the love of my life, my angel. And, there is nothing that Shane Maxton can do to change that.\n\nSaving Grace (Mad World #2) by Christine Zolendz (October 5th 2012)\n\nAfter spending over 2,000 years being a lost soul looking for the angel I was forbidden to fall in love with, I finally found him. Lucky for me he has taken up residence inside the hot body of NYCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s local bad boy, tattooed rock star, Shane Maxton. Turns out, not only is he absolutely perfect, so is the whole Grace Taylor life that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m stuck in. The only problem is Gabriel. An archangel who wants me all to himself so he kind of kidnaps me. Now I have to find my way back and hope everything works outÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nScars and Songs (Mad World #3) by Christine Zolendz (June 13th 2013)\n\nShane Maxton is front man for New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular rock band, Mad World. But he has secrets; heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not what everybody thinks he is.\nHe comes from an ancient world, from a different time, when angels walked among men.\nRead the story, through ShaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes, of his forbidden love, his fall from grace and his inner turmoil from living with the irrational emotions of being human.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5ca1bcdbf816516f1c40644fce4cf3f9be568c2","amp;dn":"Mad+World+Series+%281-3%29+by+Christine+Zolendz+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5ca1bcdbf816516f1c40644fce4cf3f9be568c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,202,27,205,191,129,101,22,241,196,6,68,252,228,207,63,155,229,104,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
