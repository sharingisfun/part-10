He was asked to leave the band because of increasingly poorer vocal performances and attitude issues, NOT because he spent too much time on his side project band Six Feet Under.\n\nA common rumour regarding the original logo is that Chris Barnes, the one who drew the logo, claims to have rights to its use, and following his departure from the band, a new logo was designed. This is also why newer reissues of the albums featuring Chris Barnes often have the newer logo on them than the original logo from the albums.\n\nBecause of various complaints from teachers and parents who claimed Cannibal Corpse would be dangerous to children, the band had not been allowed to play any song from the first three albums live in Germany until the ban was officially lifted in June 2006.\n\nAlex Webster Bass (1988-present)\nPaul Mazurkiewicz Drums (1988-present)\nRob Barrett Guitars (1993-1997,2005-present)\nGeorge &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher Vocals (1995-present)\nPat O'Brien Guitars (1997-present)\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Torturing and Eviscerating Live&quot; Recorded in Tampa 2010 &amp; Milwaukee 2012\n\n\n01.
