On his first solo piano record, Brubeck not only plays quite well but introduces such new compositions as &quot;In Your Own Sweet Way&quot; and &quot;One Moment Worth Years&quot; in addition to performing a remake of &quot;The Duke.&quot; ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel: \nDave Brubeck (Piano)\n\nDave Brubeck - Brubeck Plays Brubeck Tracks:\n01  Swing Bells 3:39 \n02  Walkin' Line 2:47 \n03  In Your Own Sweet Way 5:01 \n04  Two-Part Contention 5:39 \n05  Weep No More 3:59 \n06  The Duke 2:54 \n07  When I Was Young 3:19 \n08  One Moment Worth Years 4:55 \n09  The Waltz 3:49 \nAll compositions - by Dave Brubeck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ffdefc6e05007d9b81f25e63154a5260a246ea6","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+-+Brubeck+Plays+Brubeck+%281956%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bscho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ffdefc6e05007d9b81f25e63154a5260a246ea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,253,239,198,224,80,7,217,184,31,37,230,49,84,165,38,10,36,110,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
