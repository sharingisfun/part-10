In the game, the player controls up to six characters in a wild west setting. The protagonist is a worldly knife fighter and gunslinger, John Cooper. He takes on a bounty to capture a notorious train robber named &quot;El Diablo&quot;. As Cooper sets off on his quest, he is aided by five other friends and they work together in a real-time, stealth based structure very similar to that introduced in Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, although an all-out gunfight is still highly possible in the game. A sequel called Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge was released in late March 2006. A second sequel, Helldorado, (announced as expansion pack Desperados 2: Conspiracy but made into a full game) was released in mid-2007 in Germany. The English version was released in some regions in November 2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ace1293fc4ee9f3c02bad1242a932adb5f1b907e","amp;dn":"Desperados.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ace1293fc4ee9f3c02bad1242a932adb5f1b907e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,225,41,63,196,238,159,60,2,186,209,36,42,147,42,219,95,27,144,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
