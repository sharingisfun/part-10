For the first time in its long history, this famously discreet institution has opened its doors to documentary cameras. Director Jane Treays has spent a year behind the scenes, upstairs and downstairs, following staff and their guests, some of whom are prepared to pay the price of a small family car for one night's stay. Opened in 1854, Claridge's is famed for its Art Deco interiors and traditional service. Many staff, such as Roman the doorman, have worked there for over 30 years, giving guests continuity and the sense they might be living in different century.\n\n\n\n3)  Part 3 \nIt is mid-summer madness at Claridge's, and it appears the whole world is coming through its doors. Thirty delegations from around the world are arriving for the Olympics. The red carpet is rolled out five times a day for heads of state and Noma, ranked the World's No 1 restaurant, is setting up as a pop-up in the Ballroom. With the kitchen stuffed with hay and wood sorrel, Claridge's chefs are faced with turning their back on the traditional fayre to provide Nordic foraged food to thousands of guests who have paid Ã‚Â£195 per head to sample among other delights - live ants. Bill and Laura fly in from Atlanta for the wedding of their dreams and Stephen, the butler, prepares a suite for one of the hotel's most regular guests, by bringing his furniture, hat boxes and 20 suits out of storage, all for one night's stay.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/88/insideclaridgesscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/88/insideclaridgesscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2140/insideclaridgesscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2140/insideclaridgesscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/4286/insideclaridgesscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/4286/insideclaridgesscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/3628/insideclaridgesscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/3628/insideclaridgesscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/3496/insideclaridgesscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/3496/insideclaridgesscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/4016/insideclaridgesscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/4016/insideclaridgesscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/5425/insideclaridgesscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/5425/insideclaridgesscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/8569/insideclaridgesscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/8569/insideclaridgesscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/9126/insideclaridgesscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/9126/insideclaridgesscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/5881/insideclaridgesscreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/5881/insideclaridgesscreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6994/insideclaridgesscreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6994/insideclaridgesscreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/4567/insideclaridgesscreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/4567/insideclaridgesscreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1526 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pbjfs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pbjfs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Art%20Deco%20Icons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Art%20Deco%20Icons&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f2ebd4d3db38966a399bf650e9e6ee0e345923c","amp;dn":"BBC+Inside+Claridges+3of3+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f2ebd4d3db38966a399bf650e9e6ee0e345923c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,46,189,77,61,179,137,102,163,153,191,101,14,158,110,224,227,69,146,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
