Cammie McGovern's insightful young adult debut is a heartfelt and heartbreaking story about how we can all feel lost until we find someone who loves us because of our faults, not in spite of them.\n\nBorn with cerebral palsy, Amy can't walk without a walker, talk without a voice box, or even fully control her facial expressions. Plagued by obsessive-compulsive disorder, Matthew is consumed with repeated thoughts, neurotic rituals, and crippling fear. Both in desperate need of someone to help them reach out to the world, Amy and Matthew are more alike than either ever realized.\n\nWhen Amy decides to hire student aides to help her in her senior year at Coral Hills High School, these two teens are thrust into each other's lives. As they begin to spend time with each other, what started as a blossoming friendship eventually grows into something neither expected","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed68b4e7382b3c6fde087bc34d20a64a02baad8","amp;dn":"Say+What+You+Will+-+Cammie+McGovern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed68b4e7382b3c6fde087bc34d20a64a02baad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,214,139,78,115,130,179,198,253,224,135,188,52,210,10,100,160,43,170,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
