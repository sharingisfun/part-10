Martha nurses her old father and usually gives a lift to Kyle, who works also in the night-shift cleaning a shovel factory. When the young single mother Rose is hired to work with airbrush and stencils in the factory, she is befriended by Kyle and Martha. In a Friday night, Rose hires Martha to work as babysitter of her two year old daughter Jesse and Martha finds that she is dating Kyle. Rose returns back home early after stealing Kyle's savings, and Martha witnesses Jesse's father Jake accusing Rose of stealing weed and money from his house. On the next morning, Rose is found strangled in her house and Detective Don Taylor interviews Jake, Kyle and Martha along his investigation.\n\nEnglish subtitles are included.\n\nI'm seeding only till 1:1 ratio is reached :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f84183b2d2573455638921f585f00db9e8fd91c2","amp;dn":"Bubble+%282005%29+Directed+by+Steven+Soderbergh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f84183b2d2573455638921f585f00db9e8fd91c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,65,131,178,210,87,52,85,99,137,33,245,133,240,13,185,232,253,145,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
