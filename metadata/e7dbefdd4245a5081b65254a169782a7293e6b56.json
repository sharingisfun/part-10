In The Art of Fabric Collage, designer Rosemary Eichorn uses a friendly, personal approach to show how to move beyond traditional quilting into a fascinating area she herself pioneered.\nEichorn gives readers tips on experimenting with color, design, and fabric in creating their own distinctive fabric collages. Instructions are included for a variety of surface design techniques, from free-motion stitching and soft-edge applique to continuous-strip prairie points and intriguing closures. She shows step by step how to use fabric collage to create artful vests, jackets, quilts, wall hangings, and more. Advice on how to adapt garment patterns for a variety of figure-flattering styles and construction techniques is also included.\nEichorn argues that anyone with access to a sewing machine that will accommodate free-motion sewing can learn creative fabric collage techniques. Fabric collage combines sewing, quilting, machine appliqu , and embroidery to create a unique textile piece attached to a background fabric. When washed and dried in a home washing machine/dryer, this one-of-a-kind collage blooms into a fabric that can be used as a focal point in vests, coats, jackets, etc. In this beautifully illustrated manual, Eichorn walks the reader step by step through choosing fabrics, finding design inspiration, preparing the fabrics, creating the collage, and incorporating it into garments. She pays particular attention to quality finishing techniques, including lining fabric collage garments, choosing appropriate closures, and adding tassels, prairie-point edgings, and shisha mirrors. An excellent choice for public libraries and textile collections.
