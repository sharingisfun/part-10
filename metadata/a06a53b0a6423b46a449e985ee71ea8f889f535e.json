The show was an immediate smash-hit success, causing pubs to empty on a Saturday night - astonishing, since the show went out on Thursdays. The Light Entertainment department was besieged, questions were asked in the House and Jeremy Hardy himself became known as the man responsible for the funniest show on radio since Money Box Live with Paul Lewis.&quot;\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Jeremy Hardy Speaks To The Nation.mp3\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFile size                   : 25.8 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 7s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Constant\nTotal bitrate               : 128 Kbps\nAlbum                       : Jeremy Hardy Speaks To The Nation - Series 01\nAlbum/Performer             : Jeremy Hardy\nTrack name                  : Jeremy Hardy Speaks To The Nation\nTrack position              : 1\nPerformer                   : Jeremy Hardy\nGenre                       : Comedy\nRecorded_Date               : 1993\nEncoded library             : LAME3.93\nComment                     : MP3's Recorded By Slimoo\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 11s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 44.1 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 25.8 MB (100%)\nEncoded library             : LAME3.93\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06a53b0a6423b46a449e985ee71ea8f889f535e","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Jeremy+Hardy+Speaks+To+The+Nation+-+S01+to+09+-+RadioRip+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06a53b0a6423b46a449e985ee71ea8f889f535e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,106,83,176,166,66,59,70,164,73,233,133,238,113,234,143,136,159,83,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
