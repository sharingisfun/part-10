As another reviewer opines, that fact makes this compilation the best value for the money (or otherwise).\nIt is way TOO easy to dog out disco. But it was equally incredibly easy to dance to, to the point where it is almost impossible to sit still while this music is playing. The sound was infectious, which in part is why it is so regularly sampled even by &quot;musicians&quot; of today (I hope that home-girl Luci Martin and the rest of the group get their royalties from those today who flatter by their imitation!).These are among the songs which made disco what it was. From &quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot; to &quot;I Want Your Love&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot; and of course &quot;Le Freak&quot;, this has all their best. I cannot think of another disco group which had so many number one hits.&quot;\n\n&quot;Disco got such a bad rap after its demise, and who would be surprised? Most of the mainstream hits were cheesy imitations of the Real Thing: Leo Sayer's &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancin',&quot; Rick Dees' &quot;Disco Duck&quot; and so forth. Chic, however, delivered the Real Deal, offering serious grooves and memorable basslines that would be sampled by every other rapper. This hits collection is flat-out perfect. Not only do we get the hits, but they're in their full-length, 12-inch versions. That's very important for a group that was a hit in the club scene. What's to dislike about &quot;Good Times,&quot; &quot;I Want Your Love,&quot; or &quot;Dance Dance Dance?&quot; Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers were geniuses, and Tony Thompson is one of the most overlooked drummers out there. Rock conniseurs may shake their heads in contempt, but old school dance lovers will know that Chic was one of the baddest groups around. It's time to recognize!&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
