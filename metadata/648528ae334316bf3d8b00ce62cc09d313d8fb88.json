Whether you are a beginning or advanced guitarist, you will benefit from Fred Hand's in-depth exploration of the fundamental principles of classical guitar technique. &quot;Your body and mind have an innate ability to express the music that you hear,&quot; says Hand, &quot;you only need to tap into this source.&quot; By learning the essentials of good playing, such as posture, relaxation, fingernail shaping and the correct application of the free stroke and rest stroke, you will quickly become a smoother and more efficient player. As you practice your arpeggios, scales, vibrato, trills and cross-string trills, you'll learn to apply them to beautiful classical-style pieces such as John Dowland's &quot;Lady Hunnsden's Puffe&quot; and a dance by Gaspar Sanz. Hand's own compositions, &quot;A Celtic Tale,&quot; &quot;Heartsong &quot; and &quot;Lesley's Song&quot; are perfect examples of the application of classical techniques to pieces in a contemporary setting. This is a lesson that will dramatically improve the playing of both classical musicians and fingerstyle guitarists of other tradition.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/DVD-Classical-Guitar-Technique-Musicianship-Frederic/dp/B0001WANWC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/DVD-Classical-Guitar-Technique-Musicianship-Frederic/dp/B0001WANWC&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:648528ae334316bf3d8b00ce62cc09d313d8fb88","amp;dn":"Frederic+Hand+-+Classical+Guitar+Technique+and+Musicianship+DVD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"648528ae334316bf3d8b00ce62cc09d313d8fb88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,133,40,174,51,67,22,191,61,139,0,206,98,204,9,211,19,216,251,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
