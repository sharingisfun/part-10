In fact, Shuisheng will serve Tang's capricious mistress Bijou (Gong Li), a nightclub singer whom the boss proclaimed &quot;the Queen of Shanghai.&quot; When the boy's uncle and the gang's several other members die during a rival gang's unsuccessful attempt on Tang's life, the latter retreats to a remote small island, taking both Bijou and Shuisheng with him and thinking of revenge. The film's English-language title is a little bit deceiving (the original Chinese title translates to &quot;Row, Row, Row to Grandmother's Bridge,&quot; a line in Tang's favorite song performed by Bijou), as this drama centers more on the boy's coming of age and Bijou's disillusionment than on Shanghai gang wars. \n\nGeneral           : Shanghai.Triad.1995.720p.Bluray.x264-WiKi.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 5 814 Kbps\nLength            : 4.37 GiB for 1h 47mn 40s 576ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 5 365 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 688 (1.860) at 24.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115012/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115012/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMandarin audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e24d5b21c683bf602f7f447945c352b0dd3abaf","amp;dn":"Shanghai.Triad.1995.720p.Bluray.x264-WiKi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e24d5b21c683bf602f7f447945c352b0dd3abaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,36,213,178,28,104,59,246,2,247,244,71,148,92,53,43,13,211,171,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
