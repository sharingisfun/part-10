I will be posting the rest of the episodes as well if people continue to seed after downloading.\n\nWord World was developed for television by Executive Producers Don Moody, Olexa Hewryk, and David Lipson. Moody was originally inspired by a study which found that children are likely to pay less attention to words if there is a character on screen at the same time. According to Moody, WordWorld's use of characters that physically resemble the letters that make up their names may cause children to pay more attention to words. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If children want to look at the character, then the words have to be the character,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said.\n\nThese were encoded by me, from my digital recordings off my local PBS station. If you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show. I have the entire series recorded off television, and if people keep seeding I will continue to post more episodes.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc74fe7170ab0d2dd0c073e50965e7bd8e8d35cf","amp;dn":"Word+World+%28PBS+Kids%29+Season+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc74fe7170ab0d2dd0c073e50965e7bd8e8d35cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,116,254,113,112,171,13,45,208,192,115,229,9,101,231,189,142,141,53,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
