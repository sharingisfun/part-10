This group solves impossible mysteries, fights supernatural threats and recovers powerful artifacts from around the world. Among the artifacts housed in the Library are the Ark of the Covenant, the Spear of Destiny, the Judas Chalice and Excalibur, to name a few. Only a person with special skills could be responsible for collecting and protecting these artifacts, and more importantly, for preventing them from falling into the wrong hands. For the past 10 years, Flynn Carsen has served as the Librarian. Prior to taking the job, he was a bookish nerd with 22 academic degrees and absolutely no social skills. As Librarian, however, he managed to use his extraordinary knowledge, successfully recovering ancient artifacts and, in the process, saving the world from unspeakable evil on more than one occasion. Over the last decade heâ€™s gone from bookworm to dashing swashbuckler, one of the secret heroes of the hidden world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae11b01827a959c6220c8b8cac0202b7cf54d780","amp;dn":"The.Librarians.US.S01.HDTV.X264-Scene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae11b01827a959c6220c8b8cac0202b7cf54d780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,17,176,24,39,169,89,198,34,12,139,140,172,2,2,183,207,84,215,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
