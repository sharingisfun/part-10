The True Story of People Who Answered the Ultimate Question By Po Bronson\n Publisher: Ran..dom Ho..use 2002 | 415 Pages | ISBN: 0345485920 | PDF | 3 MB\n\n\n\n In What Should I Do with My Life? Po Bronson manages to create a career book that is a page-turner. His 50 vivid profiles of people searching for &quot;their soft spot--their true calling&quot; will engage readers because Bronson is asking himself the same question. He explores his premise, that &quot;nothing is braver than people facing up to their own identity,&quot; as an anthropologist and autobiographer. He tackles thorny, nuanced issues about self-determination. Among them: paradoxes of money and meaning, authorship and destiny, brain candy and novelty versus soul food. BronsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stories, limited to professional people and complete with photos, are gems. They include a Los Angeles lawyer who became a priest, a Harvard MBA catfish farmer turned biotech executive, and a Silicon Valley real estate agent who opened a leather crafts factory in Costa Rica.\n Bronson is a gifted intuitive writer, the bestselling author of The Nudist on the Late Shift, whose thoughtful, vulnerable voice emerges as the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest strength and challenge. He describes his subjectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives along with the ways they annoy, puzzle, and worry him. He frets about meddling with his questions, yet once, memorably and appropriately, he offers a talented man a top post in his publishing company. While this creates the juiciness of his portraits, it also can make Bronson the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most memorable character and the only one whose story is not resolved. Even so, this remarkable career chronicle sets the gold standard for the worth of the examined life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e2e2ec14a28d4956f0647dc46527e0d93d7830","amp;dn":"What+Should+I+Do+with+My+Life%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e2e2ec14a28d4956f0647dc46527e0d93d7830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,226,226,236,20,162,141,73,86,240,100,125,196,101,39,224,217,61,120,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
