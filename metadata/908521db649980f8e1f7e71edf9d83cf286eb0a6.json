Cockcroft wrote the book based on his own experiences of using dice to make decisions while studying psychology.[1] The novel is noted for its subversivity, anti-psychiatry sentiments and for reflecting moods of the early 1970s. Due to its subversive nature and chapters concerned with controversial issues such as rape, murder and sexual experimentation, it was banned in several countries.[2] Upon its initial publication, the cover bore the confident subheader, &quot;Few novels can change your life. This one will&quot; and quickly became a modern cult classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:908521db649980f8e1f7e71edf9d83cf286eb0a6","amp;dn":"The+Dice+Man.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"908521db649980f8e1f7e71edf9d83cf286eb0a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,133,33,219,100,153,128,248,225,247,231,30,223,157,131,207,40,110,176,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
