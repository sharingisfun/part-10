During its long isolation New Zealand developed a distinctive fauna dominated by birds, many of which became extinct after the arrival of humans and introduced mammals.\n With a mild maritime climate, the land was mostly covered in forest.\n The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks owe much to the uplift of land and volcanic eruptions caused by the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates clashing underfoot.\n New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes; these have less autonomy than the country's long defunct provinces did.\nLanguage: English\n Run Time: 00.44.05\n Resolution: 624x352\n Video: XviD - 964Kbps\n Frame Rate: 25.000fps\n Audio: MP3 - 129Kbps\n File Size: 349MB\n Genre: Documentary\n[img]http://www.acaciabaycharters.co.nz/yahoo_site_admin2/assets/images/NZ_map.18163933.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/7342/vlcsnap2011081623h17m45.png[/img]\n[img]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/989/vlcsnap2011081623h17m40.png[/img]\n[img]http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/8550/vlcsnap2011081623h18m13.png[/img]\n[img]http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/3770/vlcsnap2011081623h18m38.png[/img]\n[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/3521/vlcsnap2011081623h18m42.png[/img]\n[img]http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/549/vlcsnap2011081623h19m54.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:754df0f4699c69b558624542e1944226736448be","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+Ultimate+Journeys+New+Zealand+HDTV+XviD+%5B+Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"754df0f4699c69b558624542e1944226736448be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,77,240,244,105,156,105,181,88,98,69,66,225,148,66,38,115,100,72,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
