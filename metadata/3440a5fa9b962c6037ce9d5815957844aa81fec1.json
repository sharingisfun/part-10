For the 1980s, it's hair metal. Of course, this is a derogatory term for any rock band that grew their hair long and played loud, aggressive, often sexist music. Only a few have stood the test of time, let alone continue their careers long after the craze comes to an end. One of these bands is Great White. In some ways, they fit the stereotype of an '80s hair metal band, but it's in what they don't that has caused them to soldier on today. Albums like 1987's ONCE BITTEN... and its sequel 1989's ...TWICE SHY are ones that don't get their due as the best of the era. Great White really could play and write music, contrary to the popular legend, and aside from Aerosmith, were the best at imitating Led Zeppelin. They even devoted an entire live album to it. In the footsteps of Zeppelin, Great White doesn't dress up their sound too much, creating a rough blend of blues and rock that doesn't contain any of the instruments to date it. While the entire album is a gem, the biggest highlights are, oddly enough, ballads like &quot;The Angel Song&quot; (lead singer Jack Russell actually does sound like Robert Plant), &quot;She Only&quot;, and &quot;House Of Broken Love&quot;. When a hair metal band did a love ballad, it often came off as sappy and mawkish. But Great White manages to sound sincere without being emasculated. But the one song that has come to define the band for all time is their cover of Ian Hunter's &quot;Once Bitten Twice Shy&quot;. Because this song was a hit, and not an original Great White song, that is probably why the band has been dismissed as just another band of its era. However, it's amazing that a band can easily make a song they didn't write sound like their own, and that's not an easy thing to do. ...TWICE SHY only has 9 songs, which average about 5 minutes each, meaning a lot of attention is paid to musicianship. I think this was necessary to prove that Great White was a band that really knew how to play. Not always a fan of long space jams, I'm willing to make a sacrifice here. When grunge came to play in the '90s, many hair metal bands were without a country, and found themselves forced into early retirement. But Great White was a band that didn't and hasn't stopped working, no matter how less of a success they become as the years go on. While ...TWICE SHY may be their finest hour, Great White is a band that deserves a closer look. And when one does that, they'll see a hair metal band with as much brains as brawn.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat White - Twice Shy\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Great White\nAlbum................: Twice Shy\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 60 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 257kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
