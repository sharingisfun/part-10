A mother and child develop a bond like no other. No matter how many kids you have, whether one or twenty, each mother-child relationship is unique.\nVision is one of the most important senses we use in learning, but it is one of the slowest senses to develop. When an infant is born, the number of colors and shapes he or she can see is limited. Researchers believe that after black and white, red is the first color a baby can see. That is followed by orange, yellow, green, and finally blue.\nThe projects presented in this book were designed with exactly this in mind. High-contrast colors and simple shapes are used to help with brain stimulation and the development of a newborn. Natural linen elements are also used to create an heirloom quality to the projects, so they can be passed down through generations. Other fun developmental tools used in the projects include squeakers and rattles for developing the sense of hearing.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/8c/01/8d6e6724271b0ac1d188c1.L._V372423209_SX200_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/8c/01/8d6e6724271b0ac1d188c1.L._V372423209_SX200_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nAs a young girl, Angela was influenced by so many talented people. While her mother taught her how to sew and encouraged all things arts and crafts related, her father taught her how to be independent and figure things out on her own. Even her grandmothers and great-grandmother influenced her with their special talents of knitting, sewing, and art. She has always enjoyed drawing, painting, and designing, however it was not until she had my own children that she was inspired to find her way back into the sewing room and discover her own style.\nWhen she is not working as a web developer, she can most likely be found in her sewing room. She finds it thrilling when she can design something new for one of her children or dÃƒÂ©cor for their home. She is often intrigued by everyday items and loves to explore different ways for how it can translate to fabric. Many of her designs and tutorials can be found on her website (www.angelayosten.com).\nMost of all, she enjoys spending time with her family and cherishing every little moment life has to offer. She feels very fortunate to have such a wonderful husband and amazing children who support her obsession to design, and encourage everything that she aspires to do.\nAngela is the Author of Stop. Go.
