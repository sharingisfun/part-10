(1982)/LOVE AND DANCING EP.\n\nIt isnt overstating the case to call the Human Leagues third album \nsynthpops SGT. PEPPER, not only did DARE! establish synthesizers as \na viable musical tool on the US charts, it redefined what people \nthought of electronic pop. \n\nNo longer did synth bands have to sound like Kraftwerk or Throbbing \nGristle. There are no guitars on DARE! but its emphatically a pop \nrecord. \n\nPhil Oakeys gruff vocals blend surprisingly well with the untrained,\ngirlish voices of new backing vocalists Susanne Sulley and \nJoanne Catherall, and the electronic melodies are expertly rendered \nby producer Martin Rushent into three-dimensional pop extravaganzas. \n\nMusically witty and unfailingly exciting, tracks like &quot;Love Action,&quot; \n&quot;Open your Heart,&quot; &quot;Sound of the Crowd&quot; and of course &quot;Don't You Want\n Me&quot; are as catchy as pop got in 1981, and darker tracks like &quot;Seconds&quot; \nand &quot;Do Or Die&quot; add depth. DARE! is a brilliant album even today.\n\n \nEditorial reviews \nrated #78 in Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums Of The Eighties survey. \n(November 1989)\nRolling Stone  \n\nRanked #69 in Q's 100 Greatest British Albums - This glorious daft \ncreation is as Northern as FA Cup Giant killing....they conquer the \nworld with a slightly wonky brand of techno that was more \nNorman Wisdom than Giorgio Moroder...\nQ  (06/01/2000)\n\nRanked #18 in NME's list of The 50 Greatest Albums Of The 80s.\nNME  (09/25/1993)\n\n4 stars out of 5 - ...A timeless pure pop fusion of deadpan heartache \nand noirish electronica...\nUncut  (11/01/2002)\n\n3 stars out of 5 - ...Tuneful and oh-so-charmingly dated pop...\nRolling Stone  (02/06/2003)\n\n\n___________\n\n1.
