The talented young songwriter seems ready to burst out into something noisier, and he gets that chance with Desaparecidos. On Read Music/Speak Spanish, the band rocks out with more of an emo edge, typified by blaring guitars and raging vocals. With fellow Omaha guitarist/songwriter Denver Dalley, bassist Landon Hedges, keyboardist Ian McElroy, and drummer Matt Baum (Baum and McElroy have toured with Bright Eyes, while Hedges plays in labelmate the Good Life), the group critiques American materialism and consumerism. Songs such as &quot;Greater Omaha&quot; and &quot;Mall of America&quot; resonate with sincerity, while Oberst's vocals quiver and scream about money and society. With such a convincing voice, there's never a time when his lyrics are less than earnest. This debut full-length was recorded in one week, which, as a result, adds to its unabashed rawness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf4ad83009125af1fb5c060d85ef1456aacbee28","amp;dn":"Desaparecidos+-+Read+Music+Speak+Spanish+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf4ad83009125af1fb5c060d85ef1456aacbee28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,74,216,48,9,18,90,241,251,92,6,13,133,239,20,86,170,203,238,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
