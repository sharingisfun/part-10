Cromwell hears that somebody has re-discovered the secret of &quot;Greek Fire&quot; and has promised to exhibit it to the King. Shardlake is charged with finding the formula, but others will stop at nothing, including murder, to stop im. At the same time, Shardlake has taken on the case of a girl who has been accused of murdering her cousin, yet refuses to speak, thus risking being pressed to death, a truly horrible fate.\n\nCan Shardlake get the girl to speak as ell as finding the secret of dark fire?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a28bd1f8f6cc5ffcd622df7b05247d3d10a663","amp;dn":"Dark+Fire+-+C+J+Sansom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a28bd1f8f6cc5ffcd622df7b05247d3d10a663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,162,139,209,248,246,204,95,252,214,34,223,123,5,36,125,61,16,166,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
