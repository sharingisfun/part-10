Heinlein AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning SF writer Michael Flynn now turns to space opera with stunningly successful results. Full of rich echoes of space opera classics from Doc Smith to Cordwainer Smith, The January Dancer tells the fateful story of an ancient pre-human artifact of great power, and the people who found it.\n\nStarting with Captain Amos January, who quickly loses it, and then the others who fought, schemed, and killed to get it, we travel around the complex, decadent, brawling, mongrelized interstellar human civilization the artifact might save or destroy. Collectors want the Dancer; pirates take it, rulers crave it, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll all kill if necessary to get it. This is a thrilling yarn of love, revolution, music, and mystery, and it ends, as all great stories do, with shock and a beginning.\n\n---\n\nUp Jim River (Spiral Arm #2) \n\nHugo Award finalist and Robert A. Heinlein Award-winning SF writer Michael Flynn returns to space opera with Up Jim River. There is a river on Dangchao Waypoint, a small world out beyond Die Bold. It is a longish river as such things go, with a multitude of bayous and rapids and waterfalls, and it runs through many a strange and hostile country. Going up it, you can lose everything.\n\nGoing up it, you can find anything. The Hound Bridget ban has vanished and her employer, the Kennel (the mysterious superspy agency of the League) has given up the search. But her daughter, the harper Mearana, has not. She enlists the scarred man, Donovan, to aid her in her search. With the reluctant assent and financial aid of the Kennel, they set forth. Bridget ban was following hints of an artifact that would Ã¢â‚¬Å“protect the League from the Confederacy for aye.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mearana is eager to follow that trail, but Donovan is reluctant, because whatever is at the end of it made a Hound disappear. What it would do to a harper and a drunk is far too easy to imagine.\n\nDonovanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind had been shattered by Those of Name, the rulers of the Confederacy, and no fewer than seven quarreling personalities now inhabit his skull. How can he hope to see her through safely? Together, they follow Bridget banÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trail to the raw worlds of the frontier, edging ever closer to the uncivilized and barbarian planets of the Wild.\n\n---\n\nIn the Lion's Mouth (Spiral Arm #3) \n\n\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big Spiral Arm, and the scarred man, Donavan buigh, has gone missing in it, upsetting the harper Mearana's plans for a reconciliation between her parents. Bridget ban, a Hound of the League, doubts that reconciliation is possible or desirable; but nonetheless has dispatched agents to investigate the disappearance. \n\nThe powerful Ravn Olafsdottr, a Shadow of the Names, slips into Clanthompson Hall to tell mother and daughter of the fate of Donovan buigh. In the Long Game between the Confederation of Central Worlds and the United League of the Periphery, Hound and Shadow are mortal enemies; yet a truce descends between them so that the Shadow may tell her tale. There is a struggle in the LionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mouth, the bureau that oversees the ShadowsÃ¢â‚¬â€a clandestine civil war of sabotage and assassination between those who would overthrow Those of Name and the loyalists who support them. And Donovan, one-time Confederal agent, has been recalled to take a key part, willingly or no","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85a8dfe5c5db6750252ca00729a0f0e14ad9397e","amp;dn":"Michael+Flynn+-+January+Dancer+%5BBook+1-3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85a8dfe5c5db6750252ca00729a0f0e14ad9397e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,168,223,229,197,219,103,80,37,44,160,7,41,160,240,225,74,217,57,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
