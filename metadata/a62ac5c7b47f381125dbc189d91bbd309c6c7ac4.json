S. Pritchett, one of our greatest short story writers, has chosen forty-one stories from nine countries written in the English language for this volume, \nproducing a collection that successfully displays the wealth and variety of an art that spans some 200 years. \nThe United States, Great Britain, and Ireland have fine traditions of short story writing that have developed from the time of Sir Walter Scott and Nathaniel Hawthorne. \nIn the twentieth century the art was perfected by Ernest Hemingway, D. H. Lawrence, W. Somerset Maugham, John Updike, and V. S. Pritchett himself. \nOther contributions in the book come from such masters as James Joyce, Mark Twain, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, Frank O'Connor, H. E. Bates, \nWilliam Trevor, and Liam O'Flaherty. Now, the collection of short story masters extends to Canadian, Indian, New Zealander, and Australian writers, \nwho show in the works included here the full range of invention and ability in a genre that continues to flourish.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62ac5c7b47f381125dbc189d91bbd309c6c7ac4","amp;dn":"The+Oxford+Book+of+Short+Stories+%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62ac5c7b47f381125dbc189d91bbd309c6c7ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,42,197,199,180,127,56,17,37,219,193,137,217,27,189,48,156,108,122,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
