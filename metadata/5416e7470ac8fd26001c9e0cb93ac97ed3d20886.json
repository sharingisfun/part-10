As evidenced with the first incantation of Fireproof, a band can work hard as an independent and release a quality product only to see it reach a relative few ears. With MCA behind them, Midwestern metalheads Pillar have re-released Fireproof with improved production and mixing and a final product as good as anything on the market. Even though the stylistic references to Limp Bizkit (&quot;Light at My Feet&quot;), P.O.D. (&quot;Fireproof&quot;), and Linkin Park (&quot;Echelon&quot;) are frequent, they strike out enough of their own turf with a rock-solid rhythm from bassist Kalel and tastefully sharp guitar licks from Noah Henson. Singer Rob Beckley carries the vocal intensity and range to match his bandmates' raw power. He's also down with the bass-heavy groove as you'll hear on &quot;Stay Up,&quot; a rapid-fire duet with rapper KJ-52. With Fireproof, Pillar rises to the forefront of today's best Christian rock bands. Isn't it funny how a new suit of clothes can make the man, or in this case, the band?\n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, May 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5416e7470ac8fd26001c9e0cb93ac97ed3d20886","amp;dn":"Pillar+-+2002+-+Fireproof","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5416e7470ac8fd26001c9e0cb93ac97ed3d20886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,22,231,71,10,200,253,38,0,28,158,12,185,58,201,126,211,210,8,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
