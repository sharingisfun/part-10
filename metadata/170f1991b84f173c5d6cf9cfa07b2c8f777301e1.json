It is a suburban situation comedy of manners, and a satire on the aspirations and tastes of the new middle class that emerged in Britain in the 1970s. The play developed in lengthy improvisations during which Mike Leigh explored the characters with the actors, but did not always reveal the incidents that would occur during the play. The production opened in April 1977 at the Hampstead Theatre, and returned after its initial run in the summer of 1977, 104 performances in all. A recording was arranged at the BBC as a Play for Today, produced by Margaret Matheson, shot at BBC Scotland, and transmitted in November 1977.\n\nCast:\n\nAlison Steadman - Beverly\nTim Stern - Laurence\nJanine Duvitski - Angela\nJohn Salthouse - Tony\nHarriet Reynolds - Susan\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour 49 minutes.\n\nPlease seed and share with others.
