It is currently hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W. \\&quot;Chuck\\&quot; Bryant, both writers at HowStuffWorks. The podcast, released every Tuesday and Thursday, educates listeners on a wide variety of topics, often using popular culture as a reference giving the podcast comedic value.\n\nEpisodes are normally around 30 minutes in length, although for more in-depth topics the show has run as long as an hour. When the show first started recording, episodes were very short, and often less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe podcast covers a variety of odd questions and topics, like How Twinkies Work, Do Zombies Exist?, How Tickling works, and How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked. These unique subjects earned them a place in Podcast Awards's Education category.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_You_Should_Know&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_You_Should_Know&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af22bfe5eb3cdc729dad1ef3b1eb3d160a430d31","amp;dn":"Stuff+You+Should+Know+Podcast+-+First+100","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af22bfe5eb3cdc729dad1ef3b1eb3d160a430d31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,34,191,229,235,60,220,114,157,173,30,243,177,235,61,22,10,67,13,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
