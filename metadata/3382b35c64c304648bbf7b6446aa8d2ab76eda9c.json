All of the S1-S5 modal logics of Lewis and Langford, among others, are \nconstructed. A matrix, or many-valued semantics, for sentential modal logic is \nformalized, and an important result that no finite matrix can characterize any \nof the standard modal logics is proven. Exercises, some of which show \nindependence results, help to develop logical skills.\n\nTable Of Contents\n\n1 Introduction\n2 The Syntax of Modal Sentential Calculi\n3 Matrix Semantics\n4 Semantics for Logical Necessity\n5 Semantics for S5\n6 Relational World Systems\n7 Quantified Modal Logic\n8 The Semantics of Quantified Modal Logic\n9 Second-Order Modal Logic\n10 Semantics of Second-Order Modal Logic\nAfterword \nBibliography \nIndex ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3382b35c64c304648bbf7b6446aa8d2ab76eda9c","amp;dn":"Modal+Logic+-+An+Introduction+to+its+Syntax+and+Semantics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3382b35c64c304648bbf7b6446aa8d2ab76eda9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,130,179,92,100,195,4,100,139,191,123,100,70,170,141,42,183,110,218,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
