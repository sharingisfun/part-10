The journey continues on to a consideration of some of London's fascinating venues, including pubs, clubs, restaurants, hotels and bars; some nice points of conduct and the author's reflections on such things as feminine wiles (what women really look for) and even how to stop a fight. \n\nThere is a chapter on selecting and buying gifts for the lady in your life, a dictionary of Anglo-American sartorial terms and it ends, as it begins, with thoughts of England as home. The author has submitted the book in draft to the scrutiny of leading world experts on the various topics and so, as well as being entertaining, it is backed by authority.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f365d7c667766b15f5171a48c85e31535242c6","amp;dn":"History+of+Men%27s+Accessories+by+Nicholas+Storey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f365d7c667766b15f5171a48c85e31535242c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,243,101,215,198,103,118,107,21,245,23,26,72,200,94,49,83,82,66,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
