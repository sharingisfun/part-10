For their sake and ours, we need to abolish their governments and replace them with a single government.  This will take a long time and involve much bloodshed, but its for a good cause.  Heres what well need to do:\n\n    * Place our agents and helpers everywhere\n    * Take control of the media and use it in propaganda for our plans\n    * Start fights between different races, classes and religions\n    * Use bribery, threats and blackmail to get our way\n    * Use Freemasonic Lodges to attract potential public officials\n    * Appeal to successful peoples egos\n    * Appoint puppet leaders who can be controlled by blackmail\n    * Replace royal rule with socialist rule, then communism, then despotism\n    * Abolish all rights and freedoms, except the right of force by us\n    * Sacrifice people (including Jews sometimes) when necessary\n    * Eliminate religion; replace it with science and materialism\n    * Control the education system to spread deception and destroy intellect\n    * Rewrite history to our benefit\n    * Create entertaining distractions\n    * Corrupt minds with filth and perversion\n    * Encourage people to spy on one another\n    * Keep the masses in poverty and perpetual labor\n    * Take possession of all wealth, property and (especially) gold\n    * Use gold to manipulate the markets, cause depressions etc.\n    * Introduce a progressive tax on wealth\n    * Replace sound investment with speculation\n    * Make long-term interest-bearing loans to governments\n    * Give bad advice to governments and everyone else\n\nEventually the Goyim will be so angry with their governments (because well blame them for the resulting mess) that theyll gladly have us take over.  We will then appoint a descendant of David to be king of the world, and the remaining Goyim will bow down and sing his praises.  Everyone will live in peace and obedient order under his glorious rule.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn Their Tricks &amp; Traps From The Grand Master Goy: Eric Hufschmid &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.EricHufschmid.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.EricHufschmid.net&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ProThink.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ProThink.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://911MissingLinks.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://911MissingLinks.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Protocol #1 - What we Believe\n\n1-2.  Let's discuss the differences between us Jews and them Goyim (non-Jews).\n\n3.  People are basically evil by nature.  The bad people in this world far outnumber the good.  So the best form of government is not one that holds reasoned discussions with its people, but one that uses tyranny.\n\nMost people would gladly become an all-powerful dictator and sacrifice the well-being of others for their own benefit.\n\n4.  Where do people get their guidance?  And what stops them from acting out their evil desires?\n\n5.  In olden times people behaved like animals and were guided by the force of their bestial instincts.  Then as society developed, humans developed laws to follow.  But these laws were based on those same natural instincts.  So the only valid Law is the 'law of nature', i.e. the use of force.\n\n6.  Freedom is only an ideal: nobody really has it.  But if you want to win an election it's good to preach the ideals of freedom, even if you plan to deprive your voters of it.\n\nIf your opponent believes in the concept of freedom, like as a 'Libertarian', use that against him.  Because if he foolishly believes in freedom he won't be willing to use the underhanded tactics that you do.  He will play fair while you fight dirty.\n\nAny government that is based on freedom loses control over its people.  This is a terrible thing because remember that people are basically bad and the only way to guide them is by force.  If a government is guided by freedom the people will become weak.  We can take advantage of that weakness to overpower them and install a new government.\nGold\n\n7.  There was a time when religion was the guiding force of mankind.  But now, money is more important than religion.  Money ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ especially Gold ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ is the new guiding force because it gives power and freedom to the common people.  But that freedom is bad because theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll always want more and donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t know how to use it.  We canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t allow that.\n\nSelf-governance can be given to the masses, but only long enough for them to form a disorganized mob.  At that point we should intervene to create strife and racial hatred between their different classes and races.  This will cause them to fight and kill each other; hopefully starting a civil war.\n\n8.  Once a nation is engaged in civil war it will either destroy itself or be weakened to the point where it can be overtaken by another foreign power.  In either case our job will be done as theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll no longer be a threat to us.\n\nIf that nation ends up in bankruptcy weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll offer to loan them some of our money.  TheyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll have no option but to take it.\n\n9.  If anyone claims that the above is immoral, let me ask them this: Suppose a nation has two enemies: an external enemy which is a neighboring nation; and an internal enemy represented by political rivals who might try to overthrow the nation from within.  Well, if it is acceptable to destroy the other nation without any regard to morals, then why should it not also be acceptable to destroy the internal enemy?  After all, itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s the more dangerous of the two and the more likely to succeed in destroying society.\n\n10.  Who in their right mind could expect to govern the people by the use of reasoned debate?  Because those people, who are really quite stupid when compared to you, could then counter your arguments with their own silly arguments, and then youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½d have to keep debating them.  YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½d get nowhere.\n\nThe people who make up society (voters) are lame-brained numskulls who never achieve anything.  They spend their time following astrology charts and football.  They obviously canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t think logically.\n\nIn fact, the only time they agree on anything is when we trick the majority of them into believing something.  So they may as well just let us do our job of ruling them.  Otherwise the whole nation will erupt into anarchy.\n\n11.  Politics has nothing to do with morals.  Anyone who tries to govern according to morals is a moron and unsuitable for office.  A true politician must resort to cunning and lies if he expects to get anywhere.\n\nGreat qualities such as honesty and integrity are a burden for any ruler.  Anyone in politics who decides to start behaving like this ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ their career will be over before they know it.  Most Goyim believe that their rulers should have these qualities; but of course, we know better.\nMight is Right\n\n12.  There is a common-held belief that all people are born with ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rightsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, meaning that they should be allowed to do or have certain things in life, regardless of who they are.  But there is no way of proving this.\n\n13.  What is a right?  Where does it begin and end?\n\n14.  If a ruler starts granting rights, then everyone will start demanding new rights, especially libertarians.  Soon the nation will be overrun with rights and the ruler will look stupid.  From this I conclude that there is only one right: the right of the strong over the weak.  It gives a ruler the power to do whatever he wants, and to become supreme lord over those libertarian people who had better give up their rights to him voluntarily.\n\n15.  Our method of gaining power is better than any other because it grows invisibly.  Then when it has gained enough strength, we can unleash it; and it will be unstoppable because no one will be prepared for it.\n\n16.  We need to do a lot of evil things in order to gain power.  But thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s okay because once we have power over everything we can use it to do good things; like running the nations properly.  We could never do that if we gave people freedom.\n\nThe end justifies the means.  So letÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s put aside moral issues and focus on the end result.\n\n17.  We have a good long-range plan here and we canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t afford to deviate from it.  Otherwise all our work over the centuries would have been for nothing.\n\n18.  In order to plan our actions effectively, we must take into account that the common people are an incoherent mob of blathering idiots who canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t even look after themselves.\n\nThese people are blind, senseless and have no ability to reason.  In fact, theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll get suckered in by anyone.\n\nWhile the majority of them are total nincompoops that would follow one another over a cliff-top, as they have no leadership skills; occasionally one might emerge who appears to have some degree of intelligence.  However even these people donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t understand how to lead, and if you let them, theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½d bring a whole nation to ruin.\n\n19.  Only someone trained from childhood to serve as a leader can truly understand politics.\n\n20.  People left to look after themselves will be brought to ruin.  ThatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s because their leaders, who emerge from among them, are only interested in power and glory.  Is it possible for these people to put aside their self-interests and manage the affairs of their nation?\n\nLike, can they defend themselves from an external enemy?  No way!  When a project of that scale is divided up among the many dimwitted members of their society, it becomes unintelligible to them.\nWe Are Despots\n\n21.  Only a despotic ruler can effectively carry out large operations, and distribute all the necessary resources to the various departments so that important plans can be executed.  From this we conclude that the most effective government is one that concentrates all its power in the hands of a single responsible person.\n\nWithout absolute despotism there is no way to guide the masses and civilization will fall apart.  They are savage barbarians and behave like that at every opportunity.\n\nThe moment the people gain freedom it quickly turns to anarchy, which is just savagery.\n\n22.  Notice that when people are given freedom, they use it drink themselves senseless and behave like animals.  We ourselves should avoid behaving like that.\n\nGoyim are always drinking alcohol, or thinking about doing so.  We caused this to happen by using our many agents to promote it as part of their culture.  It increases immorality and makes their youth stupid.\n\nWe have agents placed everywhere, occupying many positions throughout society.  Such as tutors, lackeys, governesses in the houses of the wealthy, by clerks and others.  We also have a lot of women-agents acting as prostitutes who assist in the corruption process.\n\n23.  Our modus operandi is: Force and Make-Believe.  Only force gives you power, especially in the hands of a smooth talker.\n\nViolence and deception must be the rule for any politician who wants to remain in power.  This may be considered evil, but remember, evil is justified when it is used to achieve good.  Therefore we must not stop at bribery, deceit and treachery if they help us attain our end goal.\n\nIn politics we must know how to seize the property of others without hesitation if it allows us to gain full power over them.\n\n24.  We may need to wage many wars in order to achieve ultimate peace.  Between wars, we can replace the horrors of war by less noticeable and more satisfactory sentences of death.  This is necessary to maintain terror in the populace which leads to blind submission.\n\nA just but merciless penal system is the greatest strength of the State.  We do this not only for the sake of gain but also in the name of duty.  For the sake of our victory, we must stick to the program of violence and make-believe.\n\nIt is enough for them to know that we are merciless for any disobedience to cease.\n\nThe principle of balancing accounts (particularly the repayment of debts) is strongly ingrained and one which we will take advantage of.  We will use this principle as a means to bring all governments under the control of our super-government.\nWe Shall End Liberty\n\n25.  Far back in ancient times we were the first to stand among crowds of people and cry out the words &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot;.  The people fell for our bait.  They picked up those words and started repeating them parrot-like throughout the world.  As a result they have taken away the well-being of the world and the true freedom of the individual, which was formerly well protected from mob pressure.\n\nThe so-called wise men of the Goyim, the intellectuals, could not make anything out of these words.  They just cannot see that in nature there is no equality or freedom; that nature herself has established inequality of minds, characters and capacities.  They never stopped to consider that the mob is blind thing, and as such, can only elect leaders that must be as blind as the mob itself.  And even if the mob does manage to find someone intelligent, that person wouldnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t understand politics, as pointed out earlier.  Goyim donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t take any of this into consideration.\n\n26.  Thanks to dumb-assed libertarians, the words &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; have spread to all corners of the earth.\n\nThese words installed peace, quiet and solidarity throughout all Goyim of the earth, and thus weakened their strength.\n\nAs you will see later, this helped us to our victory: it gave us the possibility of getting our hands on the master stroke ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the destruction of privileges and power of their royalty.  That royal class was the only defense the Goyim had against us.\n\nOn the ruins of the eternal and heir-based aristocracy of the Goyim we have set up the aristocracy of our educated class headed by the aristocracy of money.\n\nThe entry qualifications to this aristocracy are based on wealth (which is dependent upon us) and on knowledge, which also comes from us, especially from our learned elders who have provided much inspiration.\n\n27.  Our victory has been made easier by fact that whenever we sought favors from men in power we always appealed to their most basic of desires.  Like cash-money and all kinds of material goodies.  Even one human weakness is often enough to pass control of these men over to those offering the bribes.\n\n28.  The concept of freedom has enabled us to convince the people of all countries that their government is a servant of the people, that the people are the true owners of the country and that that servant can be replaced like a worn-out glove.\n\n29.  This possibility of replacing the representatives of the people gives us the power to appoint a new government.\nTop of Protocols\n\nProtocol #2 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Economic Wars\n\n1.  Whenever we start a war, we shouldnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t do so for the purpose of gaining territory; at least not as a general rule.  Instead we should do it for economic gains.  This way everyone will see how powerful we are; and they will be in fear of our many international spies and agents who roam the earth without limitation.\n\nNational rights will then be wiped out by our international rights, which are the proper sense of right ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the right of force.  We will then rule the nations in the same way that the nations rule their citizens.\n\n2.  The people chosen by us to act as rulers of a nation will not be those trained in the art of leadership.  Instead weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll select them based on their capacity to take orders.  TheyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll be puppets under the control of smart men who will be their advisers: specialists bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world.\n\nAs you well know, these specialists of ours have been trained to get the information they need from our political plans, from the lessons of history, and from observations made of current events.\n\nThe Goyim are not guided by observations of history, but by theories on how the world is supposed to work.  They donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t bother to check whether those theories are true or not.  So donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t trouble yourself with them.  Let them amuse themselves until the final hour strikes, in their utopian beliefs, in entertainments, or on the memories of all they have enjoyed.\n\nLet them organize their beliefs around scientific theories.  We are constantly using our media to encourage Goyim to have blind confidence in these theories.\n\nThe intellectuals of the Goyim will fill their minds with this scientific knowledge without questioning its validity or usefulness.  Our agent specialists have carefully determined what type of knowledge the intellectuals receive, and in this way we can steer their minds in the direction we want.\nDestructive Education\n\n3.  Do not suppose for a moment that these statements are empty words: think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzsche-ism.  To us Jews it should be obvious to see how destructive these ideologies have been upon the minds of the Goyim.\n\n4.  It is vital that we take into account the thoughts, characters and cultural tendencies of the nations in order that we avoid making mistakes in the takeover of their political and administrative affairs.\n\nIn order for us to succeed, we must adjust our methods to accommodate for the cultural and regional differences of nations.  Similarly, if a culture should change over time, we must change our methods to suit.\n\n5.  The Media has a great influence on peopleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s thoughts.  It was previously in the hands of sovereign governments, but is now under our control.\n\nOur MediaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s role is to convince people that our plans are important, and to allow them to express some dissatisfaction which will help create discontent.  The Media can be a powerful force for freedom of speech.  But Goyim donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t know how to use this force so it always falls into our hands.\n\nThrough the Media we have gained the power of influence while remaining invisible.  Thanks to the Media we now have the Gold in our hands.  Mind you, we also needed to use an awful lot of violence and underhanded tactics to achieve this.\n\nBut it was worth it, even though we had to sacrifice many of our own people.  In the eyes of God, one Jew is worth a thousand Goyim.\nTop of Protocols\n\nProtocol #3 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Methods of Conquest\n\n1.  I have some good news.  WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re only a few steps away from our goal.  ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a small way to go, but when we get there, weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll have achieved the closing of our Symbolic Snake.  This Snake represents the spreading of our people across Europe.  When the Snake closes into a loop, the whole of Europe will be locked in its constricting coils.\n\n2.  The constitutions of the various nations will soon break down.  For we have designed them with a certain lack of accurate balance: such that their component verses grind against each other to the point where the whole constitution falls apart.\n\nGoyim are under the impression that those versus are welded strongly together and any discrepancies between them should balance out over time.  But their monarchs, who might enforce that welding, are surrounded by representatives who play the role of fools lusting for uncontrolled and irresponsible power.\n\nThe monarchs owe their power to the terror that has been breathed into their palaces.  As they no longer have direct access to their people, the kings on their thrones are not able to come to terms with them, and cannot strengthen themselves against those who seek to take their power.\n\nWe have created a rift between the far-sighted Sovereign Power and the blind force of the people, such that both have lost their effectiveness.  For like the blind man and his stick, they are powerless apart.\n\n3.  In order to incite those who seek power to misuse that power, we have caused all political forces to turn against one other.  This breaks up their libertarian desires toward seeking independence.\n\nTo this end we have stirred up every political, social and minority group.  We have armed all sides.  We have labeled authority as a target for every ambition.\n\nWe have turned parliaments into gladiatorial arenas where many confused issues brawl.  With a bit more of this, disorders and bankruptcy will be universal.\n\n4.  Parliaments and Administrative Boards have been turned into oratorical contests of inexhaustible babblers.  Unscrupulous journalists descend upon executive officials daily.\n\nAbuses of power will be the final touch in preparing all institutions for their overthrow.  Everything will then fall to pieces under the attacks of angry mobs.\nPoverty is Our Weapon\n\n5.  Due to the ever-present threat of poverty, all people have been forced into working endlessly.  They have been chained by slavery and serfdom.  Well, perhaps they could save enough money to escape from their daily grind.  But they would never have enough to afford what they really want.\n\nWe included some rights for the people into the constitution which are fictitious and not actual rights.  All these so-called &quot;PeopleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Rights&quot; can exist only as an idea; an idea which can never be realized in practical life.\n\nHow does it help the low-class laborer if people are given freedom of speech but only use it to babble?  Or if journalists have the right to scribble any nonsense side by side with good stuff?  The laborer gains nothing from this because he still must work as before.  He gains nothing from the constitution other than the few pitiful crumbs which we fling at him from our table in exchange for his voting in favor of what we dictate: in favor of the men we place in power, who are the servants of our specialist agents.\n\nConstitutional rights for a poor man are no more than a bitter piece of irony.  Because the fact that he must toil almost all day gives him no time to use them.  On the other hand, it robs him of any guarantee of regular and certain earnings by making him susceptible to strikes by his comrades or lockouts by his masters.\nWe Support Communism\n\n6.  The people, under our guidance, have annihilated their aristocracy, who were their one and only defense and foster-mother, who could have worked for the sake of the peopleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s advantage, and who were inseparably bound up with the well-being of the people.\n\nNowadays, with the destruction of the aristocracy, the people have fallen into the grips of merciless money-grubbing scoundrels who have laid a pitiless and cruel yoke upon the necks of the workers.\n\n7.  We appear on the scene as alleged saviors of the worker from this oppression.  Then we propose that he join the ranks of our fighting forces ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Socialists, Anarchists, Communists ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ to whom we always give support in accordance with an alleged brotherly rule (of the solidarity of all humanity) of our social masonry.\n\nThe aristocracy, which lawfully enjoyed the labor of the workers, was interested in seeing that the workers were well fed, healthy, and strong. We are interested in just the opposite ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ in the decline and killing of the goyim.\n\nOur power is in the chronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker because by this he will become our slave.  He will have neither the strength nor the energy to oppose us.  Hunger surely gives us more authority to rule the worker than the legal authority given to the aristocracy by the rule of kings.\n\n8.  We will highlight the differences of wealth between the rich and the poor.  The emotions of envy and hatred which will then arise in the poor, due to their want of the wealth, will be whipped into mob frenzy.  Through their hands we shall wipe out all those who hinder us on our way.\n\n9.  When the hour strikes for our sovereign lord of the entire world to be crowned, it is these same hands which will sweep away everything that might be a hindrance to that.\n\n10.  The Goyim have lost the habit of thinking unless prompted by the suggestions of our specialists.  Therefore they do not see the urgent necessity of what we, when our kingdom comes, shall adopt at once.  Namely that it is essential to teach in national schools one simple, true piece of knowledge, the basis of all knowledge, and the knowledge of the structure of human life, which is that: Social existence requires division of labor, and consequently, the division of men into classes and conditions.\n\nIt is essential for all to know that owing to differences in the occupations of humans, there cannot be any equality among them.  Someone that commits an act that compromises a whole class cannot be held as equally responsible before the law, as compared to someone who affects only himself.\n\nThe true knowledge of the structure of society ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ secrets which we keep from the Goyim ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ would reveal that positions of work must correspond with the education that was given to a worker.  Otherwise they might suffer.\n\nAfter a thorough study of this knowledge, people will voluntarily submit to authority and accept whatever position is given to them in the State.\n\nThe people blindly believe what they read in print, and given their present state of ignorance, they possess a sense of blind hatred toward anyone who has more wealth or lives in better condition than themselves.  They have no understanding of the purpose of social classes.\nJews Will Be Safe\n\n11.  This hatred will be still further magnified by the effects of an economic crisis, which will halt trading on the exchanges and bring industry to a standstill.\n\nWe shall create this crises by all the secret subterranean methods open to us and with the aid of Gold, which is all in our hands: a universal economic crises whereby we shall throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers simultaneously in all the countries of Europe.\n\nThese mobs will rush delightedly to shed the blood of those whom, in the simplicity of their ignorance, they have envied from an early age, and whose property they will then be able to loot.\n\n12.  &quot;Ours&quot; they will not touch, because the moment of attack will be known to us and we shall take measures to protect our own.\n\n13.  We have demonstrated that progress will bring all the Goyim to the realm of reason.  Our despotism will be precisely that; for it will know how, by calculated severe measures, to pacify all unrest, and burn liberalism out of all institutions.\n\n14.  When the population realizes that the utopia of communism is not ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½as advertisedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, and that all those promises of freedom and indulgences of wealth they imagined are not there, they will find themselves stuck like a blind man on a host of stumbling blocks.\n\n15.  They have rushed to find a guide; they never had the sense to return to the former state and they have laid down their full sovereign powers at our feet.  Remember the French Revolution, to which it was we who gave it the prefix of &quot;Great&quot;: the secrets of its preparations are well known to us for it was wholly the work of our hands.\n\n16.  At the present day we are, as an international force, invincible, because if attacked by some State we will be supported by other States.\n\nThe Goyim people are rascals who bow down to force, but are merciless toward weakness in others, unforgiving of their faults, and enjoy committing crimes.  They cannot bear the contradictions of a free social system, but are willing to become martyrs in the face of the violence of bold despotism.  It is those qualities that help us become independent.\n\nThe Goyim people suffer patiently under the abuses of the worst dictators, even while those dictators would have beheaded twenty of their kings.\n\n17.  Why is it that the people are willing to put up with such abuse, and with the execution of their aristocracy?\n\n18.  It is because the dictators tell the people that these abuses they are inflicting are done for the highest purpose ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ to secure the welfare of the peoples, the international brotherhood of them all, their solidarity and equality of rights.  Naturally they do not tell the peoples that this unification must be accomplished only under our sovereign rule.\n\n19.  And thus the people condemn the upright and acquit the guilty, persuaded ever more and more that it can do whatsoever it wishes.  Thanks to this state of things, the people are destroying every kind of stability and creating disorders at every turn.\n\n20.  The word &quot;freedom&quot; brings out the communities of men to fight against every kind of force, against every kind of authority even against God and the laws of nature.\n\nFor this reason we, when we finally step into our kingdom, shall have to erase this word from the language of life; implying that freedom is a principle of brute force which turns mobs into bloodthirsty beasts.\n\n21.  These beasts, it is true, fall asleep again once they have drunk their fill of blood, and at such time can easily be riveted into their chains.  But if they are not given blood they will not sleep and will continue to struggle.\nTop of Protocols\n\nProtocol #4 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Materialism to Replace Religion\n\n1.  Every republic passes through several stages.  The first of these is the early days of mad raging by the blind mob, tossed here and there, to and fro.  The second is demagogy which leads to anarchy and that inevitably leads to despotism.  This is not a legal and observable, and therefore responsible, type of despotism.  Rather itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a hidden form of despotism thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s in the hands of some secret organization.  This organization is unscrupulous because it works behind the backs of the people using agents who have no accountability, and who donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t serve the people, only the organization.  These agents are continually changing, and this benefits the organization because it doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t have to give them special rewards for long times in service.\n\n2.  Who or what has the ability to overthrow an invisible force?  Because that is precisely what our Force is.  Gentile-based Freemasonry serves as a smokescreen for us and our plans.  But the plan of action of our Force, even its very existence, remains an unknown mystery to the people.\nWe Shall Destroy God\n\n3.  Even freedom might be harmless and have its place in our State economy without harming the well-being of the people if it is based on a faith in God and on the brotherhood of humanity ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ providing that it remains disconnected with the concept of equality.  Equality is negated by the very laws of creation, for these laws have established subordination.\n\nWith faith such as this, a people might be governed by a trusteeship of parishes, and would walk contentedly and humbly under the guiding hand of its spiritual pastor while submitting to the plans of God upon earth.\n\nThis is the reason why it is essential for us to undermine all faith, to tear out of the mind of the Goyim and the principle of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½God the Father, the Son, and the Holy SpiritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, and to put in its place arithmetical calculations and material needs.\n\n4.  In order to give the Goyim no time to think and notice what is happening, their minds must be diverted towards industry and trade.  Thus, all the nations will be swallowed up in the pursuit of gain and, in the race for it, they wonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t notice their common enemy.\n\nBut again, in order that freedom may once and for all disintegrate, and ruin the communities of the Goyim, we must put industry on a speculative basis.  The result of this will be that the wealth which is mined from the earth will not be invested in productive industry, but will pass to institutions that deal in speculation (finance gambling), which are under our ownership.\n\n5.  The intensified struggle for superiority and the shocks delivered to economic life will create, no, have already created, disenchanted, cold and heartless communities.\n\nSuch communities will lose interest in, and foster a strong aversion toward sound political management and religion. Their only guide will be that of monetary gain, i.e. Gold, which they will erect into a bona fide cult for the sake of those material delights which it can give.\n\nThen a day of reckoning will come when, not for the sake of righteousness, not even to win wealth, but solely out of hatred towards those privileged, the lower classes of the Goyim will follow our lead and rise against our rivals for power: the intellectuals of the Goyim.\nTop of Protocols\n\nProtocol #5 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Despotism and Modern Progress\n\n1.  What form of administrative rule can be given to communities in which corruption has penetrated everywhere; communities where riches are obtained only by the clever surprise tactics of con artists; where looseness reigns; where morality is maintained, not by voluntarily accepted principles, but by harsh laws and strong enforcement; where feelings towards religion and country are obligated only by fashionable persuasions?\n\nWhat form of rule is to be given to these communities other than that despotism which I shall describe to you later?  We shall create a strong central government in order to gain a stranglehold on those communities.\n\nWe shall thoroughly regulate all aspects of the public life of our subjects with new laws.\n\nThese laws will withdraw, one by one, all the privileges and freedoms which have been permitted to the Goyim; and our kingdom will be distinguished by a despotism of such magnificent proportions that, at any moment and in every place, it will be in a position to wipe out any Goyim who dares to oppose us, either in words or by actions.\n\n2.  You may think that for a despotism of this description to come into being, it would not be consistent with the progress of history, and that it could not exist in this modern age.  But I will prove to you that it is, and that it could.\n\n3.  Back in the days when the peoples looked at kings on their thrones, just as they would look upon a pure manifestation of the will of God, they submitted without a murmur to the despotic power of kings.  But from the day when we placed the concept of their own rights into their minds they began to regard the occupants of thrones as mere ordinary mortals.\n\nThe god-like charm of the Lord's Anointed has fallen from the heads of kings in the eyes of the people.  And when we also robbed them of their faith in God, the might of authoritative power fell into the realm of public ownership, and was then seized by us.\nMasses Led By Lies\n\n4.  Moreover, the art of directing masses and individuals by means of cleverly manipulated theory and words, by laws, and by all sorts of other odd methods: the Goyim understand none of this because it belongs to the specialists of our collective governing intelligence.\n\nReared on analysis, observation, and delicate calculations: in this type of skill we have no rivals, any more than we have rivals in the drawing up of plans of political actions and solidarity.  In this respect the Roman Catholic Church might have compared with us, but we have conspired to discredit them in the eyes of the unthinking mob since they are an observable organization, while we ourselves have kept our secret organization in the shade the whole time.\n\nHowever, it is probably all the same to the world, which doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t really care who its sovereign lord is: whether the head of Catholicism or our despot of the blood of Zion!\n\nBut to us, the Chosen People, it is very far from being a matter of indifference.\n\n5.  For a time perhaps, we might be successfully dealt with by a coalition of the Goyim of the entire world.  But we are protected from this danger by the discord existing among them.  Their loyalties to their own separate groups, races and classes are now so deeply ingrained that they can never be removed.\n\nWe have set one against another: the personal and national beliefs of the Goyim, religious and race hatreds, which we have fostered into a huge growth in the course of the past twenty centuries.\n\nThis is the reason why there is not one State which would anywhere receive support if it were to raise its arm, for every one of them must bear in mind that any agreement against us would be unprofitable to itself.  We are too strong ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ there is no evading our power.\n\nThe nations cannot come to even an inconsiderable private agreement without our secretly having a hand in it.\n\n6.  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Per me Reges regnantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ is Latin for: &quot;It is through me that Kings reign.&quot;  And it was said by the prophets that we were chosen by God Himself to rule over the whole earth.  God has endowed us with genius so that we may do this task.\n\nIf genius was in an opposing camp it would still struggle against us, but even so, a newcomer is no match for the old-established settler: the struggle would be merciless between us, such a fight as the world has never seen.\n\nYes, and the genius on their side would have arrived too late.  All the wheels of the machinery of all States go via the force of the engine, which is in our hands.  And that engine of the machinery of States is - Gold.\n\nThe science of political economy invented by our learned elders has placed great value on the importance of money-capital for such a long time.\nMonopoly Capital\n\n7.  Capital, if it is to function without limitations, must be free to establish a monopoly of industry and trade.  This is already being put into place by an unseen hand in all quarters of the world.\n\nThis freedom will give political strength to those engaged in industry, and that will help us to oppress the people.  Nowadays it is more important to disarm the peoples than to lead them into war.  If those people have a passion that has suddenly ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½burst into flamesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, it more important to use it to our advantage than it is to quench it.  Finally, it more important to eradicate them.\n\n\nThe principle goal of our directors consists of this: to weaken the public mind by criticism; to lead it away from serious reflections which may arouse calculated resistance; and to distract the forces of the mind towards meaningless fights.\n\n8.  Throughout history the people of the world have accepted campaign promises at face value. Those people are content with a show and rarely pause to check afterward whether the promises have been kept.  The same holds true for individuals outside the political arena.\n\nTherefore we shall establish ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ShowÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ institutions which will give eloquent ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½proofÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ of their benefit to progress.\n\n9.  We shall assume to ourselves to represent the voice of freedom of all parties, of all directions, and we shall make our representative be a voice in orators who will speak so much that they will exhaust the patience of their hearers and bring about a hatred of oratory.\n\n10.  In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into a state of bewilderment by broadcasting so many contradictory opinions from all sides and for such a long time that it will make the Goyim lose their heads in a maze of confusion.  They will come to realize that the best thing is to have no opinion of any kind in political matters, especially when it is intended that the public should not understand the issues being discussed.  In that way the Goyim will leave the opinions and understanding of the issues to those who guide the public.  This is the first secret.\n\n11.  The second secret necessity for the success of our government consists of the following: To emphasize the national failings of bad habits, misplaced passions, and troubling conditions of everyday life, to such an extent that it will be impossible for anyone to know where he is in the resulting chaos.  As a result, the people will fail to understand one another.\n\nThis measure will also serve us in another way, namely, to sow discord in all parties, to dislocate all collective forces which are still unwilling to submit to us, and to discourage any kind of personal initiative which might hinder our affairs in any way.  There is nothing more dangerous than personal initiative: if it has genius behind it, such initiative can do more harm than can be done by millions of people among whom we have sown discord.\n\nWe must direct the education of the Goyim communities such that whenever they come upon a matter requiring initiative they throw up their hands in despairing impotence.  The strain which results from lack of achievement saps the spirit when compared side-by-side with the accomplishment of a successful person.\n\nFrom this comparison arises grave moral shocks, disenchantments and failures.  By all these means we shall so wear down the Goyim that they will be compelled to offer us international power of a nature that by its position will enable us without any violence gradually to absorb all the state forces of the world and to form a super-government.\n\nIn place of the rulers of today we shall set up a monstrosity called the Super-Government Administration.  Its tentacles will reach out in all directions like grappling hooks and its organization will be of such colossal dimensions that it cannot fail to subdue all the nations of the world.\nTop of Protocols\n\nProtocol #6 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Take-Over Technique\n\n1.  We shall soon begin to establish huge monopolies, reservoirs of colossal riches, upon which even large fortunes of the Goyim will depend to such an extent that they will go to the bottom together with the credit of the States on the day after the political crash...\n\n2.  You gentlemen here that are economists, just make an estimate of the significance of this combination! ...\n\n3.  In every possible way, we must show the importance of our Super-Government by presenting it as the Protector and Benefactor of all those who voluntarily submit to us.\n\n4.  The aristocracy of the Goyim as a political force is dead.  We need not take it into account.  But as landed proprietors they can still be harmful to us from the fact that they are self-sufficient in the resources upon which they live.\n\nIt is essential therefore for us at whatever cost to deprive them of their land.  This object will be best attained by increasing the burdens upon landed property ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ by loading lands with debts.  These measures will reduce land ownership and keep it in a state of humble and unconditional submission.\n\n5.  The aristocrats of the Goyim, being incapable of contenting themselves with little, due to their upbringing, will rapidly burn up and fizzle out.\nWe Shall Enslave Gentiles\n\n6.  At the same time we must intensively promote trade and industry, but, first and foremost, speculation.  The part played by speculation is to suppress industry.  The absence of speculative industry will multiply capital in private hands and will serve to restore agriculture by freeing the land from the debts of banks.\n\nWhat we want is that industry should drain both labor and capital from the land.  Then by means of speculation, transfer all the money of the world into our hands, and thereby throw all the Goyim into the ranks of the working class.\n\nThen the Goyim will bow down before us; if for no other reason but to get the right to exist.\n\n7.  To complete the ruin of the industry of the Goyim we shall bring, to the assistance of speculation, the luxury which we have encouraged among the Goyim: that greedy demand for luxury which is swallowing up everything.\n\nWe shall raise the rate of wages.  However this will not bring any advantage to the workers, because at the same time, we shall also cause a rise in prices of items that are essential to life.  We shall claim that these increases were caused by a decline in agriculture and cattle breeding.  We shall, craftily and thoroughly, further undermine sources of production, by accustoming the workers to anarchy and to drunkenness.  Additionally we shall take all measures to uproot all the educated forces of the Goyim from the face of the earth.\n\n8.  In order that the true meaning of things is not discovered by the Goyim before the proper time, we shall mask it under an alleged enthusiastic desire to serve the working classes and the great principles of political economy, which our economic theories carry with much energetic propaganda.\nTop of Protocols\n\nProtocol #7 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ World Wide Wars\n\n1.  The increase in size of the military, police forces, and of their armaments, are all essential for the completion of the above plans.\n\nThe situation we need to arrive at is that the populations of the worldÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s nations consist of only: (1) ourselves; (2) the masses of the working class; (3) a few millionaires devoted to our interests; and (4) police and soldiers.\n\n2.  Throughout all Europe and countries that have relations with Europe, and in other continents also, we must create unrest, disagreement and hostility.\n\nThis gives us a double advantage.  Firstly, it deters countries from acting against us.  For they will know that we have the power to create disorders or to restore order whenever we like.  All these countries will see us as an unavoidable force of authority.\n\nSecondly, if we threaten to withdraw or muddle up our existing arrangements with these countries, this would also create havoc.  You see, over many years we have inserted ourselves into the administrative machinery of their cabinets, making them dependent upon us.  In order to infiltrate in this manner we must involve ourselves in maters like economic treaties or loan obligations.  We need to use great cunning during negotiations and agreements, but instead of using our usual threatening language, weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll instead do the opposite and don the mask of honesty and complacency.\n\nIn this way the peoples and governments of the Goyim, whom we have taught to look at only the outside of whatever we present to their notice, will continue to accept us as the benefactors and saviors of the human race.\nUniversal War\n\n3.  If any country dares to oppose us, we must be in a position to respond by way of war.  We will do this by teaming up with the neighbors of that country.  But if those neighbors should also venture to stand collectively together against us, then we must resist with a universal war.\n\n4.  The main factor of success in politics is to operate in secrecy.  A diplomat must say one thing but then do another.\n\n5.  We must compel the governments of the Goyim to take action in the direction favored by our well thought-out plan, which is nearing completion, by what we shall claim is public opinion.  This ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½opinionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ will be secretly promoted by us through the means of that so-called &quot;Great Power&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the media, which, apart from a few unimportant exceptions, is already entirely in our hands.\n\nIn order to display our system of keeping the governments of the Goyim in Europe in check, we shall show our strength by committing terrorist attacks against one of them.  If the governments of Europe should collectively rise against us, we shall respond using the military might of America or China or Japan.\nTop of Protocols\n\nProtocol #8 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Provisional Government\n\n1. We must arm ourselves with all the weapons which our opponents might use against us.\n\nWe need to make our actions look valid and proper from a legal view-point.  Occasionally weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll pronounce judgments that might appear biased or unjust.  So we need to brush up on our legal-poetry to make our arguments sound convincing because itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s important that we get our judgments passed.  We will use expressions that sound like the most exalted moral principles converted into a legal form.\n\n\n.......
