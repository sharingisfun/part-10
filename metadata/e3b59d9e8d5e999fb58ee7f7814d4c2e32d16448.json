Assembled in Los Angeles in 1966 by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; \nRafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from \n1966 to 1968, the musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith \nand Peter Tork, and Englishman Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer \nDon Kirshner.\n\nDavy Jones was born at 20 Leamington Street, Openshaw, Manchester, Lancashire, England, on 30 December 1945. \nAt the age of 11, he began his acting career and appeared on the British television soap opera Coronation Street \nwhich was produced at Granada Studios by Granada Television in Manchester.
