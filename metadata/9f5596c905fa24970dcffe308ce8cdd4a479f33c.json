The newly composed &quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot; was to be the B-side. Other musicians involved included singer/lyricist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Gary Driscoll of blues rock band Elf, and cellist Hugh McDowell of ELO. Satisfied with the two tracks, Blackmore decided to extend the sessions to a full album. \n\nFor the album the other members of Elf, keyboardist Micky Lee Soule and bassist Craig Gruber were utilised. The album was recorded in Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany during FebruaryÃ¢â‚¬â€œMarch 1975. Though it was originally thought to be a solo album, the record was billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, and later progressed to a new band project. Blackmore and Dio did promotional work for the album. Shortly after the album was released, all Elf members,excluding Dio, were sacked, and Blackmore recruited new musicians for subsequent Rainbow albums. This first line-up never performed live, and the live photos used in the album art are of Blackmore while with Deep Purple and of Elf playing live.\n\nThe last track of the album &quot;Still I'm Sad&quot; is an instrumental cover of a song by The Yardbirds from their 1965 album Having a Rave Up with The Yardbirds. &quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot; uses a similar chord progression and vocal melody to Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Little Wing&quot; from the 1967 album Axis: Bold as Love.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot;   \t  \t4:42\n2. \t&quot;Self Portrait&quot;   \t  \t3:17\n3. \t&quot;Black Sheep of the Family&quot; (Quatermass cover) \tSteve Hammond \t3:22\n4. \t&quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot;   \t  \t6:27\n5. \t&quot;Snake Charmer&quot;   \t  \t4:33\n6. \t&quot;The Temple of the King&quot;   \t  \t4:45\n7. \t&quot;If You Don't Like Rock 'n' Roll&quot;   \t  \t2:38\n8. \t&quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot;   \t  \t3:31\n9. \t&quot;Still I'm Sad&quot; (The Yardbirds cover) \t3:51","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f5596c905fa24970dcffe308ce8cdd4a479f33c","amp;dn":"Rainbow+-+Ritchie+Blackmore%27s+Rainbow+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f5596c905fa24970dcffe308ce8cdd4a479f33c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,85,150,201,5,250,36,151,13,207,254,48,140,232,205,212,164,121,243,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
