Whether you're\njust starting out in one of these fields or migrating to C4D after\nmany years in another program, your training should begin here. In\nthis course, author Ian Robinson covers key C4D concepts, such as\nobject hierarchies and relationships, and the essential skills for\nmodeling with primitive objects, splines and generator objects\nsubdivision surfaces, and polygons. He also shows how to give your\n3D models realistic-looking surfaces the kind of surfaces that make\nobjects seem bumpy, metallic, shiny, or even transparent with\nmaterials and lighting. The final chapters of the course cover\nkeyframe animation, camera movement, and C4D's popular MoGraph\nmodule. Dive in and learn what CINEMA 4D has in store for you\n\nTopics include:\nUnderstanding the CINEMA 4D workflow\nNavigating the viewports\nExploring the importance of object hierarchy\nModeling with primitives and splines\nModeling with the Knife and Extrude tools\nUsing Content Browser presets\nDeforming objects\nApplying materials and texturing\nCreating and manipulating light sources\nAnimating in the Timeline with keyframes\nControlling camera movement\nRendering and adjusting final render settings\nCompositing in After Effects\nUsing MoGraph\nSculpting\nMotion tracking\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nUnpack, burn or mount and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d608d773aa07e4fee39890461f9fde71b3fea861","amp;dn":"Lynda.com.CINEMA.4D.R16.Essential.Training-QUASAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d608d773aa07e4fee39890461f9fde71b3fea861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,8,215,115,170,7,228,254,227,152,144,70,31,159,222,113,179,254,168,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
