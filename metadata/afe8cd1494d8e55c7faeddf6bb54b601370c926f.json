Should work just fine in all versions of the program. ~ DH\n- - -\n*What are Textures?\n- - -\nWhat exactly is a texture? The term texture when used in photoshop refers to an image that is used  on top of your own image that when adjusted via blend modes or opacity imparts a Ã¢â‚¬Å“textureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on your image. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“textureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be of a physical texture, in fact it could be nearly anything, including another photo. Generally however textures will be photographs or scans of old pieces of paper, fabric, a hand written letter, etc. But it could be a image of clouds, rain drops on a windshield, a bokeh pattern, bubbles, water reflections, and on and on. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the beauty of using textures, they could be anything and combined infinitely to create a wide range of different looks. (The images themselves are even large enough to use as personal desktop wallpapers, without any editing in PS needed.)\n- - -\nThere are a total of 233 textures, in 20 themed folders.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afe8cd1494d8e55c7faeddf6bb54b601370c926f","amp;dn":"Ultimate+PS+Texture+Pack+%7E+Diva+of+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afe8cd1494d8e55c7faeddf6bb54b601370c926f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,232,205,20,148,216,229,92,127,174,221,246,187,84,182,1,55,12,146,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
