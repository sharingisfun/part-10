His unique sound was brilliantly described\nas &quot;Rain-streaked spiritual jazz from Manchester&quot; by the Independent On Sunday and\nprevious albums have found Halsall exploring the modal jazz of John and Alice\nColtrane or paying heartfelt tribute to the hard bop of the late '50s and early '60s,\nbut on Fletcher Moss Park he offers his most personal statement yet.\n\nWritten and recorded over the last couple of years, Fletcher Moss Park is inspired by\none of Manchester's most beautiful places. A rambling, multi-tiered park of walkways\nand dreamy gardens that offers the contemplative Halsall a place of peace and respite\nfrom the city, a meditative space to think and write in. The stillness and beauty of\nthe surroundings have steeped into his beautiful compositions for this album. Elegant\nand sincere, Halsall's compositions draw on his love of spiritual jazz, modern dance\nmusic and even his work with the award-winning Brighouse &amp; Rastrick Brass Band\nearlier this year. Halsall who has recently been exploring his music in a\nstripped-back, electronica influenced, trio (featuring Taz Modi and Luke Flowers who\nalso appear here) as well as the 12 piece Gondwana Orchestra has always favoured an\nearthy honestly and direct communication over tricksy arrangements and it is this\ndeceptively simple openness that gives his music such a unique flavour as the young\ncomposer and producer seeks to express his feelings and thoughts with his music.\n\nFletcher Moss Park opens with three tracks featuring saxophonist Nat Birchall,\nharpist Rachael Gladwin and pianist Adam Fairhall alongside bassist Gavin Barras and\ndrummer Gaz Hughes all long running members of Halsall's sextet. The beautiful Cherry\nBlossom opens with a nod to Alice Coltrane before exploring it's own contemplative\ntrajectory, the title track features a gorgeous opening from harpist Gladwin and one\nof Halsall's trademark slow but foot tappingly catchy grooves, Mary Emma Louise is an\nelegant tribute to someone special and features some beautifully wistful playing from\nthe composer. Sailing Out To Sea and Wee Lan offer a change in mood, two short\ninterludes for violin (Holly Simpson and Davinder Singh), cello (Adrianne Wininsky)\nand double bass (Barras), Halsall chose not to play here feeling that the brief\nmusical sketches caught his intentions perfectly. Finally the album closes with the\ntwo most recent compositions, the reposeful Sun In September which features fine work\nfrom flautist Lisa Mallett, alongside pianist Taz Modi and drummer Luke Flowers and\nthe uplifting Finding My Way, which with it's compelling groove and fine drumming\nfrom Flowers (best known for his work with Cinematic Orchestra) offers a nod towards\nHalsall's love of contemporary electronic music as well as a hint of future projects.\nBut as with the writing here you can be sure that wherever Halsall's muse takes him\nhis music will remain heartfelt and life affirming in it's elegant directness as he\nexplores his own unique musical terrain that stretches from the bucolic stillness of\nFletcher Moss Park to a world far beyond!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16523b4747981fe9b84e56afc8b6966b69c5a4b4","amp;dn":"Matthew+Halsall-Fletcher+Moss+Park-WEB-2012-USR-JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16523b4747981fe9b84e56afc8b6966b69c5a4b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,82,59,71,71,152,31,233,184,78,86,175,200,182,150,107,105,197,164,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
