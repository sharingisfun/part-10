Many of these tales have been collected orally by the author and appear now in print for the first time. In the outlying parts of the Hebrides where only Gaelic: is spoken by the older inhabitants these tales could only be collected by one who is familiar with the language. and the Author is well qualified for the task he has undertaken. He has been a collector all his life and, Highland born, familiar with Gaelic: sinc:e he could speak. With the passinc years the sources for oral collection of these old tales are bec:ominc fewer and less accessible and as there ha. been a growing interest in Celtic literature and Celtic music in recent years the time would seem ripe for a new one-volume collection of folk tales. The book is illustrated with reproductions from the Author's own photographs.\n\nCONTENTS\nI. Faeries: Their Properties and Activities 1\nII. Faery Music 29\nIII. Faery Dogs and Faery Cattle 37\nIV.
