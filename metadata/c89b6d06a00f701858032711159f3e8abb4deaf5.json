It's much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.&quot; Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director\nBroadmoor, the most famous high secure hospital in the world, has allowed unprecedented access to television cameras for this new two-part ITV documentary. \nFor the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It's best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. \nFilmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It's the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops. \nThe result is an unprecedented insight into what really goes on behind those infamous red brick walls; how violent patients are treated, what they do each day and who the men and women are, who work with the country's most dangerous men. It took five years to negotiate this unprecedented level of access.\nIn total the hospital treats around 200 of the most violent and mentally disturbed men in the country, aiming to prevent them from being a danger to themselves and to others. The men in Broadmoor are classed as vulnerable adults so not all of them were capable of giving consent to appear in the series. The most notorious patients have not taken part even though they were invited to.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nIn the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nIn the second programme, a patient describes his life as 'satanic' and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country's most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\nclick on the links below to get full-size images &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/08be152fef1861cf728abda07f3f1b9e8bf0e89a.jpg&quot;
