This is an alternate, ancient realm\npeopled by the peaceful, Neanderthal-esque Pakuni tribe, as well as the evil lizard\ncreatures known as the Sleestaks, which only come out at night and are afraid of fire.\nThe family also encounters a number of dinosaurs--both friendly and otherwise--\nthe Abominable Snowman, and even Medusa. The puppetering effects of creators\nSid &amp; Marty Krofft were considered fairly revolutionary at the time, and although\nspecial effect techniques have vastly improved since then, the strength of the storylines\ncombined with a highly endearing quality have given the show a solid cult following.\nThis set presents the complete series in its entirety.\n\n \nCredits\n\nCast: Kathy Coleman, Spencer Milligan, Wesley Eure\n\nVideo info \n\ncodec: xvid \nbitrate: 930kb/s APPROX \nfps: 23.97 \nresolution : 512x384 \nsubtitles: NONE \n\nAudio info \n\nbitrate: 128 kb/s (stereo) CBR \nFS: 48000 Hz \nlanguage(s): English\n\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nI will seed as MUCH as possible. \n\nPLEASE SEED after you download! \nDon't just download and run it is not fair to others! \n\nENJOY! \n\n*******************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59332e29f174e2641eff305e5f95ce60b7c313e6","amp;dn":"Land+of+the+Lost+-+The+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59332e29f174e2641eff305e5f95ce60b7c313e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,51,46,41,241,116,226,100,30,255,48,94,95,149,206,96,183,195,19,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
