Your Windows registry will be always clean and correct. Registry First Aid scans registry for orphan file/folder references, invalid font references, obsolete Start Menu items, invalid fonts, shared DLLs, application paths and more... Registry First Aid finds these files or folders on your drives that may have been moved from their initial locations, and then corrects your registry entries to match the located files or folders. In addition, if your registry has links to files of deleted applications, Registry First Aid will find these invalid entries and remove them from your registry. With Registry First Aid, your Windows registry will be always clean and correct, helping your programs load faster and speeding up your computer.\n\nNot all software un-installations do a complete job leaving behind numerous nagging file references in the Windows registry pointing to files that no longer exist. In time, you can end up with hundreds of these files that may slow down your computer and cause software to lock up, requiring a hard reboot of your computer.\nAlso, if you've moved your programs from one drive to another, you can break the file links that a program needs. Registry First Aid will find these files and folders that you've moved on your hard drive and help you correct the registry entries that point to them.\n\nNew in version 7.0.0\n\n    * new interface;\n\n    * new enhanced fast and smart registry scanning algorithm;\n\n    + detecting new error category: bad ActiveX/COM registrations;\n\n    + new option to ignore &quot;no permission to modify&quot; registry entries that Vista has many;\n\n    + in addition to system registry backup Registry First Aid Platinum now creates separate backup of every registry file;\n\n    + easy managing and restoring registry backup files;\n\n    * enhanced registry compression/defragmentation;\n\n    + show summary compression size and ratio;\n\n    + store and show statistics about found/corrected problems, registry defragmentation sizes, last searches, stored registry snapshots, available plugins for Registry Management (Platinum version only), full registry backups and small .reg backup files created;\n\n    + new view added: view all found errors at one screen;\n\n    * when &quot;View by filter&quot; is selected, filter options will not cover list of errors - they will be opened in separate window;\n\n    + error category buttons now can be placed horizontally or vertically - switch by a double-click on any butto\n\n\nPlz Seed...\n\nThnXX...\n\nmAnaV...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1abe1ae8074c8aa6928268ffb15e38b5f5070647","amp;dn":"Registry+First+Aid+Platinum+v7.0.0.1648+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1abe1ae8074c8aa6928268ffb15e38b5f5070647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,190,26,232,7,76,138,166,146,130,104,255,177,94,56,181,245,7,6,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
