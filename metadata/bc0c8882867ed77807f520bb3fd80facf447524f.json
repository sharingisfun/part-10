The whispers of history's ghosts settled across Beale Street for another day's work. And Furry played and sang again.&quot;\n\nRecorded March 5, 1969 in Furry's apartment near Fourth &amp; Beale Streets, Memphis. Furry performed with his guitar, in bed, leg off.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc0c8882867ed77807f520bb3fd80facf447524f","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Walter+%5C%27Furry%5C%27+Lewis+-+Blues+Magician","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc0c8882867ed77807f520bb3fd80facf447524f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,12,136,130,134,126,215,120,7,245,32,187,63,216,15,172,244,71,82,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
