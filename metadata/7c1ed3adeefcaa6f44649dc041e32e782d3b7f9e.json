It was the second title in in THQ's MotoGP series and based the 2002 MotoGP season. Players could take part in a single race on three choosable circuits or participate in a full season, eventually unlocking more circuits to be raced on. Also featured in the game is a stunt mode where the player race a one lap performing different stunts as wheelies, burnouts and powerslides for points. Points are also rewarded when overtaking another rider, driving clean sections, or ramming other riders so they crash. However, recently gained points are lost if the player drives outside the track or crashes. Also if the player fails to reach goal within the timelimit, all rewarded points are lost. The menu theme music is Psynn 2 by Shawn Hargreaves, who created a new version of Psynn, version used in MotoGP.\n\n\nCircuits\nThe game features 16 official MotoGP circuits based on the 2002 MotoGP season and 1 generic circuits, there are 17 total circuits are:\n\nNo. Country Circuit                                           Length(m) Turns \nTraining  Great Britain Sheridan Training Circuit               4379    13 \n1  Japan Suzuka                                                 5859    20 \n2  South Africa Phakisa                                         4242    14 \n3  Spain Jerez                                                  4423    13 \n4  France Le Mans                                               4180    13 \n5  Italy Mugello                                                5245    14 \n6  Spain Catalunya                                              4727    13 \n7  Netherlands Assen                                            6027    23 \n8  Great Britain Donington                                      4023    11 \n9  Germany Sachsenring                                          3704    14 \n10  Czech Republic Brno                                         5403    14 \n11  Portugal Estoril                                            4182    13 \n12  Brazil Rio                                                  4933    12 \n13  Japan Motegi                                                4801    14 \n14  Malaysia Sepang                                             5543    15 \n15  Australia Phillip Island                                    4448    12 \n16  Spain Valencia                                              4005    14 \n\n Riders\nThe game features 22 official MotoGP riders based on the 2002 MotoGP season are:\n\n Repsol Honda \n \nValentino Rossi\n Tohru Ukawa\n\n Yamaha \n Max Biaggi\n Carlos Checa\n\n Aprilia Racing \n Regis Laconi\n\n Telefonica Movistar Suzuki \n Kenny Roberts, Jr.\n Sete Gibernau\n Akira Ryo\n\n Pons Grand Prix \n Alex Barros\n Loris Capirossi\n\n Gresini Grand Prix \n Daijiro Kato\n\n Tech 3 \n Olivier Jacque\n Shinya Nakano\n\n d'Antin Team \n Norifumi Abe\n Jose Luis Cardoso\n\n WCM \n Garry McCoy\n John Hopkins\n\n Pramac Racing \n Tetsuya Harada\n\n Roberts Grand Prix \n Nobuatsu Aoki\n Jeremy McWilliams\n\n Kanemoto Grand Prix \n Jurgen van den Goorbergh\n\n Kawasaki \n Andrew Pitt\n\n===================================================================================\n\nInstructions-\n\n1.Open the archive rld-motogp2-001.\n\n2.
