YFW was all about the rage and misery of young, explosive love, presented with Weezer-like hooks. Deja Entendu isn?t really over it yet; lead singer Jesse Lacey still sounds damaged and full of self-loathing on mopey, post-Smiths pop like &quot;The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot.&quot; But amidst the Jimmy Eat World choruses are experiments with sudden dynamic shifts and style (like Lacey channeling Adam Duritz for &quot;Play Crack The Sky&quot;), along with ruminations about the misery of cancer (&quot;Guernica&quot;). If Deja Entendu sounds like the work of musicians discovering their talents, it's also about learning that desperate heartache isn't just about girls who don?t call back. --Matthew Cooke \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4adf780ca228ca920f65c459c540c052d1da47a9","amp;dn":"Brand+New+-+Deja+Entendu%28adonis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4adf780ca228ca920f65c459c540c052d1da47a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,223,120,12,162,40,202,146,15,101,196,89,197,64,192,82,209,218,71,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
