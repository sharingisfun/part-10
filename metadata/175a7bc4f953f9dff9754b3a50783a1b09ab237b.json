Informal discussion with Ann Guinan encouraged me to expand upon this research. Thus I have ventured into comparative analyses with other art forms originating from different sources and historical periods, and tried to examine through text and art the probable signiÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cance behind the selection of speciÃ¯Â¬ï¿½c motifs and designs. Central to this study have been the wall paintings discovered at Til Barsip. I amgrateful toAnnie Caubet, ConservateurGÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral duDÃƒÂ©partement des AntiquitÃƒÂ©s Orientales,MusÃƒÂ©e du Louvre, who generously made available to me the color slides of CavroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s renderings of the Til Barsip paintings. During the time I spent at the museum in 1997, I also beneÃ¯Â¬ï¿½ted from the kind cooperation of Elisabeth Fontan, Conservateur en Chef du DÃƒÂ©partement des AntiquitÃƒÂ©s Orientales, with whom I discussed and examined several of the original works by Cavro, once they were rolled out on the Ã¯Â¬â€šoor of the storeroom. I must add a special mention of gratitude to Lydie Shufro, who volunteered to read a late draft of my manuscript and suggested many improvements on the phrasing of the text. Additional research and access to volumes not readily obtainable required the use of the facilities of the Humanities and Social Sciences Library at the New York Public Library, with the assistance of the staff of the Asian and Middle Eastern Division, and of the Wilbour Library at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York.
