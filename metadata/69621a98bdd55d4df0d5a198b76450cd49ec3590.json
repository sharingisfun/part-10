Speed metal? Ever since the shock turn of the last album's lead single 'Spanish Sahara' - the most WTF moment since Kid A (not least in Oxford) and a contender for this century's best video starring an animal carcass - trying to work out what a new Foals record will sound like is now one of music's mightiest puzzles. Just as group chief Yannis Philippakis told DS the other week, &quot;You can peg a band quite quickly, usually.&quot; Not his, though.\n\nAnd 'Inhaler', the first single from Holy Fire, we didn't see coming; hard-boiled cuffs and greasy, pushy guitars trigger the heaviest Foals have ever sounded. Yannis may be squealing for some personal space (&quot;I lost the beat, I cannot breathe, don't follow me&quot;), but when their noise is this frantic, his claustrophobia is comforting in its familiarity. 'My Number', however, is so gloriously catchy, you could almost forgive trolling will.i.am and repeatedly warning: &quot;This is the future of disco.
