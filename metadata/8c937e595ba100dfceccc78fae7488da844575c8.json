It includes relevant science on brain trauma, advice on how to better deal with concussions at all levels of sports, and some of the tragic stories from sports such as football, hockey and soccer that have now been determined to be due to concussions. \n\nWIkipedia: Head Games is a revealing documentary about the silent concussion crisis in American sports. Athletes from the professional to the youth levels share their personal struggles in dealing with the devastating and long-term effects of concussions, an epidemic fueled by the 'leave everything on the field' culture so prominent in American sport. Inspired by events from the book Head Games written by former Ivy League football star and WWE wrestler Christopher Nowinski, and featuring interviews with Nowinski, Bob Costas (NBC Sports), Keith Primeau (NHL All-Star), Cindy Parlow Cone (Olympic Gold Medalist, Women's Soccer), and many more, the film contrasts eye-opening evidence and cutting-edge science on head trauma from the nation's leading medical experts with first-hand accounts from the athletes, coaches and parents who must tread the difficult balance between sports excellence and basic self-preservation. Head Games exposes viewers to one of the leading public health issues of our time, raising the question: &quot;How much of you are you willing to lose for a game?&quot;\n\nPlease check out other posts of documentaries, Rifftrax, Star Trek Enterprise, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c937e595ba100dfceccc78fae7488da844575c8","amp;dn":"Head+Games+%282012%29+480p+2ch+%28sports+and+brain+injuries%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c937e595ba100dfceccc78fae7488da844575c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,147,126,89,91,161,0,223,206,204,199,143,174,116,136,218,132,69,117,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
