With the assistance of the South African Government the aliens (&quot;prawns&quot; as the people refer to them) are inhabiting an area known as District 9 unable to leave the planet. Although far more advanced in robotics, biotechnology and weaponry than humans the prawns remarkably don't wage a full scale war with their human counterparts. They simply seem to be waiting until a solution can be found to go back to their spaceship and must endure the hardships they have come to realize on Earth.\r\n  \r\nStarring: Sharlto Copley, Nathalie Boltt, John Sumner, Jason Cope, \r\n\r\nVideo\r\nCodec: H.264\r\nFormat: .mp4\r\nBitrate: 1252 kbps\r\nResolution: 720x404 (Original)\r\nAspect: 16x9 (Widescreen)\r\nFrame Rate: 29 frames/sec.\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nCodec: .aac\r\nBitrate: 256 kbps\r\nChannels: 6\r\nSample: 44 kHz\r\nVolume: 100%\r\n\r\nTriStar Pictures\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004756410cbcb826f6bfb597b94a019374b43ac1","amp;dn":"District+9_%282009%29%5BH.264.AC3.DVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004756410cbcb826f6bfb597b94a019374b43ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,71,86,65,12,188,184,38,246,191,181,151,185,74,1,147,116,180,58,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
