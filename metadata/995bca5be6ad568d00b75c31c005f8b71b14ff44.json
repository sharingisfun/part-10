The program uses advanced file recovery techniques that make it possible to recover files damaged by viruses and spyware, undelete files located on damaged or deleted partitions, and even restore files after a quick drive format. The program supports most digital cameras, camcorders and memory cards and guarantees the best possible results. \n\nAuslogics File Recovery allows you to search for deleted files in a simple and intuitive way, as it supports search by file name and filtering. You can easily preview search results and recover exactly what you need, be it documents, photos, music or videos. \n\nAuslogics File Recovery is one of the most reliable recovery products on the market today. Auslogics File Recovery can not only undelete your files, but also help you to recover your computer in case it experiences Windows failure. The program is supplied with a feature that allows you to create disk images, which means that you will never need a separate backup and disaster recovery solution. \n\n\nFeatures:\nRecover Any File:\nOften we delete a file, then clear the Recycle Bin and the file is lost. Software programs sometimes crash during a transaction with a file and this can accidentally delete the file. Viruses are another common cause of data loss. This is where File Recovery comes to rescue. With this program you can recover deleted documents, music, digital photos, applications and all other files from your hard drive, USB memory sticks or digital camera memory cards.\n\nFlexible Search System:\nYou can take advantage of the flexible search options to minimize file recovery time. The program allows you to select the drives you want to scan for deleted files and specify the types of files you are searching for. If you remember when the deleted files were last modified, you can specify a date range. In addition to that, you can search deleted files by name.\n\nRestore Data from Lost Partitions:\nFile Recovery can locate the information about deleted portions of the disk, so that you will be able to recover files from a lost partition. This even applies to deleted portions of the disk that got reallocated for other partitions. File Recovery also detects files that were on the disk before it got formatted. And if it was just a quick format of a partition, the program will be able to recover these files.\n\nSecurely Erase Files:\nFile Shredder is a valuable feature that should be used by anyone who wishes to ensure immediate and complete deletion of a confidential file from the current disk drive. Few users realize that files deleted in a usual way can be restored by powerful recovery programs such as Auslogics File Recovery even when the Recycle Bin is emptied. Files deleted with File Shredder cannot be restored by any file recovery software.\n\nSupport for Any Types of Drives And Devices:\nAuslogics File Recovery guarantees professional recovery of all file types from all kinds of media. With the program you can recover files deleted from your PC, external hard drives and USB sticks in a quick and easy way. The program also supports all types of digital cameras' and camcorders' memory cards, so any recently deleted picture or movie from your digital camera can be restored as well.\n\nCreate an Image of Your Disk:\nTake advantage of the program's useful feature that allows you to create a complete disk image. The disk image file is the exact image of the logical drive along with all the information contained on the disk, including deleted files. This option allows you to recover files from the disk image later on while continuing working with the logical drive. Having an image of your drive is also an excellent way to back up all your data.\n\nPreview Files Before Recovering:\nAnother major benefit of Auslogics File Recovery is its advanced preview options. The program allows you to preview photos, videos, documents and PDF files right from the program, while browsing through the list of files found during the scan. This option will help you to quickly find files you are searching for and decide which of them need to be recovered.\n\nWipe Free Disk Space:\nSimilar to File Shredder, Disk Wiper securely deletes files from your disk drive. The difference is that this wizard will wipe the free space on your drive, so that any traces of deleted files are gone for good. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to select specific files to delete - the tool only affects files that have already been deleted. Use this feature to be sure that none of your previously deleted files can ever be restored.\n\n\nRequirements:\nOperating System:\nWin 8/8.1 (32 or 64 bit), Win 7 (32 or 64 bit),\nVista SP2 (32-bit only), XP SP3 (32-bit only)\nHard disk space: 15 MB\nMemory: 256 MB\nRecommended screen resolution: 800x600\n\n\nWhat's New:\n*fixed a critical bug that could cause significant performance loss on certain systems running Windows 8.1\n*improved program stability\n*improved program launch speed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995bca5be6ad568d00b75c31c005f8b71b14ff44","amp;dn":"Auslogics+File+Recovery+4.5.3.0+Final+%2B+Crack-P2P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995bca5be6ad568d00b75c31c005f8b71b14ff44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,91,202,91,230,173,86,141,0,183,92,49,192,5,248,183,27,20,255,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
