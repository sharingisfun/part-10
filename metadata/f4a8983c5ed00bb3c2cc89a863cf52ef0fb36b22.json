Each title was packaged as a digipak, containing the full original artwork. On each of the titles, and on each of the layers, the remastered sound was spectacular, a considerable upgrade from the initial CD pressings. Five of these titles -- Another Side of Bob Dylan, Blonde on Blonde, Bringing It All Back Home, Blood on the Tracks, Love and Theft -- also had 5.1 Surround Sound mixes. Since many Dylan fans are fanatical collectors and were likely to purchase all 15, Columbia/Legacy also released a box set containing all the masters. There is no extra packaging to the set -- just the box itself, a cardboard slipcase containing replicas of studio master tapes -- so collectors that somehow bought the 15 titles without realizing that the box exists aren't really missing out on anything special. However, the set is an excellent, convenient way to pick up all the titles at once, which is what most Dylan fans are likely to do anyway. \n\n\nRelease Date\n September 16, 2003 \n\nDuration\n12:04:18 \n\nGenre\n\nPop/Rock\nFolk\n\n\nStyles\n\nAlbum Rock\nCountry-Rock\nFolk-Rock\nPolitical Folk\nPsychedelic/Garage\nRock &amp; Roll\nSinger/Songwriter\nBlues-Rock\nContemporary Folk\nContemporary Pop/Rock\n\nAlbumlist:\n1963 - The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (CH 90321 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1964 - Another Side Of Bob Dylan (CH 90327 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1965 - Bringing It All Back Home (CH 90326 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1965 - Highway 61 Revisited (CH 90324 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1966 - Blonde On Blonde (CH 90325 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1967 - John Wesley Harding (CH 90320 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1969 - Nashville Skyline (CH 90319 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1974 - Planet Waves (CH 90339 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1975 - Blood On The Tracks (CH 90323 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1976 - Desire (CH 90318 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1978 - Street-Legal (CH 90338 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1979 - Slow Train Coming (CH 90322 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1983 - Infidels (CH 90317 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n1989 - Oh Mercy (CH 90316 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n2001 - Love And Theft (CH 90340 2003 Remaster SACD-R)\n2003 - The Reissue Series Sampler (COL 512556 6 SACD-R)\n\n\nPerfectly played on Foobar2000 with &quot;foo_input_sacd&quot; plugin.\n For those Mac users wishing to play ISO, SACD format: see Audirvana Plus\n - Make sure you've configured it properly (check up the player settings).\n\nP.S.
