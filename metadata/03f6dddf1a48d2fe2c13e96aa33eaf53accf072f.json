He picked up guitar and harmonica as a boy around that rough and tumble port town. Helena was considered ground zero by the Delta Blues community thanks to KFFA radio's King Biscuit Time program that aired daily and was hosted by &quot;Sunshine&quot; Sonny Payne. In the early 1950s Frank hooked up with drummer Sam Carr, who also happened to be the son of legendary guitarist Robert Nighthawk (AKA Robert Lee McCoy). In 1962 they expanded to three pieces and added guitarist/bassist Jack Johnson. The three began performing as Frank Frost &amp; The Nighthawks, and later as the now legendary Jelly Roll Kings. They quickly became one of the most popular juke joint bands in the delta, recording for Sam Phillips' Phillips International label. In the late 80's, following a lengthy and up and down career, Jack Johnson dropped from the Kings, only to re-unite in 1997 for the fabulous Fat Possum release of Off Yonders Wall, only to leave again afterwards. The recordings on this release hail from 1998 when veteran producer Fred James took recording gear to Helena to capture the majesty of Frank and Sam at Sonny Boy Hall, coupled with five live 1993 tracks from the King Biscuit Blues Festival.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
