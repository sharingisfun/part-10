Considering that initial copies of The PirateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gospel were given away to friends in hand-sewn covers just a few years ago, this is not only quite a leap, but a well-deserved one.\n\nGeoff Travis, founder of Rough Trade Records, says ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlela Diane is a real American Songwriter. Both flinty and beautiful. She draws from a tradition that might include Sandy Denny and Karen Dalton and she suffers not a jot in comparisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/22/alela-diane/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/22/alela-diane/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f8f6ffd58dbb7f244024964b26fb5faacec0e7","amp;dn":"Alela+Diane...To+Be+Still+%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f8f6ffd58dbb7f244024964b26fb5faacec0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,248,246,255,213,141,187,127,36,64,36,150,75,38,251,95,170,206,192,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
