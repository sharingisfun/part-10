Between 1968 and 1977 bands like Neu!, Can, Faust and Kraftwerk would look beyond western rock and roll to create some of the most original and uncompromising music ever heard. They shared one common goal - a forward-looking desire to transcend Germany's gruesome past - but that didn't stop the music press in war-obsessed Britain from calling them Krautrock.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nf10k&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nf10k&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 132 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nRunTime Per Part: 58 mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 728 MB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT availabled at MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-T (BBC4)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afe05269947b8a3827feb277c75cb356d4aa4df","amp;dn":"BBC+Krautrock+The+Rebirth+of+Germany+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afe05269947b8a3827feb277c75cb356d4aa4df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,254,5,38,153,71,184,163,130,127,235,39,124,117,203,53,109,74,164,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
