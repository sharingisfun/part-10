Information Overload supersedes normal, rational thought structures, forcing deviation into less restrictive mental procedures of so-called 'mental illness'. SPK is trying to be a voice for those individuals condemned to the slow decay of mental hospitals and chemical / electro / surgical therapy, without fetishising them into blatant entertainment product. 'SONIC FOR MANICS' aims to be a vehicle for sharing mental experiences through sound.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n...so, I went looking for a SPK discography torrent.. and all I turned up was one with 4 cd's..! Uber-Lame-O.. I figured, hell, these guys are industrial pioneers.. there ought to be a discog. already to go.. no work for me.. just find it a d/l it.. .. (crickets churping...)... now dammit! Must I put EVERY Industrial Discography together?!! Or is anyone out there gonna pitch in?! I'd like some referrals, suggestions, links to some good and thorough industrial discog's that I might not have tackled yet (like, Liar's Rosebush.. excellent suggestion.. ) I know there's alot of good people on Demonoid.. I get alot of love here where as ThePirateBay won't even get a thank you in 10 torrents.. it's a thankless job sometimes, but it shouldn't be all the time.. help me out here friends.. I'm running out of ideas on what to download.... [that was originally a Demonoid message and torrent.. I feel like TPB has been failing me for awhile.. how about somebody suprise me with a fine collection of something Industrial that I might not have covered!!?? At least a thank you is in order.. if you appritiate the music in any way....]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ca2dd28cbdc15842154fca298a03dc847b384d","amp;dn":"SPK+Discography+%2830+releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ca2dd28cbdc15842154fca298a03dc847b384d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,202,45,210,140,189,193,88,66,21,79,202,41,138,3,220,132,123,56,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
