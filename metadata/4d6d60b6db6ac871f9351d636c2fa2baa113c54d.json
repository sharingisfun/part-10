More than 90% of all face-to-face communication is non-verbal, \nand the silent messages of body language often reveal more than the spoken word in conveying true feelings, highly influencing first impressions \nand the self-image we project to others. This guide includes practical exercises to enhance understanding of non-verbal communication, and \ncovers such aspects of body language as special features of the workplace and non-verbal communication in international contexts.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d6d60b6db6ac871f9351d636c2fa2baa113c54d","amp;dn":"Understand+Body+Language%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d6d60b6db6ac871f9351d636c2fa2baa113c54d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,109,96,182,219,106,200,113,249,53,29,99,108,47,162,186,161,19,197,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
