Some issues are told from the viewpoint of heroes, some from the more typical vantage point of average people, others from villains and shady criminals. Stories also vary greatly in length, from one issue to sixteen in the case of the current story arc, Dark Age, whose main viewpoint remains that of Charles and Royal Williams, two brothers in their early adult years living in Astro City. As another interesting twist, this story is set in the 1970s, when some super-heroes were declining in popularity, due to general mistrust of authority figures, along with the more violent, gritty tactics that some super-heroes were practicing. Hence the notion of a &quot;Dark Age.&quot;  The essential hook of Astro City is that it explores how people - both ordinary people and the heroes and villains themselves - react to living in their world. \n\nWritten by Kurt Busiek, the series is co-created and illustrated by Brent Anderson with character designs and painted covers by Alex Ross. \n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:321a87affa0e1220a7480ac9a6d75519866e1880","amp;dn":"Astro+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"321a87affa0e1220a7480ac9a6d75519866e1880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,26,135,175,250,14,18,32,167,72,10,201,166,215,85,25,134,110,24,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
