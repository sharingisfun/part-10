The various components of language -- vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar -- are all learned together without rote memorization and drills. Using a unique method of memory recall developed by renowned linguist, Dr. Paul Pimsleur, the programs teach listeners to combine words and phrases to express themselves the way native speakers do. By listening and responding to thirty minute recorded lessons, students easily and effectively achieve spoken proficiency.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d300e165dcb0f5d5080ffb67259778b5f44f74dd","amp;dn":"Pimsleur+-+Essential+Spanish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d300e165dcb0f5d5080ffb67259778b5f44f74dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,0,225,101,220,176,245,213,8,15,251,103,37,151,120,181,244,79,116,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
