The results were originally released as a double-LP and have been reissued as two CDs with over an hour of new music added. Jones' pianoless quartet features two masterful saxophonists (both doubling on tenor and soprano) who at the time sounded very close to John Coltrane. Dave Liebman and Steve Grossman were among the first young saxophonists not closely associated with Coltane who used his style as a starting point in their search for their own musical identities. Their high-powered and sometimes rowdy flights are consistently stimulating. With Gene Perla's alert, sensitive, and inventive bass holding the unit together, Elvin Jones was able to play as free as he desired. The first volume (taken from three sets at the Lighthouse) has six fiery selections, four of which were previously unreleased.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Introduction Bill Chappell - Announcer Rick Holmes\n 02 - Fancy Free (Live At The Lighthouse Cafe, CA 1972)\n 03 - Sambra (Live At The Lighthouse Cafe, CA 1972)\n 04 - The Children, Save The Children (Live At The Lighthouse Cafe, CA 1972)\n 05 - Happy Birthday Greeting (Live At The Lighthouse Cafe, CA 1972)\n 06 - Sweet Mama (Live At The Lighthouse Cafe, CA 1972)\n 07 - New Breed (Live At The Lighthouse Cafe, CA 1972)\n 08 - My Ship (Live At The Lighthouse Cafe, CA 1972)\n\nMusicians:\n Elvin Jones - drums\n Steve Grossman - tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone\n Dave Liebman - tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute\n Gene Perla - bass\n\nElvin Jones - Merry-Go-Round (1972/2014)\n FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/96 kHz | Time - 32:09 minutes | 750 MB\nStudio Master, Official Digital Download | Artwork: Front cover\n\n Drummer Elvin Jones' 1972 Blue Note studio album. The record features an all-star cast including David Liebman, Joe Farrell and Chick Corea, among other notable musicians. Merry-Go-Round is a recording filled with originals including Chick Corea's &quot;La Fiesta&quot; and David Liebman's &quot;Brite Piece&quot;.\n\n\n This is one of Joe Farrell's finest recordings. Switching between tenor, soprano and flute, Farrell had to be good because he was joined in the pianoless trio by bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones. The group performs two standards, three Garrison originals and one by Farrell; it is a tossup as to who takes honors. Farrell is in consistently creative form but Garrison's occasional solos and Jones's polyrhythmic accompaniment are also noteworthy.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - 'Round Town\n 02 - Brite Piece\n 03 - Lungs\n 04 - A Time For Love\n 05 - Tergiversation\n 06 - La Fiesta\n 07 - The Children's Merry-Go-Round March\n 08 - Who's Afraid...\n\n Produced by George Butler.
