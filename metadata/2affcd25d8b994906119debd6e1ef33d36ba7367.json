Only the submissive yet steely Grace burns for marriage; the sleekly sophisticated Edda burns to be a doctor, the down-to-earth but courageous Tufts burns never to marry, and the too-beautiful, internally scarred Kitty burns for a love free from male ownership.\nTurbulent times, terrible torments, but the four magnificent Latimer sisters, each so different, love as women do: with tenderness as well as passion, and with hearts roomy enough to hold their men, their children, their careers and their sisters.\nGenre: Historical Fiction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2affcd25d8b994906119debd6e1ef33d36ba7367","amp;dn":"Bittersweet+-+Colleen+McCullough.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2affcd25d8b994906119debd6e1ef33d36ba7367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,255,205,37,216,185,148,144,97,25,222,189,110,30,243,61,54,186,115,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
