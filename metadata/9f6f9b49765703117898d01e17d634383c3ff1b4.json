The story followed from the Onslaught Saga where Magneto's mind and Charles Xavier's subconsciousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ merge and create the entity known as Onslaught.  Most of the core non-mutant superhero teams (the Fantastic Four, a number of the Avengers and Bruce Banner), along with Doctor Doom sacrificed themselves in order to help destroy Onslaught. \n\nThis led to a great amount of distrust being harbored toward all mutantkind.  Graydon Creed, a presidential candidate and outspoken proponent of mutant hatred, was assassinated by what was meant to look like an energy blast of some kind. This escalated humanity's festering feelings toward mutants.\n\nThe fallout of both of these events served as a springboard for the man known as Bastion to suggest to the government that in order to keep the nation safe from the growing mutant threat, they capture and exterminate all mutants.  Bastion, along with the aid of his newly constructed Prime Sentinels, was given approval to implement this plan, which was dubbed &quot;Operation: Zero Tolerance&quot;. \n\nThe main storyline was in the issues listed below, but I have included further issues that build upon and conclude the story.\n\nPrelude:\nUncanny X-Men 343 (1997/04)\nGeneration X 25 (1997/03)\nUncanny X-Men 344 (1997/05)\nGeneration X 26 (1997/04)\nGeneration X 27 (1997/05)\nX-Men 64 (1997/05)\nX-Force 67 (1997/06)\n\nPrologue:\nX-Men 65 (1997/06)\n\nMain Body:\nCable 45 (1997/08)\nGeneration X 29 (1997/08)\nUncanny X-Men 346 (1997/08)\nWolverine 115 (1997/08)\nX-Force 68 (1997/08)\nX-Men 66 (1997/08)\nCable 46 (1997/09)\nGeneration X 30 (1997/09)\nWolverine 116 (1997/09)\nX-Force 69 (1997/09)\nX-Men 67 (1997/09)\nCable 47 (1997/10)\nGeneration X 31 (1997/10)\nWolverine 117 (1997/10)\nX-Men 68 (1997/10)\n\nConclusion:\nX-Men 69 (1997/11)\nWolverine 118 (1997/11)\n\nAftermath:\nX-Men 70 (1997/12)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f6f9b49765703117898d01e17d634383c3ff1b4","amp;dn":"Operation+Zero+Tolerance+-+1997+X-Men+Crossover+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f6f9b49765703117898d01e17d634383c3ff1b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,111,155,73,118,87,3,17,120,152,208,30,23,214,52,56,60,63,241,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
