A cast of Americans get mixed up in the plot and all become suspects under the intense scrutiny of the police inspector, played by Giancarlo Giannini. Phoebe (Sean Young) is a jilted lover trying to make it on her own in Rome. Julian Peters (Richard Lewis) is an unemployed actor who is reluctantly paired with Pheobe when they find Madame Van Dugen&amp;#039;s missing dachshund, Napoleon. Augie Morosco (John Candy) is a gambling addict willing to pay thousands for the dog as a present to his wife. Jim Belushi and Cybill Shepard play an unhappily married couple visiting Europe for business and pleasure.\n  George Hamilton is great as the local gigolo. Throughout the movie, the American tourists stumble over themselves, telling lies for no reason and digging themselves deeper into a hole with the French police inspector. In a stunning climax, the inspector gathers them all in one room and gets them to expose the truth about the night Madame Van Dugen was murdered.\n\n  Starring: Richard Lewis, Sean Young, James Belushi, John Candy, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton.\n\n  Directed by: Eugene Levy.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 35min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 640 x 480\n\n  Frame Rate: 29fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d82636549d879f4668cfeb4f927f0932112f8d04","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Crime+%281992%29+%28Richard+Lewis%2C+Sean+Young%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d82636549d879f4668cfeb4f927f0932112f8d04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,38,54,84,157,135,159,70,104,207,235,79,146,127,9,50,17,47,141,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
