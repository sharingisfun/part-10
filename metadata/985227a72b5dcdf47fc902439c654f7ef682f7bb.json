What would you do with that knowledge?\n\nWell, two questionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but you get the point.  What would you do?  Would you share it with your friends who go to the club regularly, smoke weed and candy flip every weekend?  How about that hardworking family man you know that risks his ass every night just to ensure that his baby has some new shoes?  WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you like to have a dope mansion like Scarface?  Tired of selling dimes and nickel bags?  CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a job Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcuz youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got too many tattoos or got a prison record?\n\nCould you make use of a couple more dogecoins in your wallet, singlehandedly sending itsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ exchange rate to the moon?\n\nwhat do you think might happen as a result?\n\nmaybe you might wanna give this short story a look, if you're curious. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:985227a72b5dcdf47fc902439c654f7ef682f7bb","amp;dn":"silk+road+mocha+-+a+bitcoin+love+story.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"985227a72b5dcdf47fc902439c654f7ef682f7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,82,39,167,43,93,205,244,127,201,2,67,156,101,79,126,246,130,247,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
