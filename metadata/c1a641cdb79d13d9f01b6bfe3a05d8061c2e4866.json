As the inquiry unfolds in present day through separate interrogations, the two former detectives narrate the story of their investigation, reopening unhealed wounds, and drawing into question their supposed solving of a bizarre ritualistic murder in 1995. The timelines braid and converge in 2012 as each man is pulled back into a world they believed they'd left behind. In learning about each other and their killer, it becomes clear that darkness lives on both sides of the law.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a641cdb79d13d9f01b6bfe3a05d8061c2e4866","amp;dn":"True+Detective+Complete+Season+01+HDTV+%7BKNIX%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a641cdb79d13d9f01b6bfe3a05d8061c2e4866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,166,65,205,183,157,19,217,240,27,107,254,58,5,216,6,28,46,72,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
