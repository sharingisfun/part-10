In his day he was universally praised. When Hamsun won the Nobel Prize for literature, Thomas Mann remarked that Ã¢â‚¬Å“never has the Nobel Prize been awarded to one so worthy of it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Henry Miller called Hamsun Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Dickens of my generation,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Charles Bukowski called him &quot;the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest writer.&quot; Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote with respect to Hamsun's novel &quot;Hunger&quot; that Ã¢â‚¬Å“all modern literature of this century finds its source here.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIt is impossible to understand the 20th century novel without reading Knut Hamsun. But Hamsun's work has been studiously ignored by the literary world ever since World War II, for Hamsun was an enemy of the modern world, an enemy of deracinated cosmopolitan hedonism - and hence an enemy of the literary establishment.  The establishment, intolerant of opposition, did its best to stifle his work, demonstrating yet again that the modern cultural movement which now goes under the name liberalism is far more illiberal than any &quot;authoritarianism&quot; which preceded it.\n\n\nThis torrent is a collection of Hamsun's work, and includes the following texts:\n\nGrowth of the Soil\nHunger\nPan\nLook back on Happiness\nMysteries\nShallow Soil\nWanderers\nDreamers\n\nEssays on Hamsun by Kerry Bolton and Mark Deavin are also included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4239b8aec62d8fb7e1b4187d41f048debb6aa9f","amp;dn":"Knut+Hamsun+book+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4239b8aec62d8fb7e1b4187d41f048debb6aa9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,35,155,138,236,98,216,251,126,27,65,135,212,31,4,141,235,182,170,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
