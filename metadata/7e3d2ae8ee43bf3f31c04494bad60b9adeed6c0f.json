After using DVD Decrypter/Mode/ISO/Write to convert each to the original format they can be played displaying the embedded closed captions (subtitles).\n\nMy next upload will contain the broken down working copy of Middlemarch which I will (or you will) use to write/compose subtitle files .ssa/.srt using the stripped closed captions in text form.\n\nIt's going to take a long time. This movie is six hours compared to two hours for The Woman in White, which I am now trying to write.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e3d2ae8ee43bf3f31c04494bad60b9adeed6c0f","amp;dn":"Middlemarch+%281994%29+TV+2++ISO+file+w%2FENG+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e3d2ae8ee43bf3f31c04494bad60b9adeed6c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,61,42,232,238,67,191,63,49,192,68,148,186,214,11,154,222,237,108,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
