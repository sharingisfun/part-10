I saw a *.NRG file out there but not everyone uses Nero. I converted it for you. I use Torq version 1.0.7 and it works perfectly with my CDI 500's. Just download the ISO file and burn it with any program that will allow you to use ISO format, which should be about all of them.\n\nThis is perfect if you have already purchased the program and you happen to scratch up one of your Torq CD's. This is the Image File to make a new one!\n\nKeep in mind, it has to be an image file for it to work! Do not be fooled by torrents with Torq CD MP3. Mp3 can work for *some* players, but for most it will cause you problems! ISO's of the CD's work for everyone, all the time!\n\nEveryone, keep the new music on the scene High Quality! I'll be sure to do the same.\n\nEnjoi!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128ffeba27a008ab585523a985ec921c1febac58","amp;dn":"M-Audio+Torq+Timecoded+CD+-+ISO+File","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128ffeba27a008ab585523a985ec921c1febac58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,143,254,186,39,160,8,171,88,85,35,169,133,236,146,28,31,235,172,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
