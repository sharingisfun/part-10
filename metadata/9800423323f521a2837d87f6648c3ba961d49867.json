Turville-Petre\nEdited by N.F. Blake\nOriginally published in 1962\n\nThe book contains a lengthy introduction with historical background, maps etc. And then goes on with both original Icelandic and English translation of The Saga of the Jomsvikings, or the JÃƒÂ³msvÃƒÂ­kinga Saga - and finishes off with some appendixes, an index and so forth.\n\n---\n\nAdditional comment:\nThis is a re-touch of an old existing PDF I found on some while ago. I cropped, removed some stains, sharpened and ran &quot;ClearScan&quot;/OCR on it. Quality is thus significantly improved, and file size is reduced to about half of the original one.\nSo, this one should work very well with handheld devices of any screen size, as well as for reading on your desktop or even printing if you will.
