At the same time, the government established the Recently Armed Police Taskforce, whose methods are exterminating criminals rather than arresting them.\n\nThe story opens with Kyohei Tachibana, a student at a culinary arts school with dreams of someday becoming a patissier, motorcycling down an inner city street and becoming caught up in a shoot-out between a mysterious white-haired woman and a couple of gangsters. Kyohei escapes unharmed and ends up working as a cook for Jo, Meg, Amy, and Sei in an effort to gather up enough money to travel to France. The girls, ranging in ages of eleven to nineteen, turn out to be pseudo-mercenary agents for a larger international group known as Bai Lan.\n\nBurst Angel focuses on the group as they investigate a series of mutated human monsters with odd glowing brains that cause various amount of mayhem in Tokyo.\n\nThe mkv files in this torrent contain the following file types:\n\nFormat                       : Matroska\nFile size                    : 266 MiB\nPlayTime                     : 23mn 13s\nBit rate                     : 1603 Kbps\nEncoded date                 : UTC 2006-03-19 20:14:45\nWriting application          : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library              : libebml-0.7.5 &amp; libmatroska-0.7.7\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                        : DivX 5\nCodec/Family                 : MPEG-4V\nCodec settings, BVOP         : Yes\nCodec settings, QPel         : No\nCodec settings, GMC          : 0\nCodec settings, Matrix       : Default\nPlayTime                     : 23mn 12s\nBit rate                     : 1273 Kbps\nWidth                        : 720 pixels\nHeight                       : 400 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate                   : 29.970 fps\nResolution                   : 8 bits\nChroma                       : 4:2:0\nInterlacement                : Progressive\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                        : MPEG-1/2 L3\nCodec/Family                 : MPEG-1\nCodec/Info                   : MPEG-1 or 2 layer 3\nBit rate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels\nSampling rate                : 44.1 KHz\n\nAudio #1\nCodec                        : MPEG-1/2 L3\nCodec/Family                 : MPEG-1\nCodec/Info                   : MPEG-1 or 2 layer 3\nBit rate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae333f8dc19e2685f1160ea2fad1bd0e44f20203","amp;dn":"Burst+Angel+%28Complete%29+Dual+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae333f8dc19e2685f1160ea2fad1bd0e44f20203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,51,63,141,193,158,38,133,241,22,14,162,250,209,189,14,68,242,2,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
