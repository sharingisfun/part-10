As a lyricist, Krug has always struck a nice balance between erudite and hallucinatory, and standout cuts like the wistful first single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyone Is Noah, Everyone Is the Ark,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the languid, appropriately titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dreamy Summer,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the epic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Barbarian,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the ardent title track, the latter of which expertly sums up the giddy yet brutal slap of infatuation (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I see you there at the bottom of the stairs/Obliterating everything IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever written downÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), capture the complex emotions of devotion, both real and imagined, in a way thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both willfully poetic and hardened by reality. A classically trained ivory tickler, Krug's compositional style is as esoteric as his prose, lending an unpredictable musicality to the proceedings that allows the listener to forget that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re essentially listening in on a very intimate solo performance. That sense of voyeurism permeates nearly every inch of the intoxicating Julia with Blue Jeans On, resulting in a listening experience that invokes names like David Ackles, Scott Walker, and Fred Neil, suggesting that Krug's newly swollen heart may have coincided with a shadowy, late-'60s and early-'70s songsmith's audio bender.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54913c1a27de7b7619ed036441b41f65c2c6b69b","amp;dn":"Moonface+-+Julia+With+Blue+Jeans+On+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54913c1a27de7b7619ed036441b41f65c2c6b69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,145,60,26,39,222,123,118,25,237,3,100,65,180,31,101,194,198,182,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
