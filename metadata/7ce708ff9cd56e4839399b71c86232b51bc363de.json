After being put to bed one evening, mysterious things start to happen. Played in first person, the game lets its players immerse themselves in a child's limitless imagination. This is a perspective we all have a distant familiarity with, but few can clearly remember what it felt like. In the borderland between dream and reality, surreal creatures and diverse environments will present you with both physical and mental obstacles that challenge your creativity.\n\nInside the folder you need to download the pass from the web that I put inside.\n\nI hope you will enjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce708ff9cd56e4839399b71c86232b51bc363de","amp;dn":"Among+the+Sleep+MAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce708ff9cd56e4839399b71c86232b51bc363de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,231,8,255,156,213,110,72,57,57,155,113,200,98,50,181,27,195,99,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
