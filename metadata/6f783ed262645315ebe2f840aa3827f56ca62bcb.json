The band signed with Capitol Records in 1969 with a lineup of Evoy, Danny Marks and Paul Weldon. Marks left the band the following year and was succeeded by Roger Ellis. The band had several chart successes in the early 1970s before disbanding in 1974. Their name is derived from A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh, whose &quot;proper&quot; name is Edward Bear. Their top selling singles include &quot;You, Me and Mexico&quot;, &quot;Last Song&quot;, and &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;, all three of which were Top 5 hits in Canada and charted well in the United States.\n\nThe band had its biggest hit in 1972, when &quot;Last Song&quot; charted at #1 in Canada and peaked at #3 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It was awarded a gold disc in March 1973 for selling over one million copies by the Recording Industry Association of America. By then, the band's original line up had split up. Evoy remained as the primary songwriter and creative force throughout the band's career, rebuilding the band twice, until it finally was disbanded in 1974.\n\nThey won a Juno Award in 1973 in an outstanding group performance category.\n\nEvoy, who briefly embraced Scientology in 1973, went on to a solo career, but is currently retired from live performance and running a small recording studio. Marks has continued a successful career as a blues guitarist. Weldon performs with a jazz combo and teaches at Seneca College in Toronto. Bill Loop, bassist in the early 1970s, resides in Southwestern Ontario and plays locally with various session musicians. He also teaches guitar.\n\nThe band is a favourite of Quentin Tarantino, who feels the band should be regarded as &quot;The Beatles of Canada&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f783ed262645315ebe2f840aa3827f56ca62bcb","amp;dn":"Edward+Bear+-+The+Edward+Bear+Collection+%5B1991%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f783ed262645315ebe2f840aa3827f56ca62bcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,120,62,210,98,100,83,21,235,226,248,64,170,56,39,245,108,166,43,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
