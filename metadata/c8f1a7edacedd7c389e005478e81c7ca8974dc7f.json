In 1994, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by Time Magazine. One of the three original founding members,Toshio Matsuura (Ã¦ï¿½Â¾Ã¦ÂµÂ¦ Ã¤Â¿Å Ã¥Â¤Â« Matsuura Toshio?) left the group in 2002 to work with Universal Japan on a remix album project.\n\n\nReview:\nFeatured on 1994's Red Hot and Cool compilation, the Japanese production trio UFO heads a loose collective of musicians and vocalists present here. Jazz, R&amp;B, trip-hop, Spanish, Caribbean, and Brazilian rhythms all appear in one form or another; surprisingly, these disparate elements flow well through the course of ten songs.\nReview by John Bush\nRate 4/5 stars\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1\tUnited Future Airlines 4:48\n2\tMagic Wand Of Love 6:22\n3\tStolen Moments 5:21\n4\tFuture Light 5:58\n5\tMake It Better 5:33\n6\tSunday Folk Tale 6:17\n7\tMistress Of Dance 4:25\n8\tBar-F-Out! 5:00\n9\tDoopsylalolic 4:38\n10\tTears Of Gratitude 5:35\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: Japan\nGenre: nu-jazz\nFormat:tracks\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~754-881 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8f1a7edacedd7c389e005478e81c7ca8974dc7f","amp;dn":"%281994%29+United+Future+Organisation+-+No+Sound+Is+Too+Taboo+%5BFLAC%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8f1a7edacedd7c389e005478e81c7ca8974dc7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,241,167,237,172,237,215,195,137,224,5,71,142,129,199,202,137,116,220,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
