It was\nreleased in 1977 after an extended break for solo activity, and is especially notable for\nmarking the return of keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who had departed in 1974 in the aftermath\nof the Tales from Topographic Oceans tour. His re-entry was facilitated by the departure of\nPatrick Moraz, after having only played on Relayer, although Moraz is thanked in the credits.\n\nAllmusic's Ross Boissoneau has described this album as &quot;perhaps the most overlooked item\nin the Yes catalog&quot; Jon Anderson has said of the song &quot;Awaken&quot;. &quot;We had a hit record! I\nloved listening to 'Awaken', at last we had created a Masterwork&quot; and has indicated in some\ninterviews that he considers it to be Yes's most complete composition.\n\nThis album is a return to shorter, catchier songs after the experimental Close to the Edge,\nTales from Topographic Oceans and Relayer.\n\n\n1 - Going For The One [05:36]\n2 - Turn Of The Century [07:43]\n3 - Parallels [06:11]\n4 - Wonderous Stories [03:52]\n5 - Awaken [15:35]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 38:59\nTotal Size...........: 252.48 MB\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJon Anderson: vocals, percussion, harp\n\nChris Squire: bass guitar, vocals\n\nSteve Howe: electric and acoustic guitars, Spanish LaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºd\n(incorrectly listed as a &quot;vachalia&quot; at the time, and since as a &quot;Portuguese guitarra&quot;), lap steel guitar, vocals\n\nRick Wakeman: piano, organ, Polymoog and Minimoog synthesizers, church organ\n\nAlan White: drums, percussion\n\n1994 - Atlantic - CD [Remastered]\n\nIncluded.............: MD5, M3U, LOG, CUE\n\nCovers...............: Front Back","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d25e6b0900661bc08fa5ee271d2e83704f11e002","amp;dn":"Yes...+Going+For+The+One%2C1994+%28remastered%29+..+%28EAC%7EFLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d25e6b0900661bc08fa5ee271d2e83704f11e002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,94,107,9,0,102,27,192,143,165,238,39,29,46,131,112,79,17,224,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
