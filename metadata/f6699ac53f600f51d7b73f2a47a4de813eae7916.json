This isn\\&amp;#039;t a scene release, but unless your ears start bleeding when the .nfo is missing I suggest you get it.\n\nTrack list:\nDash &amp; Blast\nWe Flood Empty Lakes\nIlluminate My Heart, My Darling!\nA Song For Starlit Beaches\n\nI noticed that the last two tracks are named 03 ... and I\\&amp;#039;m to lazy to fix it. Also, for some reason the first three tracks are 192kbps while A Song For Starlit Beaches is 201kbps vbr. I might stop seeding from times to times, but I\\&amp;#039;ll try to keep it somewhat alive for as long as possible.\n\nCheers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6699ac53f600f51d7b73f2a47a4de813eae7916","amp;dn":"Yndi+Halda+-+Enjoy+Eternal+Bliss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6699ac53f600f51d7b73f2a47a4de813eae7916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,105,154,197,63,96,15,81,215,183,63,42,71,164,222,129,62,174,121,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
