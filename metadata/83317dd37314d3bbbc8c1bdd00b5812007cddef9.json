His age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity.[1] Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped M16 rifle. Duke&amp;#039;s alias (&quot;Golgo 13&quot;) is short for Golgotha, the place of Jesus Christ&amp;#039;s crucifixion.[1][2]\n\nThe character was portrayed by Ken Takakura in the 1973 live-action film version of Golgo 13 and by Sonny Chiba in its 1977 sequel, Assignment Kowloon. The character was voiced by Tetsuro Sagawa in The Professional and Akio Ohtsuka in Queen Bee. Duke is voiced by Hiroshi Tachi in the 2008 television series.\n\nIt is also believed by some that Golgo 13 is actually Goro Serizawa, the sole survivor of the &quot;Serizawa Family Murders&quot;. However a definitive answer is still unknown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83317dd37314d3bbbc8c1bdd00b5812007cddef9","amp;dn":"Golgo+13+-+The+Professional+Xvid+Avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83317dd37314d3bbbc8c1bdd00b5812007cddef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,49,125,211,115,20,211,187,188,140,27,221,0,181,129,32,7,205,222,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
