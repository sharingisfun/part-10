His thought has exerted a profound influence on 20th century philosophy, theology, psychology, and literature.\n\n&quot;The day will come when not only my writings, but precisely my life -- the intriguing secret of all the machinery -- will be studied and studied,&quot; he predicted.  Although Kierkegaard's life has been notoriously hard to study, so complex was the web of fact and fiction in his work, the following books are noteworthy attempts to reveal the delicate imbrication of his life and thought.\n\n\n* Joakim Garff - SÃƒËœREN KIERKEGAARD: A BIOGRAPHY (Princeton University Press, 2004).
