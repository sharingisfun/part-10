A lovely, avantgarde CD which brings to mind the old King Crimson's albums.\n\nGavin Harrison - a Porcupine Tree drummer and one of the best drum players. 05Ric - a real jazz guitar virtuoso.\n\nI'm uploading since there is no other torrent for this. Download this and if you like - buy the album!\n\nAND SEED PLEASE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2018ca974bab782249deed3c7d8413bd65353e7f","amp;dn":"Gavin+Harrison+%26amp%3B+05ric+-+The+Man+Who+Sold+Himself","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2018ca974bab782249deed3c7d8413bd65353e7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,24,202,151,75,171,120,34,73,222,237,60,125,132,19,189,101,53,62,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
