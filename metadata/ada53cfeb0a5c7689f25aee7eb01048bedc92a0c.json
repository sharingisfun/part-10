As a boy, he related to the cultural figures who represented goodnessÃ¢â‚¬â€but as an adult, he found himself unconsciously aligning with their enemies. This was not because he necessarily liked what they were doing; it was because they were doing it on purpose (and they were doing it better). They wanted to be evil. And what, exactly, was that supposed to mean? When we classify someone as a bad person, what are we really saying (and why are we so obsessed with saying it)? How does the culture of deliberate malevolence operate? \n\nIn I Wear the Black Hat, Klosterman questions the modern understanding of villainy. What was so Machiavellian about Machiavelli? Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we see Bernhard Goetz the same way we see Batman? Who is more worthy of our vitriolÃ¢â‚¬â€Bill Clinton or Don Henley? What was O. J. SimpsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second-worst decision? And why is Klosterman still haunted by some kid he knew for one week in 1985? \n\nMasterfully blending cultural analysis with self-interrogation and imaginative hypotheticals, I Wear the Black Hat delivers perceptive observations on the complexity of the antihero (seemingly the only kind of hero America still creates). I Wear the Black Hat is a rare example of serious criticism thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instantly accessible and really, really funny. Klosterman continues to be the only writer doing whatever it is heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing.\n\nAn Amazon Best Book of the Month, July 2013\n\n&quot;Intellectually vigorous and entertaining.&quot; --Publishers Weekly\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Educational, Humor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ada53cfeb0a5c7689f25aee7eb01048bedc92a0c","amp;dn":"I+Wear+the+Black+Hat_+Grappling+With+Villains+%28Real+and+Imagined","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ada53cfeb0a5c7689f25aee7eb01048bedc92a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,165,60,254,176,165,199,104,159,37,174,231,235,1,4,139,237,201,42,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
