How cool is that!!!\n\n\n\nReview:\nAn experimental set during the second Japanese tour, this show is very loud, fast, and exciting. &quot;We've just come back from Hong Kong. We went to Hong Kong for a few days and we're well knackered!&quot; told Plant. His voice is still in good shape and the band is an amazing instrumental machine that grooves. The band still looking for the title for The Song Remains The Same and tonight Plant introduced: &quot;We can't find a name for it. We'll call it ... The Campaign.&quot; Dazed And Confused has some song references in the middle and is very long and excellent. Moby Dick was performed only once during that show and the percussionist was announced as John &quot;Samurai&quot; Bonham! The Whole Lotta Love medley has almost no blues, only fast rockabilly songs, and the group really flies! The encores are great, especially Stand By Me, which sounds wonderful with Robert's voice.
