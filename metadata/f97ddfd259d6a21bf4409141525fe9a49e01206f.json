The story focused on a love triangle between two men and a woman. It is the only film in his career for which Hitchcock took or was given a full writing credit. The film, while widely considered a minor work, features photography tricks Hitchcock would use again years later in films like The Man Who Knew Too Much, most notably during the climactic boxing sequences.\n\nVideo: XVID 720x576 15.00fps 1025Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 22050Hz mono 31Kbps\nRunning time: 1:29:57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97ddfd259d6a21bf4409141525fe9a49e01206f","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+-+The+Ring+%281927%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f97ddfd259d6a21bf4409141525fe9a49e01206f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,125,223,210,89,214,162,27,244,64,145,65,82,95,233,164,158,1,32,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
