The planet is suffering the consequences of disastrous greenhouse flooding. Most nations have been taken over by ultraconservative religion-based governments, such as the New Morality in the United States. With population ballooning and resources running out, Earth is heading for nuclear war. Stoner, the star voyager, wants to save Earth's people. But first he must save himself from the frightened and ambitious zealots who want to destroy this stranger - and the terrifying message he brings from the stars. \n\n\nNarrated by: Stefan Rudnicki\nLength: 11 hrs and 34 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:08-10-09\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed84e086549f8089663d246aa7ff2aa8236106af","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+The+Return+%28The+Grand+Tour+%2323%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed84e086549f8089663d246aa7ff2aa8236106af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,132,224,134,84,159,128,137,102,61,36,106,167,255,42,168,35,97,6,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
