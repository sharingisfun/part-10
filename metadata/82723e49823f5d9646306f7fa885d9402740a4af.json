The wagons have special bogies which means that the middle wagon (Saadkms M) cannot be coupled with other wagons except an end wagon (Saadkms E1 or Saadkms E2). \n\nThe Saadkms E1 and Saadkms E2 are very similar, except that they display a different direction of the road truck mounted on it. (In the Scenario Editor you see an arrow which indicates which direction the trucks are facing.)\n\nAlso included is the Bcmz passenger carriage which can be included in the rake along with the Saadkms to transport the truck drivers to their destination along with their vehicles.\n\n\nENJOY PEOPLE \n\nNOTEEEEEEEEE----------&gt; ONLY GONE SEED UNTIL 7PM U.K TIME!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82723e49823f5d9646306f7fa885d9402740a4af","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+Just+Trains+Saadkms+Freight+Wagons+%26amp%3B+Bcmz+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82723e49823f5d9646306f7fa885d9402740a4af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,114,62,73,130,63,93,150,70,48,111,127,168,133,217,64,39,64,164,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
