Because modern gastrointestinal pathology practice centers on specimens obtained during endoscopic examination, the atlas focuses on biopsy pathology, providing Ã¢â‚¬Å“real-worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ microscopic images and ancillary diagnostic studies for most commonly-encountered abnormalities and diseases affecting these two organs. The book is supplemented with endoscopic and special study images.\n\nAuthored by nationally and internationally recognized pathologists, Atlas of Esophagus and Stomach Pathology is a valuable tool for both pathologists-in-training seeking to make Ã¢â‚¬Å“new acquaintancesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and practicing surgical pathologists in need of a quick visual reference in recalling Ã¢â‚¬Å“old friendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the world of diagnostic gastrointestinal pathology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c92b4f2ff9b7e2de42ffbc079143c37aa9f1b69","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Esophagus+and+Stomach+Pathology+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c92b4f2ff9b7e2de42ffbc079143c37aa9f1b69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,146,180,242,255,155,126,45,228,47,251,192,121,20,60,55,170,159,27,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
