Dan loves taking complex concepts and distilling them into easy-to-understand fundamentals that are illustrated with numerous applications and sample problems. His course prepares students for test day with AP level examples with each lesson, a full AP test walk-through, and even more examples from state physics tests. Topics cover the entire AP Physics B syllabus, including Mechanics, Energy, Fluids, Thermodynamics, Waves, Optics, and Modern and Nuclear Physics. Professor Fullerton obtained his B.S. and M.S. in Microelectronic Engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). He has taught undergraduate and graduate Microelectronic Engineering courses at RIT since 2003, and High School Physics since 2007. He is also the author of Honors Physics Essentials, APlusPhysics: Your Guide to Regents Physics Essentials, and Physics: Fundamentals and Problem Solving.\n\nTotal length - 24:35","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4acc5c5a37ba99b1d7537038b0550c6a7ee83118","amp;dn":"Educator.com+-+AP+Physics+B+with+Dan+Fullerton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4acc5c5a37ba99b1d7537038b0550c6a7ee83118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,204,92,90,55,186,153,177,215,83,112,56,176,85,12,106,126,232,49,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
