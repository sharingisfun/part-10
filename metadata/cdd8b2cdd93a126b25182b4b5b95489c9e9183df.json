The sleeve is nice colours etc, I think there \ncould have been a bit more information and history about the band.\n\nYou are NUTS of you do not buy this album right now, a great introduction \nto Whitesnake.\n\nBUY,BUY,BUY!!!!!!! \n\nNote: Sorry about the last track as i had to scource from elsewhwere as\n      the last track was damaged.
