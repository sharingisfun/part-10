With the heat of summer in full swing, the next stage of Secondhand Serenade's saga is gearing up for release. Those familiar with the words of John Vesely, the man behind Secondhand Serenade, have lived through his picturesque stories of life's ups and downs - from the act's acoustic debut, Awake, to the fuller, and more emotionally complex sounds of 2008's sophomore A Twist In My Story. Fans have gravitated to John's heart-on-his sleeve approach. &quot;Hear Me Now&quot; is calling to be heard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343f36b130592a42ac12493e2616942943b32fd4","amp;dn":"Secondhand+Serenade+-+Hear+Me+Now+%5Bmp3-128-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343f36b130592a42ac12493e2616942943b32fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,63,54,177,48,89,42,66,172,18,73,62,38,22,148,41,67,179,47,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
