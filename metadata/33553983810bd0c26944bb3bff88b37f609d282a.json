Unlike most psychology books it gives detailed scientific explanations of how trauma from childhood affects the mind (as well as the body)and how to reverse its effects. Very scientific, but easy to read and understand. Despite its age the information contained in the book is still relevant. If only the scientific community would accept the concepts contained in this book it would revolutionize the study of both psychology and medicine. A definite MUST READ!\n\n\nTitle\tThe Anatomy of Mental Illness: The Scientific Basis of Primal Therapy\nAuthor Arthur Janov\nPublisher\tG.P.
