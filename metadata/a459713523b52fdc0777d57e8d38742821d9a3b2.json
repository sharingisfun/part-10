From the PBS series produced by filmmaker Martin Scorsese, this release features 10 tracks including 2 previously unreleased tracks, 'Georgia Blues' &amp; 'Blue Window'. MCA. 2003.\n\nThis cd is a real treasure for anyone interested in electric blues. Jimi had his roots in the blues, and towards the end of his career he was more and more tilting towards these roots and played with a lot of other blues artists of that time. Here you will find a pretty decent collection of Hendrix palying some original (Red House, Vodoo Chile etc) and some classic covers like (Georgia Blues etc). One of my favourite all time tracks is the amazing version of Voodoo Chile... this almost 15 min long track is a masterpiece and the chemistry between Hendrix, Mitchels(drums) and Steve Winwood(organ) is really mindblowing. The drum solo by Mitchels is something special. \n\n\n\nEAC Read mode               : Secure\nUtilize accurate stream : Yes\nDefeat audio cache      : Yes\nMake use of C2 pointers : No\n\n\nFull Artwork\n\n\n        1.\tRed House\n\t2.\tVoodoo Chile\n\t3.\tCome on (Let the Good Times Roll)\n\t4.\tGeorgia Blues - (previously unreleased)\n\t5.\tCountry Blues\n\t6.\tHear My Train a Comin'\n\t7.\tIt's Too Bad\n\t8.\tMy Friend\n\t9.\tBlue Window - (previously unreleased)\n\t10.\tMidnight Lightning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a459713523b52fdc0777d57e8d38742821d9a3b2","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix-Martin+Scorsese+Presents+the+Blues%282003%29%5BEAC-APE%5D%5BT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a459713523b52fdc0777d57e8d38742821d9a3b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,89,113,53,35,181,47,220,7,119,213,126,141,56,116,40,33,217,163,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
