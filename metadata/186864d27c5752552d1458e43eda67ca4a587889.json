Ken Loach directs Paul Laverty&amp;#039;s sparkling script about the grim world of migrant employment and the opportunities it affords two women who, when the world kicks them in the teeth, decide to pass on the pain.\n\nBecoming entangled in the murk of employing illegal immigrants, they soon find themselves turning into monsters by degrees. So much more a compelling story of characters and consequences than an issue-based drama, It&amp;#039;s a Free World... boasts shining central performances from Kierston Wareing as Angie and Juliet Ellis as Rose.\n\nCodec: XviD\nPlayTime: 1h 31mn\nBit rate: 925 Kbps\nWidth: 640 pixels\nHeight: 352 pixels\nAspect ratio: 16/9\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.164\n\nDVB Rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:186864d27c5752552d1458e43eda67ca4a587889","amp;dn":"Ken+Loach+-+It%5C%27s+a+Free+World+%282007%29+%5BDVBRip%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"186864d27c5752552d1458e43eda67ca4a587889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,104,100,210,124,87,82,85,45,20,88,228,62,218,103,202,74,88,120,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
