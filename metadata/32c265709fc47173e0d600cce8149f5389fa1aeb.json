He spends most of his time throwing parties and &quot;fund raisers&quot;. When his father decides that it's time for tough love, he doesn't pay his tuition. So Van becomes a professional party thrower. At the same time, Gwen who writes for the college paper, is tasked with doing a story on him, but Van is too busy partying to do that. So she writes it using info from people who talk about him and writes an unflattering piece, which doesn't make him happy. He then dares her to see if she can get the true story but is more interested in trying to score with her, which is not easy because she has a boyfriend, who is a snob, and who is not too happy with the amount time she is spending with him. So he tries to get rid of him\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283111/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283111/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRyan Reynolds\nTara Reid\nTim Matheson\nKal Penn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c265709fc47173e0d600cce8149f5389fa1aeb","amp;dn":"Van+Wilder+2002+UNRATED+DvDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c265709fc47173e0d600cce8149f5389fa1aeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,194,101,112,159,196,113,115,224,214,0,204,232,20,159,83,137,250,26,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
