Here in real-life Japan, 2009, the defining act is Perfume: three carefully choreographed girls who sing autotune-crippled vocal lines over a blend of video-game synths and hard techno created by producer-of-the-moment Yasutaka Nakata.\n\nAnd somewhere in between lies She. Debuting amid a flurry of both Perfume copycats and virtual pop singers, She does not exist Ã¢â‚¬â€ the CD inlay explains that she is a replicant, making for the sort of album detective Deckard would listen to in his flying car in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Her sound is a dirtier version of the prevailing chart-friendly techno-pop; her voice provided by five different singers; her face designed in Photoshop.\n\nOn closer inspection, it turns out that She is a he. The music, production and artwork are the labor of Lain Trzaska, a Polish producer and artist based in Sweden whose catalog of free-to-download albums takes in chiptune, electro, house, ambient and acoustica, and caught the ear of someone at Japan's Pony Canyon last year.\n\nAll of these genres are represented on &quot;Orion,&quot; but, there is also a noticeable Japanese flavor: &quot;Just Your Eyes&quot; samples &quot;Tip Taps Tip&quot; by pop-hop duo HalCali; the album is peppered with Japanese vocals; and the more mellow moments recall those on Cornelius' 2001 album &quot;Point&quot;. Above all, it is a coherent, thoughtful album of distorted house and minor-chord electro-pop, hand-crafted by Trzaska with a love and care that is absent from so much recent J-pop.\n\nShe may be fake, but she is a perfect reminder that the best pop music is born of imagination.&quot;\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c04c108291fd961d03115a4dfcc46e6e1922031","amp;dn":"she+-+Orion+%28album%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c04c108291fd961d03115a4dfcc46e6e1922031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,4,193,8,41,31,217,97,208,49,21,164,223,204,70,230,225,146,32,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
