While the disc may appear to be just another throw-together of Holiday hits, with nothing in particular to distinguish it from the others, the arrangements, the performances and the recordings themselves are all wonderful. Backed by tight, laid-back session musicians (Oscar Peterson plays piano on many of the tracks--check out his solo on &quot;Lover, Come Back to Me&quot;), Holiday here enjoys the last full flush of her talents before health and substance abuse problems claimed her voice in the late '50s.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - If The Moon Turns Green\n 02 - Remember\n 03 - Autumn In New York\n 04 - My Man\n 05 - Lover, Come Back To Me\n 06 - Stormy Weather\n 07 - Yesterdays\n 08 - He's Funny That Way\n 09 - I Can't Face The Music\n 10 - How Deep Is The Ocean?\n 11 - What A Little Moonlight Can Do\n 12 - I Cried For You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0785ea8aaa9dd988e0cf057cc7090f823fdfae6","amp;dn":"Billie+Holiday+-+Recital+%281956%2F2015%29+%5BMONO%5D+24+bit-+96+khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0785ea8aaa9dd988e0cf057cc7090f823fdfae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,120,94,168,170,169,221,152,142,12,240,87,204,112,144,248,35,253,250,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
