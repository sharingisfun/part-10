Altoist Hank Crawford, one of the most soulful stylists to emerge during the 1960s, is heard on 31 of his best recordings, 27 as a leader plus sideman appearances with Ray Charles, David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman, B.B. King and Etta James. Crawford's sound and style were virtually the same in the 1990s as they were in the '60s although the settings changed a bit. Highlights of this well-conceived introduction include &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love,&quot; &quot;Two Years of Torture,&quot; &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore,&quot; &quot;The Very Thought of You,&quot; &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; and &quot;Hank's Groove.&quot; Recommended to listeners not familiar with the beauty of Hank Crawford's playing.
