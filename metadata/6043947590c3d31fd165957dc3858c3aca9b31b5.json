It's a journey inside the mind of one of British radio, television and film's most popular, peculiar and comic performers. One of its most tragic too.\n\nSpanning his entire life, this is the story of Williams's career and private life. It is also a behind-the-scenes look at Williams, not only recreating some of his greatest performances, but also giving a candid and poignant insight into his professional hopes, personal upsets and sexual frustrations of a man who was uncomfortable in his own skin.\n\nThe screenplay is rude, arch, uncompromising and hilarious. Michael Sheen delivers a tour-de-force performance as 'the man of a thousand voices'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6043947590c3d31fd165957dc3858c3aca9b31b5","amp;dn":"Kenneth+Williams+-+Fantabulosa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6043947590c3d31fd165957dc3858c3aca9b31b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,67,148,117,144,195,211,31,209,101,149,125,195,133,140,58,202,155,49,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
