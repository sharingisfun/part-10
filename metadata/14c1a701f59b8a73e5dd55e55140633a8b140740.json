Why did certain theologies become more liberal and increasing numbers of \npeople choose less dogmatic expressions of faith?or even no faith at all? \n\nWhat are the roots of our love for nature, of the near-spiritual experience so many \nof us now find in the ripple of a stream in the morning sun or the thunderous roar \nof ocean waves? \n\nFinally, and perhaps most important of all, what is the source of our distinctly \nAmerican way of experiencing ourselves?confident in our value as individuals, \ncertain of our ability to discover personal truths in the natural world, self-reliant \nin the face of uncertainty and change? \n\nAnswers to questions like these are found in and around Boston and the town of \nConcord, Massachusetts, which became, little more than five decades after the \nAmerican Revolution, the epicenter of a profoundly influential movement that would \nreshape many beliefs and make possible the America we know today. \n\nThat movement is Transcendentalism. Drawing on an array of influences from Europe \nand the non-Western world, it also offered uniquely American perspectives of \nthought: an emphasis on the divine in nature, on the value of the individual and \nintuition, and on belief in a spirituality that might &quot;transcend&quot; one&amp;#039;s own sensory \nexperience to provide a more useful guide for daily living than is possible from \nempirical and logical reasoning. \n\nA Movement that Transformed America \n\nThe extraordinary members of this informal movement provided intellectual and moral \nleadership for many social transformations: the abolition of slavery, equal rights \nfor women, freedom of religious thought and practice, educational reform, and more. \nThe influence of their ideas continues today in many aspects of our culture, from \nefforts to preserve large tracts of wild nature to civil disobedience around the world. \n\nBut although the ideas that contributed to New England Transcendentalism had many \nroots, the strength of its impact came from the intellectual energy of two remarkable \nindividuals: Ralph Waldo Emerson, the most important figure behind Transcendentalism \nin America, and Henry David Thoreau, his most influential disciple. \n\nThe Power of the Individual \n\n&quot;Without Emerson and Thoreau,&quot; notes Professor Ashton Nichols, &quot;the United States \nwould not have developed into the nation it has become. We would not believe in the \npower of the individual to the extent that we do, nor would we see nature at the \ncenter of one view of the American psyche. ... If Emerson gave us a new view of \nAmerica and American thinking, Thoreau gave us a new way of living and a new vision \nof each individual.&quot; \n\nIn Emerson, Thoreau, and the Transcendentalist Movement, Professor Nichols introduces \nus to these two remarkable thinkers and a diverse group of intellectual activists, \nliterary figures, and social reformers whose ideas, often considered radical in the \ndecades before and after the Civil War, would remake American society. \n\nAmong those you&amp;#039;ll meet: \nLiberal theologian Theodore Parker. He made the pulpit a forum for social activism \nand, as a staunch opponent of slavery, would sometimes preach with a pistol in the \npulpit, knowing that the fugitive slaves who often attended his massive rallies of \n2,000 or more were likely to attract slave-catchers. \nEducator Amos Bronson Alcott. A self-taught teacher and educational reformer, he did \naway with corporal punishment and even extended his own hand for students to hit to \ndemonstrate his position that classroom confusion was likely to be the teacher&amp;#039;s fault. \nWriter Margaret Fuller. The brilliant writer, editor, and voice for women&amp;#039;s rights \nwas also the most influential of the female Transcendentalists and one of the first \nfemale foreign correspondents. She was onboard a ship that sank within sight of Fire \nIsland, New York, and a saddened Emerson dispatched Thoreau in hopes of at least \nrecovering Fuller&amp;#039;s manuscripts from the wreckage. Thoreau reported finding only \nunidentifiable human remains on the desolate beach. \n\nExplore the Lives of Emerson and Thoreau \n\nMany courses relate the principles of Transcendentalism and discuss the crucial \ncontributions of these two extraordinary men, Emerson and Thoreau. But what motivated \nthem? Who and what were their chief influences? \n\nYou&amp;#039;ll learn, for example, of the profound impact on Emerson of the death of his \nfirst wife. You&amp;#039;ll learn that he was influenced by a deep understanding of classical \ntexts. He read Buddhist and Hindu sacred writings at a time when most Americans were \nnot aware of their existence, and he translated Dante. You&amp;#039;ll also see how this \nthoroughly well-read person never lost contact with those who were less well educated. \nProfessor Nichols tells a story of a washerwoman who was fond of attending Emerson&amp;#039;s \nlectures, even though, she said, she could not understand his ideas. Why did she \nattend? Because she liked &quot;to go and see him stand up there and look as though he \nthought everyone else is as good as he is.&quot; \n\nAnd you will see a Thoreau who, though often thought of as the &quot;hermit&quot; of Walden \nPond, was also a profoundly dedicated abolitionist?like so many other \nTranscendentalists. When John Brown led the raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers \nFerry, was captured, and subsequently executed, it was Thoreau who delivered a \nstirring eulogy, citing Brown as a &quot;Transcendentalist above all&quot; who &quot;did not recognize \nunjust human laws but resisted them as he was bid. No man in America has ever stood up \nso persistently and effectively for the dignity of human nature,&quot; he said, concluding \nthat Brown was &quot;the most American of us all.&quot; \n\nThe Impact of Transcendentalism \n\nYet as important as the dynamic figures you&amp;#039;ll meet is Professor Nichols&amp;#039;s own \nmultifaceted approach?essential in a course examining Transcendentalism. Rather than \nfocusing on a handful of well-known figures, or on a single issue such as slavery, \nreligion, philosophy, or literature, he has created a course meant to instill a new \nappreciation of the individuals who made up the movement and of the movement&amp;#039;s impact \non America. You come away not with an arid list of abstract ideas, but with a real \nunderstanding of aspects of American life before the Transcendentalists&amp;#039; ideas took hold, \nof the contemporary reactions provoked by those ideas, and of the long-lasting changes \nthey inspired, many of which are still with us today. \n\nProfessor Nichols&amp;#039;s rich background?he worked as a journalist before going on to study, \nteach, and write about poetry, fiction, history, and nature writing?makes him an ideal \nteacher for a course that extends across so many subjects and so many remarkable individuals. \n\nHis wide-ranging approach links directly to the themes of the course; the path of lifelong \nself-education is yet another legacy left to us by Emerson, Thoreau, and the Transcendentalists.\n\n2598_01.mp3\t21.97 MB\n2598_02.mp3\t21.11 MB\n2598_03.mp3\t20.97 MB\n2598_04.mp3\t21.05 MB\n2598_05.mp3\t20.56 MB\n2598_06.mp3\t20.14 MB\n2598_07.mp3\t21.05 MB\n2598_08.mp3\t20.75 MB\n2598_09.mp3\t21.32 MB\n2598_10.mp3\t21.91 MB\n2598_11.mp3\t20.37 MB\n2598_12.mp3\t20.55 MB\n2598_13.mp3\t20.87 MB\n2598_14.mp3\t20.79 MB\n2598_15.mp3\t20.88 MB\n2598_16.mp3\t21.33 MB\n2598_17.mp3\t21.00 MB\n2598_18.mp3\t20.51 MB\n2598_19.mp3\t20.68 MB\n2598_20.mp3\t20.56 MB\n2598_21.mp3\t21.64 MB\n2598_22.mp3\t21.31 MB\n2598_23.mp3\t20.10 MB\n2598_24.mp3\t21.57 MB\nEmerson Thoreau &amp; Transcendentalist Movement.pdf\t1.26 MB\n\n\nMore related uploads: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c1a701f59b8a73e5dd55e55140633a8b140740","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Emerson%2C+Thoreau+%26+the+Transcendentalist+Movement","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c1a701f59b8a73e5dd55e55140633a8b140740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,193,167,1,245,155,138,115,229,221,85,229,81,64,99,58,139,20,7,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
