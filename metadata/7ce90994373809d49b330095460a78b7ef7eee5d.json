If you hate Man. U. from the bottom of your heart &quot;United&quot; might be hard to swallow. But if you love them (or at least hold no grudge) you&amp;#039;re gonna enjoy this flick. The acting is charmingly semi-good, and the story is enjoyable in all it&amp;#039;s simplicity.\n\nAnd for those of you who couldn&amp;#039;t care less about soccer, it doesn&amp;#039;t matter. It&amp;#039;s like not watching The Lord of the Rings because you&amp;#039;re not a ringmaker.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce90994373809d49b330095460a78b7ef7eee5d","amp;dn":"United.2003.Norwegian.DVD-Rip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce90994373809d49b330095460a78b7ef7eee5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,233,9,148,55,56,9,212,155,51,0,149,70,10,120,183,239,126,238,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
