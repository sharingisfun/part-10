She has worked hard fulfilling her\nrole as a child prodigy and graduating college years\nbefore her peers. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the good girl, the brilliant girl.\n\nUnfortunately, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the dateless young woman.\n\nThat all changes with one phone call. JessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rigid, predictable\nlife upends when she must visit a small, obscure town to deal\nwith a relativeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just any little speck of a town,\nthough. Long lost memories come crashing down on JessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nworld when two men, the Blackard brothers, seem to lure her in.\n\nDylan is cover model handsome, and pursues Jess the minute she\ncomes to town. Then there is tall, dark and gorgeous Carson, who\nhides his own secrets behind his hardened reserve.\n\nFor someone who has been governed by her own obsessive\nbehaviors and fears, Jess lets her guard down and jumps at the\nopportunity to have an affair with a man she actually finds\nattractive for a change.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one problem. Jess discovers that she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a\nsimple romantic fling because true passion does indeed come with\nsome very big strings attached to it. She will have to own up to her\nown truths about love and face the two extraordinary men; both\ntroubled in their own ways and both determined to have her.\n\n\n\nFearsome\nby S.A.
