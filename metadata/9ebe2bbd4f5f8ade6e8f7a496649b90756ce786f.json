But re-kindling her friendship and the dizzying new emotions along for the ride are the least of her concerns. Because Deanna has a secret Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and somebody knows. Someone who is out to get Hyde. \n\nAnd if she doesn't play along, and help the enemy destroy himÃ¢â‚¬Â¦she will be sold to the highest bidder in the black market for human swans. Now Deanna is struggling to break free from the gilded cage that would trap her foreverÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Feather Bound is a dark debut reminiscent of Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez's A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings, and the twisted truth behind the fairy tale of Cinderella.\n\nGenre: Young Adult / Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ebe2bbd4f5f8ade6e8f7a496649b90756ce786f","amp;dn":"Feather+Bound+by+Sarah+Raughley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ebe2bbd4f5f8ade6e8f7a496649b90756ce786f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,190,43,189,79,95,138,222,110,143,122,73,102,73,185,7,86,206,120,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
