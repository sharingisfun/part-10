Its long time in the making became an aspect of its subject; its vicissitudes were subtle mirrored in the &quot;story&quot; of the movie.  For in his debut, Rivette began to define a bond between fiction and a modern myth: the uneasiness that we are victims of a grand conspiracy.  At on elevel, the film is as sensitive an account of Paris as Franju&amp;#039;s documentaries; it is also a picture of a restless creative group -- the filming is reflected in the situation of the film, an abortive production of Shakespeare&amp;#039;s &quot;Pericles.&quot;  The immediate themes ride above a pervasive mood of disorganization to the point of breakdown.  For this Paris is the universal metropolis; it looks forward to &quot;Alphaville,&quot; just as it quotes from Lang -- in which our sense of meaning is undermined and justified by an infinite but imprecise conspiracy. - David Thomson\n\nMy rip.
