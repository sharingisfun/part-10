This situation is especially difficult for one family consisting solely of three women representing three successive generations. All the males in their family have died in various Afghani wars. The mother had been working as a nurse in a hospital, but regardless of she not being allowed to work, the Taliban has cut off funding to the hospital. The mother and grandmother make what they feel is the only decision they can to survive: they will have the preteen daughter masquerade as a boy so that she can get a job to support the family. The daughter, feeling powerless, agrees despite being scared as if the Taliban discover her masquerade, she is certain they will kill her. Partly as a symbolic measure, the daughter plants a lock of her now cut hair in a pot so that her lost femininity can flourish. The only people outside the family who know of the ruse are the milk vendor who employs the daughter - he who was a friend of her deceased father - and a local boy named Espandi who recognizes her despite her outward change in appearance. Espandi renames her Osama. The masquerade becomes more difficult when the Taliban recruit all the local boys to school, which includes military training.\n\nInfo:\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Osama 2003 DVDRip(EngSub) GoGo(ExtraTorrent)Osama 2003 DVDRip(EngSub) GoGo(ExtraTorrent).avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 600 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 009 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nBit rate                         : 894 Kbps\nWidth                            : 576 pixels\nHeight                           : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.895\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.213\nStream size                      : 532 MiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 102 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 60.8 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 180 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\nLanguage                         : Pushto\nSubtitles                        : English(Hardcoded)\nGenre                            : Drama | War &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368913/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1517583a18ae0a2729d20ec691024059dc5f0c","amp;dn":"Osama+2003+DVDRip%28EngSub%29+GoGo%28ExtraTorrent%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1517583a18ae0a2729d20ec691024059dc5f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,21,23,88,58,24,174,10,39,41,210,14,198,145,2,64,89,220,95,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
