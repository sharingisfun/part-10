Design: \tSHINJI KATAKURA\nIllustration: \tSHINJI KATAKURA\nScenario: \tRENYA SETOGUCHI\n\nShikanosuke Meajima is a student at the Missionary school, Oubi Academy. He doesn't attend his club, he doesn't put much effort in his studies, all he does is show up at his part time job; in short, his life could be better. One day, he meets a strange girl, Kirari Shiino, at work and before he knows it, they've formed a punk band.\n\nThe band consists of Shikanosuke, Kirari, his childhood friend Chie Isurugi, and a rich but weak young lady by the name of Sarina Kashiwara. The four of them are members of the Second Literature Club, which has hardly any active members and is already scheduled to be disbanded. This band is their chance to stand out and give one final farewell at the Culture Festival.\n\nThe challenge was foolhardy, but after eccentric training they managed to succeed and rock out the peaceful Oubi Academy with their debut performance. That should have been it.\nThey were satisfied.\nThey should have returned to their normal lives.\nHowever, their final performance at a local Live House became a hit on the Internet and requests for their performance start flying in from far and wide.\n\nOne problem: exams are coming up and their parents are opposed to the band!\n\nWho cares!\n\nThe four of them embark on their final adventure, a long tour of Japan, armed with their dreams and their instruments, all aboard a rickety van that could fall apart at any moment.\n\n&quot;First stop, Nagoya!&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor some reason, this game is not on TPB yet, so I'm here to fill the void.\n\n\nTo find more quality games of this genre, check out http://thepiratebay.se/user/Hgames/\n\nIf you liked this game, buy it to support MangaGamer, so that they translate more great games in the future! http://www.mangagamer.com/main/\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstructions:\n1.
