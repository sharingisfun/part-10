Towards the very beginning of the film, the owner of a news wire service, newspaper and TV news empire dies--leaving the future to his ne'er do-well son (Vincent Price). Instead of picking a man to head this organization, he deliberately pushes these men to try to undermine and outdo each other to garner his favor! At the same time, there is a plot involving a serial killer which soon takes up most of the film's focus.\n\nDVDRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f77a2ecb17d15cbc20e5794e5016dac60c6ad6","amp;dn":"While+the+City+Sleeps+%281956%29+100+min.Dana+Andrews%2CRhonda+Fleming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f77a2ecb17d15cbc20e5794e5016dac60c6ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,247,122,46,203,23,209,92,188,32,229,121,78,80,22,218,198,12,106,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
