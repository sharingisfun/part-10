Over the years and subsequent expansion of the subway, the signage has been corrupted by the use of other typefaces such as Helvetica and Gill Sans, however the original lettering remains unique. The lettering on the original signage consists only of uppercase characters and a few bits of punctuation in two weights ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the older subway stations used bolder lettering than some of the newer stations. For numbers, a version of the numerals from Futura appears to have been used.\n\nThe Toronto Subway fonts were developed from rubbings of the lettering etched into station walls and photographs of painted signage. The overall style of the lettering is very mechanical, almost naive, yet still having a certain amount of elegance, and this style was followed as much as possible in developing the companion lowercase, extended characters and extra punctuation.\n\nContains .pfm .pfb &amp; .ttf files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c133effd3098562efe2cd4f0a280d88324e9ac","amp;dn":"Toronto+Subway+Font+Family","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c133effd3098562efe2cd4f0a280d88324e9ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,193,51,239,253,48,152,86,46,254,44,212,240,162,128,216,131,36,233,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
