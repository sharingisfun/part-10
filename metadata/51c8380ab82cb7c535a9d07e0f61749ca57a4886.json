Includes the Computones CDs.\n\nI prefer to utilize these books as image files, so I left them that way. If you want to make them into a pdf file and reupload, GO FOR IT! :D\n\n-A Quick Note About the Computones Volumes- \nThere were a lot of repeated pages (mostly technical/troubleshooting stuff) throughout this series. \nAny pages that were included in a previous volume have been omitted (to save on scanning/editing time). \n\nAlso: I was able to get the Computones software to work with GIMP 2.6 using the PSPI plugin. Haven't tried with the latest versions though. \nI remember trying to get it to work in Photoshop CS5 and it didn't work--so your best bet is GIMP or an earlier, supported version of Photoshop.
