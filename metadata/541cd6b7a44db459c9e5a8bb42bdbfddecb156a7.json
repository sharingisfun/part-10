It addresses building envelope requirements for thermal performance and air leakage, as well as the installation of energy efficient mechanical, lighting, and power systems. The model code regulations found in this book help result in the optimal utilization of fossil fuel and nondepletable resources in all communities. Prescriptive- and performance-based approaches to energy efficient design are emphasized. The 2003 edition is fully compatible with all the International Codes published by the International Code Council (ICC)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:541cd6b7a44db459c9e5a8bb42bdbfddecb156a7","amp;dn":"International+Energy+Conservation+Code+%28ICC%2C+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"541cd6b7a44db459c9e5a8bb42bdbfddecb156a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,28,214,183,164,77,180,89,201,229,168,187,66,189,191,221,236,177,86,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
