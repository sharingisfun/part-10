So he goes back east to Chicago to recruit wives for his employees. From the candidates he selects 150, who seem able to survive a months long journey across &quot;The Great American Desert&quot; and the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThis is not available in DVD remaster yet.  This is a VHS rip.  It is however, good quality and when I go full screen for the playback, the detail remains quite good.  Only one source on the entire eDonkey network.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b29f4e0325b23fba327325a109024f507b88c59","amp;dn":"Westward+the+Women+%281951%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b29f4e0325b23fba327325a109024f507b88c59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,41,244,224,50,91,35,251,163,39,50,90,16,144,36,245,7,184,140,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
