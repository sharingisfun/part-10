Promotional info - &quot;It hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly been easy for Wolverine and Hercules lately. As if combating the most fearsome creatures of ancient mytholgy werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all working for the Hand. With a band of zombie thugs to contend with, the sea monster Kraken unleashed, and Mastsuo and King Eurytheus at the helm, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take more than godly heroics and mutant know-how to end this once and for all.&quot; Thanks to G85King-Empire for the digital copy, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6feb1d8de9b59c8a8987fd69366370a2ed7cd30","amp;dn":"Wolverine%2FHercules+-+Myths%2C+Monsters%2C+and+Mutants+01-04+%282011%7CD%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6feb1d8de9b59c8a8987fd69366370a2ed7cd30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,254,177,216,222,155,89,200,168,152,127,214,147,102,55,10,46,215,205,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
