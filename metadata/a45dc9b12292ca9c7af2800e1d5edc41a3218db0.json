An example of this neglect is the ignoring by historians of the role played by the Rothschild family in the history of the 19th century. The object of this work is to appraise the important influence of this family on the politics of the period, not only in Europe, but throughout the world. The influence of the Rothschilds, interestingly enough, is barely mentioned in other more comprehensive works. The aim of this work is to trace the rise of the House of Rothschild from its small beginnings to the great position it obtained, culminating in the year of its great crisis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a45dc9b12292ca9c7af2800e1d5edc41a3218db0","amp;dn":"The+Rise+of+the+House+of+Rothschild+%28biggest+war+profiteers+in+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a45dc9b12292ca9c7af2800e1d5edc41a3218db0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,93,201,177,34,146,202,156,122,242,128,14,29,94,220,65,163,33,141,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
