(Springer, Horizons, 2005).pdf\n\nISBN 3540244514\n\nThis introduction to computational fluid dynamics serves as a unique advanced-undergraduate text that brings together Cebeci's lifelong experience as a teacher at the University of California and a senior scientist for Boeing Company. Conservation equations for compressible and incompressible flows are the prime theme. The text concentrates on finite difference and finite volume methods and mostly treats two-dimensional flows, while it also keeps key arguments general enough to apply to the three-dimensional case as well. It also provides methods for solving model parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic equations, and two chapters address boundary-layer equations. The treatment of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow makes use of the en method. Further topics are grid generation methods and extensive discussions of the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f10e0ccb804cc1da96503dd38f2b7f4d9a807a6","amp;dn":"Computational+Fluid+Dynamics+for+Engineers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f10e0ccb804cc1da96503dd38f2b7f4d9a807a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,16,224,204,184,4,204,29,169,101,3,221,56,242,183,244,217,168,7,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
