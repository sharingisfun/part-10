The arc was originally conceived of by producer Graham Williams, who had proposed it as part of his application for the producer's job in 1976. The name refers to the powerful artifact whose segments the Doctor, Romana and K-9 are searching for during the season.\n\nA figure calling himself the White Guardian commissions the Doctor and K9, assisted by a new companion, the Time Lady Romana, to find the six segments of the Key to Time, a cosmic artifact resembling a perfect cube that maintains the equilibrium of the universe. Since it is too powerful for any single being to possess, it has been split into six different segments and scattered across space and time, disguised by the raw elemental power within them into any shape or size. However, since the forces balancing the universe are so upset, the White Guardian needs to recover the segments of the Key to stop the universe so that he can restore the balance.\n\nThe White Guardian also warns the Doctor of the Black Guardian who also wishes to obtain the Key To Time for his own purposes. In the final episode, the Black Guardian, disguised as the White Guardian, attempts to take the Key from the Doctor. However, the Doctor sees through the figure's charade and orders the segments of The Key to Time to once again become scattered across all of time and space, bar the sixth, which he reinstates as Princess Astra. Afterward, the Doctor decides to install a device called a randomizer into the TARDIS' navigation system for a period of time to make his following voyages unpredictable to evade the Black Guardian.\n\nThe six segments:\n\n    1. The first segment is disguised as a lump of Jethryk on the planet Ribos.\n    2. The second is the planet Calufrax, shrunk to miniature size by the space-\n       hopping pirate planet Zanak.\n    3. The third is the Great Seal of Diplos, which has been stolen by a criminal\n       of that planet.\n    4. The fourth is part of a statue on the planet Tara.\n    5. The fifth has been consumed by the squid Kroll, causing it to turn into a\n       gigantic monster.\n    6. The final segment is a female humanoid Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Princess Astra.\n\nTom Baker continued his role as The Fourth Doctor, and saw the introduction of Romana played by Mary Tamm. This season was the only one to feature Tamm as the first incarnation of Romana, as the second incarnation, played by Lalla Ward, began her run in the first serial of the next season (Destiny of the Daleks).\n\nEpisode List:\n\n1.
