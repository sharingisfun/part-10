All transfers are made digitally, providing NO sound quality loss.\n\nVersion 4.06 (15.05.07)\n* Fixed installer bug caused the driver to stay disabled after installation.\n* Removed a debug break instruction caused a bugcheck in rare cases.\n\n\nPLEASE, Rate Up!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de17864174e5ade9948aa2471ac1c19daed88158","amp;dn":"Virtual+Audio+Cable+aka+VAC+4.06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de17864174e5ade9948aa2471ac1c19daed88158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,23,134,65,116,229,173,233,148,138,162,71,26,193,193,157,174,216,129,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
