The story focuses on the turbulent and exciting period that the Beatles' spent in Hamburg, Germany in 1960-62, when they played in a series of rough-and-tumble dives and came into contact with cutting-edge artists. Among them was photographer Astrid Kirchherr, who helped shape the group's image, and with whom both John Lennon and former Beatle Stu Sutcliffe fell in love. Ultimately, Sutcliffe left the group, making way for the success of one of the greatest phenomena in rock music history.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:073902e7433f1f20c74f86545b5071bc344ecbc5","amp;dn":"Backbeat+1994+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"073902e7433f1f20c74f86545b5071bc344ecbc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,57,2,231,67,63,31,32,199,79,134,84,91,80,113,188,52,78,203,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
