Here is a book that carefully tells the story of how the human race got here in the first place.\n\nThis introductory information will have to start what will become a most amazing revelation, one which Zecharia Sitchin has already spelled out in his Earth Chronicle series. &quot;According to the Veda, vast empires waxed and waned in biochemical dishevels. Atlantis and Lemuria were the climax of great trade routes that stemmed from one corner of the world to the other. Atlantis' location was, as the name implies. A continent in the Atlantic. Lemuria was now only a chain of volcanic islands, and, if we read the tectonics correctly, the lost island of Mu of the Japanese. Ms. Lana Cantrell. Cantrell brought to her study of pre-history not only an open mind (a major pre-requisite) but also an extensive background in medical writing and reporting, which enabled her to offer unique insights on many mysteries of pre-history -- insights we have never seen before, and may never see again.\n\nDr. Lana Cantrell was born in Salzburg, Austria, and now lives in a suburb of the Twin Cities in MN. She is a member of the American Association of the Advancement of Science, American Institute of Biological Science, American Holistic Medical Foundation, Paleopathology Association, and the Ancient Astronaut Society. Eight years of exhaustive research has revealed the true history of mankind, hidden in the ancient texts of the Egyptian, Sumerian, Indian and Hebrew peoples.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2891fe722fc762d12358b8d8cad69183678657","amp;dn":"Lana+Cantrell+-+The+Greatest+Story+Never+Told","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2891fe722fc762d12358b8d8cad69183678657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,40,145,254,114,47,199,98,209,35,88,184,216,202,214,145,131,103,134,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
