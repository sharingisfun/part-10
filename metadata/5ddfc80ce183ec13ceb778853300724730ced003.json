It was created using the &quot;veryslow&quot; preset, the second highest quality preset.\r\n\r\nUsing a spare 6 core Athlon 2.4Ghz PC, it required 11 days for the entire operation! I have to say that I think x265 has done a superb job (your uploader was patient) and has rendered a very, very good 1080p version of the blu-ray, in just over 2.1 Gb; the only snag was that it needed over 11 days to work this wonder!\r\n\r\nThe audio is a more conventional 5.1 AAC at 448kbps. Finally, the English, FranÃ§ais and EspaÃ±ol subtitles are included (soft coded). The SRT files are also included.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and please, please, continue to seed after you have download\r\n\r\nScreens:-\r\n \nhttps://postimg.org/image/rwf0od4b5/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/a0nup0zrl/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/s2ouyubvl/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/ruttn114h/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/8nupuo2w7/\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nCodec:                  h265 10 Bit LE\r\nChroma Format:          4:2:0\r\nFramerate:              23.976\r\nBitrate:                1200 Kbps average, max 3000 kbps\r\nResolution:             1920 x 1080 (1920 x 808 plus borders)\r\nMode:                   Progressive\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\n\r\nCodec:                  AAC 5.1\r\nBitrate:                448kbps\r\n\r\nSubtitles:\r\n\r\nFormat:                 Subrip SRT\r\nEncoding:               UTF-8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ddfc80ce183ec13ceb778853300724730ced003","amp;dn":"Munich+%282005%29+Blu-ray+1080p+HEVC+10+Bit+AAC+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ddfc80ce183ec13ceb778853300724730ced003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,223,200,12,225,131,236,19,206,183,120,133,51,0,114,71,48,206,208,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
