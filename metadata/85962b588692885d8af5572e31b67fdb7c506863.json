It was released on 13 March 2006 through Virgin Records in most countries on 13 March 2006, although it was released three days earlier in Australia (standard and special editions) and New Zealand (standard edition only). Illegal copies had previously been available on the Internet since 17 January 2006. The album has sold over 1.1 million copies worldwide.\nPlacebo had planned to record a more electronic, keyboard-driven sound on Meds; however, producer Dimitri Tikovoi suggested a back-to-basics approach, which Brian Molko recounted in Zero:\nIt was our producer's agenda really, which we didn't really know about until we got into the studio. [...] We were in a place that was very much about samplers and computers and vintage synthesisers. This recording session really became about playing again. We were in an old-school studio so there were no real tricks to hide behind.[citation needed]\nOn the theme of the record, Molko says:\nI think there's a lot of songs about the dangers and effects of drinking [alcohol]. [...] &quot;Infra-red&quot;'s about that, when you get very drunk and you've got a bee in your bonnet about something, and this vengeful quality emerges. You start thinking about people who've done you wrong and [want] to set the record straight\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Alternative rock\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracklist:\nSide A\n1. Meds\n2. Infra-Red\n3.
