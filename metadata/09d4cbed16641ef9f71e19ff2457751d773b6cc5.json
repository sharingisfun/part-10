Of course we all know it is Peter Sellers no matter which twist is being used, this one clearly makes it's game part of the story. I don't think there is even a sense that he's supposed to be a master of disguise, as few of his fellow characters seem to fall for it - only the most important one - or incidental bumpings into.\n\nThe Naked Truth is a scandal rag that never seems to get published, as the publisher uses its contents for blackmail, which is supposedly just as lucrative as publishing it.  Save the trees!\n\nA couple of other familiar faces contribute to the cast, Terry Thomas and Dennis Price.\n\nFavorite line:\n\nHe's one of those plainclothes brutes dressed as an ordinary policeman.\n\nNo subtitles, sorry.\n\nUncompressed PAL DVD5 VIDEO_TS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09d4cbed16641ef9f71e19ff2457751d773b6cc5","amp;dn":"Peter+Sellers+-+The+Naked+Truth+%5BYour+Past+Is+Showing%5D+%281957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09d4cbed16641ef9f71e19ff2457751d773b6cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,212,203,237,22,100,30,249,247,30,25,255,36,87,117,29,119,59,108,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
