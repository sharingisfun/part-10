This adds  something which  is \n   probably the most important part  of the special sound: The  harmonic lines \n   are &quot;widened&quot; by  the effect of  frequency modulation due  to flutter which \n   causes a 'thickening' of the audio signal contributing to the fat sound  of \n   analog, compared  to the  more accurate,  but thin  sound of  digital. This \n   effect called `Modulation noise makes it easier to mix tracks together  by \n   removing  the static  character especially  of electric/electronic  sounds. \n   Its interesting to  know that many  natural instruments have  a &quot;built-in&quot; \n   flutter effect which strongly contributes to their sound. \n             \n   The distortion and compression effects due to the saturation characteristic \n   of  magnetic  recording  depend  on the  input  signal  level.  With normal \n   recording levels the  distortion is around  1% which is  away from sounding \n   really distorted but quite audible and adds a pleasant color to the  sound. \n   Higher values should only be used as special effect on some suitable tracks \n   dependant  on the  style of  music youre  after. The  saturation is  also \n   responsible for  the `instant  compression effect  which causes  transient \n   signals to be reduced in level. In contrast to a dedicated compressor  this \n   one  is  working with  instant  attack/release and  therefore  avoiding the \n   typical pumping artefacts. \n             \n             \n             \n   VTAPE Flanger \n             \n             \n   - Manual tape flanging simulation. \n   - Authentic through zero Flanging. \n   - Unique stereo flanging mode. \n             \n             \n   VTAPE Saturator \n             \n             \n   - Realistic tape emulation \n   - Tape saturation / compression. \n   - Automatic gain compensation \n   - Tape hiss \n   - Wow &amp; Flutter \n   - Equalizer \n   - Aliasing free distortion \n   - Zero latency operation \n   - Easy user interface one page only. \n             \n             \n   VTAPE Delay \n             \n             \n   - Based on VTAPE Saturator \n   - Unique step-sequencer style delay pattern input \n   - Modern tempo-synced delay with up to 16 taps per channel. \n   - Independent level control for each tap. \n   - Stereo rotation effect \n   - Tap Pad for tempo tapping \n   - Loop filter Lo/Mid/High \n   - All parameters tweakable in realtime without clicks \n   - Zero latency operation \n   - Easy user interface. \n             \n             \n             \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.virsyn.de&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.virsyn.de&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af7e09caca5d57bcd63d28c340c6723d1d6f43c","amp;dn":"VirSyn.VTape.VST.RTAS.v1.3.0-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af7e09caca5d57bcd63d28c340c6723d1d6f43c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,247,224,156,172,165,213,123,205,99,210,140,52,12,103,35,209,214,244,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
