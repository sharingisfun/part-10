It uses a case study approach, guiding readers through realistic design problems, and referring back to these cases at the end of each chapter. Throughout, the author uses shortcut techniques that allow engineers to obtain the whole focus for a design in a very short period (generally less than two days)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4720b9599d703dd7c5f84842e2b33a614cc706b0","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Design+of+Chemical+Process+-+James+M.+Douglas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4720b9599d703dd7c5f84842e2b33a614cc706b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,32,185,89,157,112,61,215,197,248,72,66,226,179,58,97,76,199,6,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
