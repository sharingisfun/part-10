It may be ridiculous to compile a series that's only 3 issues in, but this is:\n1) a unique self-publishing experiment\n2) a damn fine comic\n\nIf you enjoy this, I implore you to do as I have done, and go buy an issue (or all the issues) at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://panelsyndicate.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://panelsyndicate.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand help fund the completion of this great story!  --STF\n\n------\n\nTHE PRIVATE EYE is a forward-looking mystery created by artist Marcos Martin (AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, DAREDEVIL) and writer Brian K. Vaughan (SAGA, Y: THE LAST MAN, and the TV adaptation of Stephen King's UNDER THE DOME) with colorist Muntsa Vicente.\n\nSet in a future where privacy is considered a sacred right and everyone has a secret identity, The Private Eye is a serialized sci-fi detective story for mature readers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26281d4652413cdac90992ef9d376c9e99d5c721","amp;dn":"THE+PRIVATE+EYE+001-003+%282013%29+%28digital+only%29+BRIAN+K.+VAUGHN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26281d4652413cdac90992ef9d376c9e99d5c721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,40,29,70,82,65,60,218,201,9,146,239,157,55,108,158,153,213,199,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
