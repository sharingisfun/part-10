Centered around the brother and sister duo of Elliot and Natalie Bergman, the Chicago-based Wild Belle often utilize Elliot's funk and reggae leanings as the leader of the Afro-pop ensemble NOMO (with whom Natalie has also toured). However, with songs largely based around Natalie's love of soul and melodic '60s pop, Wild Belle have a less frenetic, if still hypnotically languid take on NOMO's world fusion sound. In that sense, Isles has a kind of sultry, post-Amy Winehouse retro-soul aesthetic that's lightened by the sibling's own positive-minded, dance club hippie vibe. Tracks like the languid &quot;Keep You&quot; and the buoyant &quot;Shine&quot; largely work to showcase Natalie's cherubic croon by surrounding it with fuzzy synths, echoey percussion, and Elliot's own rootsy saxophone lines. Elsewhere, cuts like the shimmery, hip-swaying Ã¢â‚¬Å“TwistedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the old-school reggae-sounding Ã¢â‚¬Å“JuneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ help make Isles the perfect summer afternoon album, designed for doing nothing in particular besides soaking up the good vibes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:083c775f91c8338b156f0fbd767a0b5270d7e537","amp;dn":"Wild+Belle+-+Isles+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"083c775f91c8338b156f0fbd767a0b5270d7e537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,60,119,95,145,200,51,139,21,111,15,189,118,122,11,82,112,215,229,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
