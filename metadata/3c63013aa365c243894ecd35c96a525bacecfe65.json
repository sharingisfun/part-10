It is intended as a supporting reference of this standardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s route, providing background information on the underlying principles, basic ideas, presuppositions, and new notions. Examples are included to familiarize readers with this approach, to highlight problems and solutions, advantages and disadvantages. \n\n* The only book with background information on the direct route in pressure vessel design. \n* Contains many worked examples, supporting figures and tables and a comprehensive glossary of terms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c63013aa365c243894ecd35c96a525bacecfe65","amp;dn":"Pressure+Vessel+Design+-+The+Direct+Route","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c63013aa365c243894ecd35c96a525bacecfe65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,99,1,58,163,101,194,67,137,78,205,53,201,106,82,91,172,236,254,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
