Perfect to Me\n\n\nNo Covers Included\n\n \nAn expanded version of Al Green&amp;#039;s beloved GREATEST HITS (which was already bolstered from 10 tracks to 15 in 1995), this 21-song collection features all the tunes from the earlier editions, including his biggest singles--among them, the supremely romantic &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Stay Together&quot; and the beautifully weary &quot;Tired of Being Alone.&quot; The real draws of 2007&amp;#039;s DEFINITIVE GREATEST HITS are the additions of the plaintive &quot;Back Up Train,&quot; which finds the legendary soul singer in his formative late-&amp;#039;60s period, and the gently funky &quot;I Can&amp;#039;t Stop,&quot; from Green&amp;#039;s triumphant 2003 return-to-secular-form album of the same name. Although some fans may bristle at yet another tweaking of this top-notch compilation, DEFINITIVE succeeds at painting a bigger picture of Green&amp;#039;s impressive career.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8248fa82cd1618378ef8d47bc43a7384f790181","amp;dn":"Al+Green+-+Definitive+%28Greatest+Hits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8248fa82cd1618378ef8d47bc43a7384f790181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,36,143,168,44,209,97,131,120,239,141,71,188,67,167,56,79,121,1,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
