Born in Texas in 1910, he was a bluesman touring the South by the age of fifteen. As early as 1935, he was playing primitive electric-guitar models. But he shocked everyone with his 1942 debut single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMean Old World,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ playing bent notes, vibrato sobs and more wild new electric sounds that other guitarists hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even dreamed of. Walker invented a new musical language, from the urban flash of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Hustle Is OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the dread of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStormy Monday.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Through the Forties and Fifties, he led his suave L.A. jump-blues combo on classics such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re My Best Poker Hand,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Know Your Wig Is GoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLong Skirt Baby Blues.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
