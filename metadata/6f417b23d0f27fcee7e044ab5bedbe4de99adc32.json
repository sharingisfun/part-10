Algodoo is designed to encourage young peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own creativity, ability and motivation to construct knowledge. The synergy of science and art makes Algodoo as educational as it is entertaining. Algodoo applies a constructionists learning paradigm ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ learning by designing, constructing and exploring physical systems.\n\n    * Functionality: create and edit scenes using simple drawing tools, save and load scenes, start and stop simulation, interact with simulation by click, drag, tilt and shake. Add color traces, force and velocity vectors for enhanced visualization.\n    * Physics: rigid bodies, fluids, chains, gears, gravity, contacts, friction, restitution, springs, hinges, lock, motors, light rays, optics.\n    * User community: Algodoo has a large and active community where you can exchange your created scenes and simulation videos. Among the users are youths, animators, teachers and science centers.\n    * Portal: The algodoo.com portal is a wiki and thus enables educators to efficiently exchange ideas, lectures and scenes.\n    * Methods: Algodoo is based on the latest technologies for interactive multiphysics simulation, including variational mechanical integrators and high performance numerical methods. \n\n\nAlgodoo originates from &quot;Phun 2D Physics Sandbox&quot;, which was created by Emil Ernerfeldt in his computing science MSc project at UmeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ university. Phun took the internet with storm with its viralvideo. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.algodoo.com/wiki/About_Algodoo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.algodoo.com/wiki/About_Algodoo&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f417b23d0f27fcee7e044ab5bedbe4de99adc32","amp;dn":"Algodoo.v1.7.1.WinAll.-CRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f417b23d0f27fcee7e044ab5bedbe4de99adc32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,65,123,35,208,242,127,206,231,224,68,171,91,237,190,77,233,154,220,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
