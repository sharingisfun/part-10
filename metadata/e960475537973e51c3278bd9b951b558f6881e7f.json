Pictures are shown that are supposed to help you relate the meaning of the word to a concept.  (Not always effective for me.)\n-Then the word is shown in Simplified Chinese with Pinyin, and a native speaker says the word, then says the word within a sentence\n-There is NO English translation\n\nThis material is designed for Chinese in China.\n\nThe language is NOT spoken slowly for the benefit of a foreigner trying to learn Chinese.\n\nMany of these words are not ones that a person would use in daily life, but they are ones that a Chinese person will know the meaning of.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the files:\n\nI simply copied the files from the VCD, and then changed the extension from .dat to .mpg\n\nI am not providing the little introductory mpg.  There is really no point, it&amp;#039;s just a cartoon animation.\n\nI know there are better ways of doing this, but I&amp;#039;m still trying to find the right tool to do it better.  (Suggestions?)\n\nEach file is separate, so that you can download one, check it out, and then download, or not, the others.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSelf-serving stuff here......\n\nMy uploads may go slow at times.  It seems that some countries can download from me faster than others.  Nothing I can do about that.  I guess we just have to help each other out as much as we can.\n\nMy upload philosophy:\n\n\tI&amp;#039;ve got lots of stuff that I can put up.  But, limited bandwidth/HDD space.\n\t\t1.  So...\tI figure I&amp;#039;ll upload each torrent until: \n\t\t\t- a 4.0-5.0 ratio and/or \n\t\t\t- 10 seeders (besides me) and/or\n\t\t\t- it&amp;#039;s clear that noone is interested\n\t\t2.  Once I stop seeding, there is no guarantee that I will be able to reseed.\n\t\t3.  I&amp;#039;m not trying to be a dick.  I just figure everyone should know where I&amp;#039;m coming from.\n\nMy upload content:\n\n\tI won&amp;#039;t just be doing [Chinese Language][Learning].  I intend on doing many other related topics, such as:\n\t\t1.  [Chinese Language][Music]\n\t\t2.  [Chinese Language][Movie]\n\t\t3.  [Chinese Language][Book]\n\nSo, keep your eyes open for these words in the torrent name, or just click on my user name to see what&amp;#039;s up.\t\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComments/Thanks:\n\nLike anyone else, I appreciate comments, but they aren&amp;#039;t really necessary.\n\nThe best way you can thank me is by pointing me to, or creating torrents of, \n\t1.  Language\n\t2.  Philosophy\n\t3.  History\n\t4.  Good Jam Band Music (Live and Lossless for the win!!)\n\t5.  Other Helpful Stuff\n\nSecond best way you can thank me, is by downloading and seeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e960475537973e51c3278bd9b951b558f6881e7f","amp;dn":"%5BChinese+Language%5D%5BLearning%5D+Xueqian+300+Ci+-+.mpg+from+VCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e960475537973e51c3278bd9b951b558f6881e7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,96,71,85,55,151,62,81,195,39,139,217,185,81,181,88,246,136,30,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
