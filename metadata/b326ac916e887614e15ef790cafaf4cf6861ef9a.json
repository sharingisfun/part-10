Introducing Daisy Johanssen, reluctant hell-spawnÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nThe Midwestern resort town of Pemkowet boasts a diverse population: eccentric locals, wealthy summer people, and tourists by the busload; not to mention fairies, sprites, vampires, naiads, ogres and a whole host of eldritch folk, presided over by Hel, a reclusive Norse goddess.\n\nTo Daisy Johanssen, fathered by an incubus and raised by a single mother, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home. And as HelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enforcer and the designated liaison to the Pemkowet Police Department, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to her to ensure relations between the mundane and eldritch communities run smoothly.\n\nBut when a young man from a nearby college drownsÃ¢â‚¬â€and signs point to eldritch involvementÃ¢â‚¬â€the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s booming paranormal tourism trade is at stake. Teamed up with her childhood crush, Officer Cody Fairfax, a sexy werewolf on the down-low, Daisy must solve the crimeÃ¢â‚¬â€and keep a tight rein on the darker side of her nature. For if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever tempted to invoke her demonic birthright, it could accidentally unleash nothing less than Armageddon. \n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
