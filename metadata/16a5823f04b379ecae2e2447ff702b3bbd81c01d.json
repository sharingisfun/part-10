The manual allocates considerable space to the subject of &quot;coercive questioning&quot; and psychological and physical techniques. The original text stated that &quot;we will be discussing two types of techniques, coercive and non-coercive. While we do not stress the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them.&quot; After Congress began investigating human rights violations by U.S.-trained Honduran intelligence officers, that passage was hand edited to read &quot;while we deplore the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them so that you may avoid them.&quot; Although the manual advised methods of coercion similar to those used in the Abu Ghraib prison by U.S. forces, it also carried a prescient observation: &quot;The routine use of torture lowers the moral caliber of the organization that uses it and corrupts those that rely on itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16a5823f04b379ecae2e2447ff702b3bbd81c01d","amp;dn":"CIA+Human+Abuse+Resource+Exploit+Interrogation+Man.1983.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16a5823f04b379ecae2e2447ff702b3bbd81c01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,165,130,63,4,179,121,236,174,46,36,71,255,112,43,59,189,129,192,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
