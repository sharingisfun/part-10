Moving Co. is an American animated television series created by Kenny and Keith Lucas. It originally premiered on Fox on November 23, 2013, as part of Animation Domination High-Def, but was renewed for two additional seasons on FXX.\r\n\r\nThe series features the twins as work-shy animated counterparts of themselves, running a moving company out of their van. The series is roughly based on the creators' experiences as cable television installers.\r\n\r\nThe series revolves around identical twins Kenny and Keith Lucas (voiced by Kenny and Keith Lucas, respectively), who run a moving company called &quot;Lucas Bros Moving Co&quot; in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, out of their van after receiving it from their dead uncle. The two are shown to frequently consume marijuana, emitting a calm demeanor throughout the various escapades caused at their job. Scrawny and indolent, their customers are often apprehensive towards their weaknesses, but the brothers like to remind themselves &quot;that's why God made two of them.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61424e86048ec54c336af55510573066a5744941","amp;dn":"Lucas+Bros+Moving+Company+Complete+Seasons+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61424e86048ec54c336af55510573066a5744941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,66,78,134,4,142,197,76,51,106,245,85,16,87,48,102,165,116,73,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
