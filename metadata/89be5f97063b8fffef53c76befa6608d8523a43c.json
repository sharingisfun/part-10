This is the one that Stephen Colbert  won the 2014 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.\n\nFrom the wiki: &quot;Colbert addresses topics including Wall Street, campaign finance, energy policy, eating on the campaign trail, and the United States Constitution.&quot;\n\nIt's a hilarious audiobook.
