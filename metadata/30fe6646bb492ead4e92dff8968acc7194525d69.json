The Lobo character was created by Roger Slifer and Keith Giffen, and first appeared in Omega Men #3 (June 1983). Lobo is an alien, and works as an interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter. Lobo was Introduced - although initially rarely used - hardboiled villain in the 1980s, and remained in limbo until his revival as an anti-hero biker with his own comic in the early 1990s.\nThe character enjoyed a short run as one of DCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular characters throughout the 1990s. This version of Lobo was intended to be an over-the-top parody of the Marvel Comics superhero Wolverine. In issue #41 of Deadpool, a separate Marvel series, Lobo was parodied as &quot;Dirty Wolff&quot;, a large blue skinned man who drove a demonic motorcycle. He was also parodied in the Image Comics series Bloodwulf and as &quot;Bolo&quot; in the Topps Comics series Satan's Six.\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Keith Giffen said, &quot;I have no idea why Lobo took off... I came up with him as an indictment of the Punisher, Wolverine hero prototype, and somehow he caught on as the high violence poster boy. Go figure.&quot;\n\nLobo is the favorite DC Comics character of Stan Lee.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30fe6646bb492ead4e92dff8968acc7194525d69","amp;dn":"Lobo+v2+%2801+-+64+%26amp%3B+extras%29+%281993+-+1999%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30fe6646bb492ead4e92dff8968acc7194525d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,254,102,70,187,73,46,173,78,146,223,248,150,138,204,113,148,82,93,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
