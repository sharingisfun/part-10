Nash\nEnglish \n2011 \nISBN: 1933503610 \n366 pages \nPDF\n4.04 MB\n\nThis is not just a diet book or another step-by-step program, but rather a guide that will help you discover what works for you and how to develop strategies for change based on your own personal values and goals. The book incorporates the latest ideas from successful mindfulness and acceptance-based therapy approaches to weight management and health. This book will help you tailor nutrition, exercise, and stress management to uniquely meet your needs, and help you learn ways for managing emotions and thinking that can lead to achieving a richer, fuller, and more satisfying life. \n\nThe book is backed by current research and is based on behaviour-change principles that are proven and well established. It offers the latest information on common obstacles -- how to increase your motivation; what to do to overcome binge eating; how to make the most of social support; and meeting the challenges that real change presents. Unlike other books in the field it offers clear guidance in considering bariatric surgery. Helpful tips for using smartphone technology and web-based programs are featured throughout the book.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4feb1f8d68f3a83a4b5b9eada9cea337e377ae36","amp;dn":"Lose+Weight%2C+Live+Healthy%3A+A+Complete+Guide+to+Designing+Your+Ow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4feb1f8d68f3a83a4b5b9eada9cea337e377ae36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,235,31,141,104,243,168,58,75,91,158,173,169,206,163,55,227,119,174,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
