After years of reckless behavior, a heroin addiction and the destruction of her marriage, Strayed makes a rash decision. Haunted by memories of her mother Bobbi (Academy Award nominee Laura Dern) and with absolutely no experience, she sets out to hike more than a thousand miles on the Pacific Crest Trail all on her own. WILD powerfully reveals her terrors and pleasures as she forges ahead on a journey that maddens, strengthens, and ultimately heals her.\n\nDirector: Jean-Marc VallÃƒÂ©e\n\nWriters: Nick Hornby\n\nActors: Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Thomas Sadoski, Gaby Hoffman, Kevin Rankin, Michiel Huisman\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 59 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dbd68ddab44970bb233c2ada26b08eefecff4f1","amp;dn":"Wild.+Official+Featurette+%5BHD%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dbd68ddab44970bb233c2ada26b08eefecff4f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,189,104,221,171,68,151,11,178,51,194,173,162,107,8,238,254,207,244,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
