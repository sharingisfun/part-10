Wendt argues that states can view each other as enemies, rivals, or friends. He characterizes these roles as &quot;cultures of anarchy,&quot; which are shared ideas that help shape states' interests and capabilities. These cultures can change over time as ideas change. Wendt thus argues that the nature of international politics is not fixed, and that the international system is not condemned to conflict and war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2d0cc71d736885aeb0b681b09e0b97c45e3691","amp;dn":"Social+Theory+of+International+Politics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb2d0cc71d736885aeb0b681b09e0b97c45e3691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,45,12,199,29,115,104,133,174,176,182,129,176,158,11,151,196,94,54,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
