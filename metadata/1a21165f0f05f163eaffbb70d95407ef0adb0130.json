This book describes the exciting development of theories that say that we age because we are purposely designed to have a limited lifespan; we are programmed to age and die. This theory strongly suggests that we can find pharmaceutical agents that generally delay aging and age-related diseases like cancer and heart disease.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | Anthropology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a21165f0f05f163eaffbb70d95407ef0adb0130","amp;dn":"The+Evolution+of+Aging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a21165f0f05f163eaffbb70d95407ef0adb0130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,33,22,95,15,5,241,99,234,255,187,112,217,84,7,239,10,219,1,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
