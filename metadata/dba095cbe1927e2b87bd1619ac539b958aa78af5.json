This lab manual combines a visual approach with a modular organization to maximize learning. The lab practice consists of hands-on activities in the lab manual and assignable content in MasteringA&amp;PÃ‚Â®.\n\nThis program presents a better teaching and learning experience by providing:\n\nPersonalized learning with MasteringA&amp;P: Become engaged with assignable lab activities that help them visualize structures and understand processesÃ¢â‚¬â€all automatically graded.\n\nA visual approach and modular organization: The two-page modules seamlessly integrate text and visuals to guide your through lab activitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€with no page flipping.\n\nFrequent practice: Opportunities for practice include pre-lab questions (Before You Begin, Consider This), post-lab questions (Review Sheets), pencil-to-paper activities (clearly marked with a black triangle), and critical thinking questions (Making Connections). You have the opportunity to practice online with MasteringA&amp;P.\n\nLearning Outcomes that tightly coordinate with lab activities: The clean one-to-one correspondence between the numbered exercise-opening Learning Outcomes and the numbered two-page lab activity modules gives you an easy-to-follow learning path and instructors an easy vehicle for assessment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dba095cbe1927e2b87bd1619ac539b958aa78af5","amp;dn":"Visual+Anatomy+and+Physiology+Lab+Manual%2C+Main+Version+%5BPDF%5D+%5BSt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dba095cbe1927e2b87bd1619ac539b958aa78af5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,160,149,203,225,146,126,43,135,189,22,25,172,83,155,149,138,167,138,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
