(5:47)\n\nThere is a combustible quality about newcomer Rachael Yamagata that for a lot of listeners will call to mind Fiona Apple: A first spin of Happenstance can make you itch with the thrill of discovery, but it also leaves behind the impression that its singer is vaguely dangerous; which is exactly what makes these songs so absorbing. &quot;Everybody's talking how I can't be your love,&quot; she pouts in a melodically engineered stutter on opener &quot;Be Be Your Love,&quot; one of several tracks pairing her with a piano that seems to take the brunt of the punishment for her wrecked relationships. The rest of the disc unravels with similar heat: When she growls in her full-time rasp that &quot;(You've) worn me down/like a road/I did everything you told&quot; on the very infectious indie-rock leaning &quot;Worn Me Down,&quot; you believe her. But the less stormy numbers work as well, with &quot;1963&quot; coming off as flower-power pop grounded by a voice that knows better and &quot;I Want You&quot; wending its way through a fat, heartsick wallow to emerge someplace burnt in honesty. A late minute-long instrumental feels more tasteful than pretentious, adding to a monster of a debut already fueling hopes that happenstance--the term, not the album--will play a miniscule part in Yamagata's eventual output.\n\nCredits:\n\nEngineer, Mixed By: Jeff Juliano\nMastered By: Ted Jensen\nMixed By: John Alagia\nProducer: John Alagia (1 to 3, 5 to 14)\nVocals, Piano, Electric Piano, Keyboards, Synthesizer, Tambourine, Songwriter: Rachael Yamagata\n\nCatalog number written as 82876-50566-2RE1.\nTrack 14 is unlisted and plays after 3:20 of silence following track 13.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/06/rachael-yamagata/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/06/rachael-yamagata/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd91a4dd966ae8a778b40655db623070dff3b63","amp;dn":"Rachael+Yamagata...Happenstance%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd91a4dd966ae8a778b40655db623070dff3b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,217,26,77,217,102,174,138,119,139,64,101,93,182,35,7,13,255,59,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
