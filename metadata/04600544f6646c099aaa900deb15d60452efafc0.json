There are pessimistic priests, visionary socialists, crackpot academics, and an alleged murderer who controlled FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finances.\n\nPaul Strathern sets their lives and thoughts against the dramatic backdrop of great events Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the South Sea Bubble, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and the Great Crash. His lightly worn erudition makes Dr. StrangeloveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Game amazingly accessible, leaving readers enriched and enlightened.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04600544f6646c099aaa900deb15d60452efafc0","amp;dn":"Dr+Stragelove%27s+Game+-+A+Brief+History+Of+Economic+Genius+-+%5BQwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04600544f6646c099aaa900deb15d60452efafc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,96,5,68,246,100,108,9,154,170,144,13,235,21,214,4,82,239,175,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
