As such it is unique in presenting the essentials of 'hollow-state' electronics and valve amp design for engineers and enthusiasts in the familiar context of current best practice in electronic design, using only currently available components. The author's straightforward approach, using as little maths as possible, and lots of design knowhow, makes this book ideal for those with a limited knowledge of the field as well as being the standard reference text for experts in valve audio and a wider audience of audio engineers facing design challenges involving valves.\n\nDesign principles and construction techniques are provided so readers can devise and build from scratch designs that actually work. Morgan Jones takes the reader through each step in the process of design, starting with a brief review of electronic fundamentals relevant to valve amplifiers, simple stages, compound stages, linking stages together, and finally, complete designs. Practical aspects, including safety, are addressed throughout.\n\nThe third edition includes a new chapter on distortion and many further new and expanded sections throughout the book, including: comparison of bias methods, constant current sinks, upper valve choice, buffering and distortion, shunt regulated push-pull (SRPP) amplifier, use of oscilloscopes and spectrum analysers, valve cooling and heatsinks, US envelope nomenclature and suffixes, heater voltage versus applied current, moving coil transformer source and load terminations.\n\n* The practical guide to analysis, modification, design, construction and maintenance of valve amplifiers\n* The fully up-to-date approach to valve electronics\n* Essential reading for audio designers and music and electronics enthusiasts alike\n\n\n# Paperback: 640 pages\n# Publisher: Newnes; 3 edition (November 12, 2003)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0750656948\n# ISBN-13: 978-0750656948","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e9a8977cf06180e4733717fc482a06b36b05230","amp;dn":"Valve+Amplifiers%2C+3rd+Ed++%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e9a8977cf06180e4733717fc482a06b36b05230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,154,137,119,207,6,24,14,71,51,113,127,196,130,160,107,54,176,82,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
