But most significantly, I have been both the silence and the voice. It is the human voice that is the primary tool for change.&quot;\n\nEddie Lama\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\n&quot;THE WITNESS is one man's truth that cries out for mass exposure may be the most important and persuasive film about animals ever made.\n\n- Howard Rosenberg, Los Angeles Times\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nTHE WITNESS has been an official selection in 31 film festivals and received ten awards, including eight Best Documentary awards, a Best Short Film award, and a Best of Festival award.\n\nThe documentary has also been broadcast as part of the independent film showcases of several regional PBS stations, and via satellite on Link TV and Free Speech TV.\n\nTHE WITNESS has received extraordinary support from everyday people, who have thus far organized several hundred community screenings in nearly every U.S. state and all over the world, in venues ranging from libraries and churches to college campuses and movie theatres, often with theatre owners donating the space for the events.\n\nWith the help of caring people who wanted to bring THE WITNESS to the international community, Tribe of Heart has released foreign-language versions of The Witness in Spanish, French, German, Czech, Japanese, and Swedish. \n\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nBuy this movie and support the authors in their altruistic endeavors!\nDVD has multiple languages, including Spanish, French, and Japanese.
