Many critics consider the book to be one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, as well as one of the foremost Soviet satires, directed against a suffocatingly bureaucratic social order.\n\nPlease seed 1:1\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a527850ea52e61cb7e41f844da6665a5c5ec9f74","amp;dn":"Mikhail+Bulgakov+-+The+Master+and+Margarita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a527850ea52e61cb7e41f844da6665a5c5ec9f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,39,133,14,165,46,97,203,126,65,248,68,218,102,101,165,197,236,159,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
