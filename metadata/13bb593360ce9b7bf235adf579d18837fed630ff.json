The tunes are written by the great Carla Bley and features members of her working band at the time including Steve Swallow on Bass, Gary Windo on Saxes, Carla Bley on Keys augmented by Robert Wyatt on Lead Vocals and the great Chris Spedding on Guitars.\n\nCarla flirted with rock tunes with offbeat topics like first encounters, sexual inefficiencies, shouting back at unappreciative audinences, &quot;Boo To You Too!&quot; and a hilarious lampoon of Philip Glass, &quot;I&amp;#039;m A Mineralist&quot;.\n\nKudos for Nick Mason having the taste and vision to offer a venue for these wnderful songs.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13bb593360ce9b7bf235adf579d18837fed630ff","amp;dn":"Nick+Mason%5C%27s+Fictitious+Sports+%28Vinyl+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13bb593360ce9b7bf235adf579d18837fed630ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,187,89,51,96,206,155,123,242,53,173,245,121,209,136,55,254,214,48,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
