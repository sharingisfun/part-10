And with colorful but respectful and spacious arrangements by Richard Evans and Claus Ogerman, Getz and company show how strong pop material can be inspiring grist for the player's improvisational mill.\n\nThe original 11-track LP is topped off on CD by worthy outtakes of Ã¢â‚¬Å“A House Is Not a Home&quot; and &quot;In Between the Heartaches&quot; along with &quot;Tara's Theme&quot; by Max Steiner.\n\nThe Bacharach tunes are a perfect vehicle for Stan's smooth delivery. If you love Getz and Bacharach (or simply one of the two) this is a must-have. \n\n\n\nStan Getz \n\nWhat The World Needs Now:\nStan Getz Plays Bacharach and David\n\n1968\n\n \n\n  CD / 1998 / Remastered / VBR-V0\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.\tWives and Lovers \n\n2.\tWindows of the World \n\n3.\tThe Look of Love \n\n4.\tAny Old Time of Day \n\n5.\tAlfie \n\n6.\tIn Times Like These \n\n7.\tA House Is Not a Home [Master Take] \n\n8.\tTrains and Boats and Planes \n\n9.\tWhat the World Needs Now Is Love \n\n10.\tIn Between the Heartaches [Edited Master Take]\n\n11.\tWalk on By \n\n12.\tA House Is Not a Home [Alternate Take][#]\n\n13.\tIn Between the Heartaches [Alternate Take][#]\n\n14.\tMy Own True Love \n\n15.\tTara's Theme [#] \n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nStan Getz: tenor saxophone\n\nChick Corea, Herbie Hancock: Piano\n\nKenny Burrell, Jim Hall, Phil Upchurch: guitar\n\nRon Carter, Walter Booker: bass\n\nCurtis Prince, Grady Tate, Roy Haynes: drums\n\nwith string and brass orchestras,\narranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman and Richard Evans\n \n\n\nStan Getz \nWhat The World Needs Now:\nStan Getz Plays Bacharach and David\n1968\n\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ef37370cfca0b0b121c6d470015454f63d0901","amp;dn":"Stan+Getz+plays+Bacharach+and+David+%281968%29+%2B+Bonus+%2F+V0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4ef37370cfca0b0b121c6d470015454f63d0901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,239,55,55,12,252,160,176,177,33,198,212,112,1,84,84,246,61,9,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
