Best known for their smash hit from the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack, 'Disco Inferno' (their only Top 20 appearance on the pop charts), the group had many other hits on the R&amp;B charts, which were just as deserving of crossover success. \nJust about any track from the excellent This Is Where All the Happy People Go: The Best of the Trammps compilation is a solid example of '70s R&amp;B at its finest and most expertly crafted. Many overlooked and forgotten gems reside here, such as 'Hold Back the Night,' 'Trammps Disco Theme,' 'That's Where the Happy People Go,' and 'Zing Went the Strings of My Heart.' \nAdmittedly, the Trammps did seem to jump on the disco bandwagon, like so many other bands from this era, but the quality of the music never suffered. \nFor a representation of some of the '70s most underrated dance music, The Best of the Trammps simply can't be beat.
