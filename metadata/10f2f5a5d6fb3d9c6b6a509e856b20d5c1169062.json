Pritchett, Evelyn Hofer (photo) / 260p / 32 MB\n\nLondon of the mind, the heart, and the eye is displayed, discussed and dissected with eloquence and understated wit in this classic collaboration uniting the unfailingly elegant prose of V. S. Pritchett and the consistently revealing photographs of Evelyn Hofer.\n\nHere is a pithy and knowledgeable distillation of the London experience - a panorama of its history, art, literature, and daily life. Here is the city that Londoners know, a paradox of grandeur and grime, the locus of bustling markets and tranquil parks, of the ancient and modern, of palaces and pubs, of docks and railroad depots. As Pritchett observes, &quot;If Paris suggests intelligence, if Rome suggests the world, if New York suggests activity, the word for London is experience. This points to the awful fact that London has been the most powerful and richest capital in the world for several centuries. It has been, until a mere fifteen years ago, the capital of the largest world empire since the Roman and, even now, is the focal point of a vague Commonwealth. It is the capital source of a language now dominant in the world. Great Britain invented the language: London printed it and made it presentable.&quot;\n\nGreat Londoners of the past stalk these pages - Wren, Pepys, Defoe, Hogarth, Dickens, and of course, that consummate Londoner, Samuel Johnson, who said, &quot;No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life, for there is in London all that life can afford.&quot; And here, too, are the faces of the people inhabiting London today - milkmen and master mariners, dockers and shopkeepers, messengers, Chelsea pensioners, and, inevitably, the London bobby. There is, as well, an analysis of the Londoner himself, enigmatic and enduring, with his remote but insistent respect for law, royalty, and ritual, his affection for argument, his toleration of eccentrics. This new paperback of the original 1962 edition offers a loving tribute to a great city's past and present.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f2f5a5d6fb3d9c6b6a509e856b20d5c1169062","amp;dn":"London+Perceived+%28Photo+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f2f5a5d6fb3d9c6b6a509e856b20d5c1169062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,242,245,165,214,251,61,156,107,106,80,158,133,107,32,213,193,22,144,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
