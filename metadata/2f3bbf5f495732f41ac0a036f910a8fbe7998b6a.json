But when a horse - wounded by a hunter's arrow - has Scott flying his plane to British Columbia to attend to the animal, Ty tags along for the experience. Only Scott knows that there is a planned surprise party for Ty and that he has got to get them back to the ranch the same evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Caleb plans on getting a pay raise from Jack, who has quite a different idea about how to deal with his hired hand, while Val hires Amy to help get Apollo back on the show jumping circuit, causing a bit of friction between the two of them.\n\nAnd Lou struggles to find her maternal instincts when Marnie leaves her to look after Jerry Junior. And the older Fleming sister is also concerned that Jerry Junior might not be the only baby in her immediate future!\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Dec 6, 2009. According to the CBC website, the next episode will air on Jan 3, 2010. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f3bbf5f495732f41ac0a036f910a8fbe7998b6a","amp;dn":"Heartland.S03E09.Broken.Arrow.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f3bbf5f495732f41ac0a036f910a8fbe7998b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,59,191,95,73,87,50,244,26,192,160,54,249,16,168,251,231,153,139,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
