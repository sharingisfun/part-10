That is the meditation. Dance so deeply that you forget completely that ?you? are dancing and begin to feel that you are the dance. The division must disappear; then it becomes a meditation.\n\nIf the division is there, then it is an exercise: good, healthy, but it cannot be said to be spiritual. It is just a simple dance. Dance is good in itself ? as far as it goes it is good. After it, you will feel fresh, young. But it is not meditation yet. The dancer must go, until only the dance remains?. Don?t stand aside, don?t be an observer. Participate!\n\nAnd be playful. Remember the word playful always ? with me it is very basic.? Osho\t\t\n\t\n\nFirst Stage: 40 minute\n\nWith eyes closed, dance as if possessed. Let your unconscious take over completely. Do not control your movements or witness what is happening. Just be totally in the dance.\n\nSecond Stage: 20 minutes\n\nKeeping your eyes closed, lie down immediately. Be silent and still.\n\nThird Stage: 5 minutes\n\nDance in celebration and enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8eff66ac4eebd5612345d53630ffaab28e3ea4f","amp;dn":"Osho+-+Nataraj+meditation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8eff66ac4eebd5612345d53630ffaab28e3ea4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,239,246,106,196,238,189,86,18,52,93,83,99,15,250,171,40,227,234,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
