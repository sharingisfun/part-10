Every Soldier develops a special level of situational awareness simply due to exposure to events occurring\nin their Area of Operations (AO) and has the opportunity to collect information by observation and interaction with the\nenvironment and the population. The increased situational awareness that soldiers develop through personal contact and \nobservation is a critical element of the Brigade and Battalion&amp;#039;s ability to more fully understand, react to, and control \nthe operational environment.\n\nOn today&amp;#039;s battlefield, information dominance is crucial and the soldier is the Commander&amp;#039;s most valuable weapon. By \ndiligently observing the environment the soldier will be able to identify and report objects, people and events which\ncontribute to Command&amp;#039;s full understanding of the AO. Things worth reporting include objects which are dangerous or seem\nout of place, people who are behaving in a suspicious manner, and things which are obviously related to enemy activity \n(such as weapons, explosives and uniforms). As information is being reported by all soldiers, Command may then be able to\nput together seemingly disparate information to attain a more complete view of the AO and will be better able to direct \nsoldiers in the field.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe McKenna MOUT site is the location where training in the concept of Every Soldier a Sensor will occur. \nPlayers must use key clues to find an IED cache while engaging enemy targets in a timed environment. A Go or No-Go will \nbe given based on number of suspicious objects observed and reported, time of completion, and number of enemy targets engaged. \nSuccessful completion of the ES2 training will allow players to accrue points for observing and reporting suspicious objects \nwithin the ES2 Border Co-operative Multiplayer level.\n\n\n\nES2 Border (Multiplayer Co-Op)\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Intelligence has identified this small border village as a hotbed for hostile activity and the likely source of IEDs used\nin recent attacks. The local population is a mix of insurgents, sympathizers and pro-democracy civilians. The sprawling \nvillage borders a highway which will be used increasingly in the coming months for friendly troop and supply transport. \nIt is imperative that the insurgency here is addressed with as little negative impact as possible on civilian infrastructure \nand that any IED related activity be eliminated.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis version of the Border level hosts a co-operative mission where a small village area with low hills is home to an armed \ngroup of insurgents. Teams are encouraged while on patrol to be on the lookout for suspicious objects which may lead to clues \nabout current activity within the village. \n\n=======================================================\nSystem Requirements (have not changed):\n=======================================================\n\nThe current Minimum System Requirements for AA:SF (Overmatch) are as follows:\n\n- 3-D graphics card with 128 MB memory and support for hardware transformation and lighting\n- 2.4 GHz processor or equivalent\n- English version of Windows(r) 2000/XP Operating System with latest updates\n- 512 MB RAM\n- 3.5GB of uncompressed hard disk space for game files\n- 4X DVD-ROM (not required for downloaded installations)\n- Windows 2000/XP compatible system (including compatible 32-bit drivers for CD-ROM drive, video card, sound card, \nmouse and keyboard)\n- DirectX(r)9.0\n- 100% Compatible DirectX 9.0 soundcard\n- 56kbps Modem or other network connection\n- *NvidiaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® nForceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ or other motherboard/soundcards containing Dolby DigitalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Content Encoder required for \nDolby DigitalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® audio.\n\n\nThe current Recommended System Requirements for AA:SF (Overmatch) are as follows:\n\n\n- 3-D graphics card with 256 MB memory and support for hardware transformation and lighting\n- 3.0 GHz processor or equivalent\n- English version of Windows(r) 2000/XP Operating System with all updates\n- 1 GB RAM\n- 3.5GB of uncompressed hard disk space for game files\n- 4X DVD-ROM (not required for downloaded installation)\n- Windows 2000/XP compatible system (including compatible 32-bit drivers for CD-ROM drive, video card, \nsound card, mouse and keyboard)\n- DirectX(r) 9.0\n- 100% Compatible DirectX 9.0 soundcard\n- Broadband Network Connection \n- NVIDIA(r) nForce(tm) or other motherboards/soundcards containing the Dolby(r) Digital Interactive \nContent Encoder required for Dolby Digital audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:287de3dd3ef31967f5665015d2ab088fdf63550a","amp;dn":"America%5C%27s+Army+2.8.4+full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"287de3dd3ef31967f5665015d2ab088fdf63550a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,125,227,221,62,243,25,103,245,102,80,21,210,171,8,143,223,99,85,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
