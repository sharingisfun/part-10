The band split up after Schuldiner's death in 2001.\n\n-------------------------------\nScream Bloody Gore is the first album released by Death in 1987. This album bears little resemblance to the far more technical works of the band. Chuck Schuldiner plays bass, wrote all the songs on the album and provides vocals in addition to guitar for the album. John Hand is noted on the cover as playing 'rhythm', though this was incorrect and Hand was only in the band for a short period and was not on the recording. This is also the only Death album to feature drummer Chris Reifert, who had joined for the Mutilation demo.\n--------------------------------\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Infernal Death&quot; - 2:54\n   2. &quot;Zombie Ritual&quot; - 4:35\n   3. &quot;Denial of Life&quot; - 3:37\n   4. &quot;Sacrificial&quot; - 3:43\n   5. &quot;Mutilation&quot; - 3:30\n   6. &quot;Regurgitated Guts&quot; - 3:47\n   7. &quot;Baptized in Blood&quot; - 4:31\n   8. &quot;Torn to Pieces&quot; - 3:38\n   9. &quot;Evil Dead&quot; - 3:01\n  10. &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot; - 4:35\n  11. &quot;Beyond The Unholy Grave&quot; - 3:08\n  12. &quot;Land Of No Return&quot; - 2:59\n---------------------------------\nCredits\n\n    * Chuck Schuldiner - Bass, Guitar, Vocals\n    * Chris Reifert - Drums\n    * Steve Sinclair - Executive Producer\n    * Edward Repka - Design, Illustrations\n    * Randy Burns - Percussion, Producer\n    * John Hand - Credited on album as rhythm guitar but did not actually play on album (or during any live performances)\n---------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46feba78c67dbb0a51432265202e5d6522bd2b58","amp;dn":"Death+-+1987+-+Scream+Bloody+Gore+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46feba78c67dbb0a51432265202e5d6522bd2b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,254,186,120,198,125,187,10,81,67,34,101,32,46,93,101,34,189,43,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
