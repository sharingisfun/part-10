According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainmentÃ¢â‚¬â€it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\n\nBut don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages. After reading this groundbreaking exposÃƒÂ©, readers will never watch television the same way again.\n\nAbout the Author:\nBen Shapiro has been a nationally syndicated columnist with Creators Syndicate since 2002 and is the bestselling author of Brainwashed (Nelson Current, 2004) and Porn Generation (Regnery, 2005).  He is a frequent guest on television and radio shows across the nation; his columns are printed weekly in newspapers and websites from coast to coast.
