Breaking new ground beyond its successful predecessor, The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error guides you through the traps and misconceptions of the old view. Sidney Dekker presents the view that human error is an organizational problem, and suggests how to apply new theories to your organization, handling questions about accountability and constructing meaningful countermeasures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61fe8cb8f521f76fb30f36eec24021fe8e2017e2","amp;dn":"The+Field+Guide+to+Understanding+Human+Error+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61fe8cb8f521f76fb30f36eec24021fe8e2017e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,254,140,184,245,33,247,111,179,15,54,238,194,64,33,254,142,32,23,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
