All the bloody regimes and movements of the twentieth century are masterfully captured here, from Stalin's Soviet Union, Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and Franco's Spain through to the modern scourge of terrorism. Eloquently and persuasively combining an authoritative survey of history with a timely reminder of the dangers of radical secularism, Burleigh asks why no one foresaw the religious implications of massive Third World immigration, and he deftly investigates what are now driving calls for a civic religion to counter the terrorist threats that have so shocked the West.\n \n\n2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f64eb6d280a96f923932eab136848e3099c86cb","amp;dn":"Sacred+Causes%3A+The+Clash+of+Religion+and+Politics+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f64eb6d280a96f923932eab136848e3099c86cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,100,235,109,40,10,150,249,35,147,46,171,19,104,72,227,9,156,134,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
