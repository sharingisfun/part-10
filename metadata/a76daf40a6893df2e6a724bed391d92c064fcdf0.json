Jimi takes no vocals on any \nof the six tracks, preferring instead to let his guitar cry and sing. \nThis is a brilliant example of Jimi&amp;#039;s fluid improvisational genius. He \nplaying is ratcheted up another notch in the fertile jam-session \nsetting of these astounding recordings, which showcase his creative \nenergy and virtuosity. We are able to hear Hendrix thinking aloud, and \nhe consistently astounds the listener with the force of his ideas. He \npairs up on one track with legendary jazz organist Larry Young (who \nplayed with Miles Davis on Bitches Brew), creating a jazz-rock \nmasterpiece that outshines in intensity anything recorded by latter day\nguitar heroes. The electrifying interplay that he and Young achieve \nleaves one wondering what kind of music Jimi could have made with Miles\nDavis, had he not died just one week before they were scheduled to \nrecord together in a London studio. This session hints strongly at one \nof the many possible directions Jimi&amp;#039;s music was headed prior to his \ntragic death in September 1970.\n\nffp:\njimi1969-00-00t01.flac:ca3b615302773996c94b5accb9be0eba\njimi1969-00-00t02.flac:cd127f6f7c3eb78ad5a5745abe681f76\njimi1969-00-00t03.flac:d25c583070c5c66b48633ae3a97db1cc\njimi1969-00-00t04.flac:152bae54eb8e4444d3a1dea892802454\njimi1969-00-00t05.flac:d01dcb8866cced6ccc52c3bf82ab4a9b\n\n\n    length     expanded size   cdr  WAVE  probs   filename\n      8:48.30       93209804     ---   --    -xx    jimi1969-00-00t01.flac\n    10:38.32     112618508     ---   --    -xx    jimi1969-00-00t02.flac\n      8:07.21       85956236     ---   --    -xx    jimi1969-00-00t03.flac\n      4:27.06       47112956     ---   --    -xx    jimi1969-00-00t04.flac\n      6:20.02       67036748     ---   --    -xx    jimi1969-00-00t05.flac\n    38:21.16     405934252 B                      \n(totals for 5 files, 0.5165 overall compression ratio)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76daf40a6893df2e6a724bed391d92c064fcdf0","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-Nine+to+the+Universe-+Reprise+vinyl+rip+CD.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76daf40a6893df2e6a724bed391d92c064fcdf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,109,175,64,166,137,61,242,230,167,36,190,211,145,217,44,6,79,205,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
