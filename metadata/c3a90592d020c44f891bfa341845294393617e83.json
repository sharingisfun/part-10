Case \n\nSubjects:  Audio + Music, Mixing, Music Production, Audio Foundations, Audio Effects, \nSoftware:  Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Waves, \n\n2h 27m Appropriate for all Jan 18, 2012, Updated Jan 31, 2014 | Uploaded in Feb 10, 2015 by 2boweb\n\n\nIn this installment of Foundations of Audio, author Alex U. Case explains the fundamentals of delay and modulation effects and how to apply these effects, technically and creatively, to improve the sound of a mix. The course covers adjusting individual parameters such as delay time, level, and feedback; working with long delays to create echoes, enhance groove, and add support; using delay modulation for chorus and doubling effects; and dialing-in spectral effects from delay, such as flanging. This course also includes Get in the Mix (GITM) sessions for both Avid Pro Tools and Apple Logic Pro. Exercise files are also included with the course.\nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdjusting the delay time, level, and feedback parameters\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUtilizing a low-pass filter and polarity reverse\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tSetting up an effects loop\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tSetting the delay time by tempo or by ear\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUnderstanding the distinct uses of short, medium, and long delays\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdjusting modulation rate, depth, and shape\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdding double tracking and spreader effects\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tManipulating tone with constructive or destructive interference\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating a comb filter and flange effect\n\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a90592d020c44f891bfa341845294393617e83","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Foundations+of+Audio%3A+Delay+and+Modulation+with+Alex+U.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a90592d020c44f891bfa341845294393617e83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,169,5,146,208,32,196,79,137,27,250,52,24,69,41,67,147,97,126,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
