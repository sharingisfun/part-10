Led by Chazz Coghlan (vocals, keyboards) and Paul Hutchinson (vocals, keyboards), the quartet was rounded off by guitarist Nielson Kearon and bassist Gordon Goodwin (sessionman Dennis Conway occupied the drum stool). With the album produced by the legendary Roy Thomas Baker (and featuring backing vocals by Flo &amp; Eddie), there was an initial interest with leadoff track &quot;The Sound of Breaking Hearts&quot; garnering some airplay across the country. Espionage&amp;#039;s mix of British synth pop (ÃƒÂ  la Heaven 17) and commercial rock (courtesy of Roy Thomas Baker&amp;#039;s perfect production) on paper would seem like a mismatch, but this album proves that you can have the best of both worlds.  \n\n\nReleased:\t1983\nGenre:\tElectronic, Pop \nStyle:\tSynth-pop \nCredits:\tBacking Vocals [Additional] - Howard Kaylan , Mark Volman \nBass - Gordon Goodwin \nDrums [Additional] - Dennis Conway \nEngineer - Gordon Fordyce \nGuitar, Backing Vocals - Nielson Kearon \nMastered By - George Marino \nProducer, Mixed By - Roy Thomas Baker \nVocals, Synthesizer - Paul Hutchinson \nVocals, Synthesizer, Piano, Percussion - Chazz Coghlan \n\n \nTracklisting:\n\n01\t \tThe Sound Of Breaking Hearts\n02\t \tYour Love Is For Sale\n03\t \tThe Great Escape\n04\t \tFreedom\n05\t \tMiracles\n06\t \tLiving Under Rocks\n07\t \tGood Things Don&amp;#039;t Go On Forever\n08\t \tI Never Meant To Make You Cry (I&amp;#039;m Sorry)\n09\t \tCan&amp;#039;t You Feel My Heartbeat\n10\t \tShips Across The Night\n11\t \tOne Night Stand\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b1c5094ffffdbcb7b8276e3b9be84f956400c6a","amp;dn":"Espionage+-+Self-titled+%5B1983+Synth-pop%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b1c5094ffffdbcb7b8276e3b9be84f956400c6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,28,80,148,255,255,219,203,123,130,118,227,185,190,132,249,86,64,12,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
