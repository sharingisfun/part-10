The titular character, Ghita of Alizarr, is a barbarian warrior like Red Sonja. Like Sonja, Ghita's generally garbed in an armored bikini, but frequently less than that. The story maintains a classic erotic comic fantasy adventure theme, showcasing Thorne's talent for illustrating 'pinup-style' warrior women and detailed settings. Even with the sexual nature of many scenes, the series is generally considered erotic as opposed to pornographic.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Thorne&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Thorne&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlso available by Frank Thorne...\n\nRibit! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8394236/Frank_Thorne_-_Ribit__(Restored)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8394236/Frank_Thorne_-_Ribit__(Restored)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b55c79375d13923774efc5f876b11689bf47fe9","amp;dn":"Frank+Thorne+-+The+Complete+Ghita%2C+Ghita+of+Alizarr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b55c79375d13923774efc5f876b11689bf47fe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,85,199,147,117,209,57,35,119,78,252,95,135,107,17,104,155,244,127,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
