New versions of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœTheme For Great CitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ were released, &amp; some copies (such as the U.S. version), included the remixes by Raven Maize.\nA new edition was released in November 2007 with an extra DVD of the Verona concert film.\nThe SACD version of The Best Of was prepared from the remastered album. Therefore thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little difference between the SACD mix &amp; that of the remaster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53bda60679a7053380a1a97268daa5a6ad591c56","amp;dn":"Simple+Minds+-+The+Best+Of+Simple+Minds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53bda60679a7053380a1a97268daa5a6ad591c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,189,166,6,121,167,5,51,128,161,169,114,104,218,165,166,173,89,28,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
