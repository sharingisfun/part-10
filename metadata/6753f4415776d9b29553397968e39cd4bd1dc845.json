Ben Klemens introduces a set of open and unlimited tools, and uses them to demonstrate data management, analysis, and simulation techniques essential for dealing with large data sets and computationally intensive procedures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6753f4415776d9b29553397968e39cd4bd1dc845","amp;dn":"Modeling+with+Data%3A+Tools+and+Techniques+for+Scientific+Computin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6753f4415776d9b29553397968e39cd4bd1dc845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,83,244,65,87,118,217,178,149,83,57,121,104,227,156,212,189,29,200,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
