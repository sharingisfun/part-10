With their cameras holding him accountable for every aspect of his destructive lifestyle, they turn his stubborn resistance into iron resolve. As Geoff fought to regain his health amidst mounting complications, his sons battled against his years of poor diet, bad habits and ingrained negativity, with little more than hope and gritty determination to get them through.\r\n\r\nThere are no quick fixes as the brothers attempt to transform their dad from a barely mobile night security guard to a fighting fit endurance cyclist and global speaker on defeating type 2 diabetes. With more than a third of adults in the UK pre-diabetic - and millions living with type 2 already - they show that if Geoff can do it, anyone can. Through humour, support and determination, the family reminds us that those we love make us strong and that a life we love is worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/Fixing-Dad-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/Fixing-Dad-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Fixing-Dad-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Fixing-Dad-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Fixing-Dad-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Fixing-Dad-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Fixing-Dad-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/Fixing-Dad-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/Fixing-Dad-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1691Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x544\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 770 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07m8nzd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10a003d1db541cbb186173ddb4bf706048703071","amp;dn":"BBC+Fixing+Dad+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10a003d1db541cbb186173ddb4bf706048703071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,160,3,209,219,84,28,187,24,97,115,221,180,191,112,96,72,112,48,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
