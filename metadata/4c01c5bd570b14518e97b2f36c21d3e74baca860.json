Christopher Bedford is everyone's fantasy. \nHe's gorgeous, young, clever, rich, and above all, totally buffed and every boy in \nBoston seems to want him. At thirty-one, he's gliding through life, celebrating \nhimself as the 90's gay playboy ideal, without ever realizing what a mess he's become.\n\nA viewer Review:\n \nThis movie IS poorly acted and put together, but it's unique in its subject matter, \nand I think that makes it worth seeing.\nThis is supposedly a satire of the shallowness of certain types of gays \n(they're called &quot;twinks,&quot; &quot;Gym Bunnies&quot; and &quot;Chelsea Boys&quot; where I am) who are rich, overly groomed and superficial. It follows one guy, a shallow heartbreaker, as he falls in love with someone not of his &quot;class.&quot;\n\nA HUGE problem is the acting. I felt that a lot of the lines would have been funny if the actors could have sold them well. With a satire like this, the actors need to go at lines like &quot;Are you telling me you dated someone who doesn't work out?&quot; with absolutre sincerity, but what we get is a sort of &quot;I'm just an actor, I'm not really like this, see&quot; kind of irony. It kills the entire script. Lines that were funny when I read them in a review are absolutely flat on screen. One gets the impression the director asked his friends to be in the movie, and the result is the slightly embarrassed feeling of watching community theater.\n\nThematically, the movie is VERY tame. It doesn't really go far in satirizing its \ncharacters, and ends up in some ways reinforcing their viewpoints. A character \nwho is not rich and doesn't work out is seen as SO DIFFERENT it's SHOCKING that our \nmain character would even BE SEEN with him! So much for embracing diversity, huh? \nNear the end our protagonist is upbraided for not calling a guy when he said he \nwould and basically being a playboy. Since when is this a crime in gay circles? \nDid he say he was a virgin and that they would be married? The effect one leaves \nthe theater with is oe of those superficial types saying (and we've all heard it) \n&quot;Oh I'm so superficial, it's awful&quot; when you know they don't really mean it and \nwon't change. I was curious to see WHO would go to see this movie, and was \ndisappointed to see it's the very audience the movie pretends to criticize. \nThey seemed absolutely unfazed.\n\nBut the fact that this movie DOES examine these attitudes at all I think makes \nit worth a viewing. It's one of those that's better to talk about than to \nsit through. And, if you're attracted to those kinds of hairless chiseled body \ntypes, there is ample chest on display... though if you're seeing the film for \nthat reason, anything it has to say, I suspect, would be irrelevant to you.\n\nenjoy the movie...\n\nand...\n\ndon't forget:\n\nWe live in a very homophobic world full of prejudice and violence against LGBT community. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s change the world, reeducate the world in a good spirit! LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s explain directly and indirectly to people how important is to respect and treat the LGBT community just as everyone else. Spread the word! Share the movie with your straight and gay friends. A picture says a 1000 words. A Movie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ says a Million words.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c01c5bd570b14518e97b2f36c21d3e74baca860","amp;dn":"All+The+Rage+%281997%29+USA.+GAY+Interest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c01c5bd570b14518e97b2f36c21d3e74baca860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,1,197,189,87,11,20,81,142,151,178,243,108,33,211,231,75,172,168,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
