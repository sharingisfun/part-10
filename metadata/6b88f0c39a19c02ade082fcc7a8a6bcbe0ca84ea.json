When I published some essays on the internet about Rockefeller and the Illuminati, the secret history of the Illuminati, I had a call from this Ninja guy. He says: Oh boy, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve now done it. Now thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gonna be an earthquake in Niigata. The Americans are gonna use their earthquake machine. And boom, next day, two identical 6.8 earthquakes under JapanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest nuclear reactor happened.\n\nBF: And this is what Takenaka told me. He said: The reason I had to hand over the financial system was because they threatened us with their earthquake machine.&quot;\n\nThe son of a Canadian diplomat, Benjamin Fulford rebelled against his upbringing and at the age of 17 made his way by boat into the heart of the Amazon to live with a tribe of former cannibals. Continuing to seek answers and better understand Western society, he spent time in a self-sufficient community in Argentina before heading to attend university in Japan. Principled, brave, and still a diehard idealist after all these years, he resigned as Asia-Pacific Bureau Chief of Forbes Magazine after investigating a scandal which the editor refused to report. As he researched global affairs further in his own time, he uncovered for himself the complex web which is global financial control at the hands of the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds - and also the existence of racially targeted bioweapons such as SARS.\n\nIt was these plans for global depopulation that upset some important and powerful factions in Japan, Taiwan and China. After being approached by a real-life, present-day Ninja, matters came to a head in 2007 when Benjamin became the first Westerner for 500 years to be admitted into the ranks of the Eastern Secret Societies, a vast group with six million members. Acting as their spokesman, he stepped up to the plate to deliver a simple message to the Illuminati: &quot;Recognize that your time is over, step down without a fight, and allow the world to thrive as it should - or face the consequences from up to 100,000 professional assassins for whom no love is lost towards the self-styled ruling elite of the planet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b88f0c39a19c02ade082fcc7a8a6bcbe0ca84ea","amp;dn":"HAARP+-+Triggering+Earthquakes+in+Japan+-+Fulford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b88f0c39a19c02ade082fcc7a8a6bcbe0ca84ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,136,240,195,154,25,192,42,222,8,47,204,122,138,107,203,224,202,132,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
