Galileo and 400 Years of Telescopic Astronomy will feature the life and achievements of Galileo, around which has pivoted the story of four centuries of telescopic astronomy. The book will detail how astronomy has progressed through four centuries and contain glimpses of future space research and astronomy goals. Uniquely, interwoven with the text will be a range of practical projects for backyard astronomers in which to participate, projects that serve to illustrate many of Galileo\\'s scientific discoveries. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732fc06347ca4e093d2997e4930158e2abc0433d","amp;dn":"Galileo+and+400+Years+of+Telescopic+Astronomy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732fc06347ca4e093d2997e4930158e2abc0433d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,47,192,99,71,202,78,9,61,41,151,228,147,1,88,226,171,192,67,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
