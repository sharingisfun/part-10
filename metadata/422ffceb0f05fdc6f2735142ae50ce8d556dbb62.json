On Kulu the fifty-something guitarist drifts from background to foreground and back, though he tends toward a middle ground when vocalists are part of the mix.\n\nHalf of these tracks include female vocals, including most notably Bagayoko's wife and daughter on two tracks each. The elder Nahawa Doumbia's delivery has the signature features of Wassoulou region of Southern Mali, most widely popularized by contemporary vocalist Oumou SangarÃƒÂ©: piercing delivery, sustained phrasing, and a kind of insistence that's hard to refuse. They're not the soft, lush female vocals most familiar to Western audiences, instead full-bore outpourings of soul and emotion.\n\nVocalist Mai Sanogo (one track) sounds entirely tame in comparison, but Bagayoko's daughter has a sweet softness that still commands attention. The differences between the singers makes each new appearance a fresh experience. So do the rather understated studio tweaks, including vocal harmonies and effects.\n\nBagayoko is a veteran musician (as is his wife) and that experience is reflected in knowledge of where to step forward and where to hold back. The pieces without vocals are the most revealing, of course. Three come as entirely solo efforts, including the opening two tracks, which offer a warm welcome through pentatonic riffing and cycling. He's no virtuoso, but that's just plain not relevant.\n\nProponents of the theory that American blues has roots in Mali will find compelling evidence here. This is without question the finest of the Frikyiwa releases reviewed in this article.\n\nArt highlights: Beautiful flowing robes on Bagayoko and the singers; odd camouflage on Filifin. Multimedia: an interactive three-dimensional matrix of 27 short music/dance videos. Top-notch design by Manuel Tau and Patrick Doan.\n\n-- All About Jazz (allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=1889&amp;page=1)\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nPersonnel -\n\nN'Gou Bagayoko: Guitar, ka, carignan (album)\nNahawa Doumbia: Vocal (3, 9) \nRamatta Doussou: Vocal (5, 8) \nMai Sanogo: Vocal (4), concon barani (2, 6)\nMaimouna Keita: Water's calabash (4)\nFanta Kone: Concon barani (2, 6) \nFilifin: Kamele'n goni (4, 7) \n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nEAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nTQMP.
