Where will advancing technology, job automation, outsourcing and globalization lead? This groundbreaking book by a Silicon Valley computer engineer explores these questions and shows how accelerating technology is likely to have a highly disruptive influence on our economy in the near future--and may well already be a significant factor in the current global crisis. THE LIGHTS IN THE TUNNEL employs a powerful thought experiment to explore the economy of the future. An imaginary &quot;tunnel of lights&quot; is used to visualize the economic implications of the new technologies that are likely to appear in the coming years and decades. The book directly challenges conventional views of the future and illuminates the danger that lies ahead if we do not plan for the impact of rapidly advancing technology. It also shows how the economic realities of the future might offer solutions to issues such as poverty and climate change.\n\nFormat: epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:165feebb365ccab27f3de890e2a841ff79c3f6cf","amp;dn":"The+Lights+in+the+Tunnel+-+Automation%2C+Accelerating+Technology+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"165feebb365ccab27f3de890e2a841ff79c3f6cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,95,238,187,54,92,202,178,127,61,232,144,226,168,65,255,121,195,246,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
