It was the first US Beatles album to be issued by Capitol Records on 20 January 1964 in both mono and stereo formats. It topped the popular album chart on 15 February 1964 and remained at number one for an impressive eleven weeks before being replaced by The Beatles' Second Album, the first time that an artist replaced itself at the peak album position. The cover featured Robert Freeman's portrait used in the United Kingdom for With the Beatles, with a blue tint added to the original stark black-and-white photograph.\n\nAll thirteen unique albums released by Capitol Records are included in the box set, eight of which were previously released in The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2. The set contains remastered mono and stereo versions of each album. Shortly after the initial announcement, Capitol Records revealed that the new remasters for the US versions of the albums are partially based on the original 1960s masters and the 2009 remasters released in The Beatles Stereo Box Set and The Beatles in Mono. Unique stereo and mono mixes prepared in the UK for US release are sourced from the original tapes.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nMONO &amp; STEREO - REMASTERS\n\n01. \t&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;   \tJohn and Paul \t2:24\n02. \t&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;   \tPaul \t2:50\n03. \t&quot;This Boy&quot;   \tJohn, Paul, and George \t2:11\n04. \t&quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;   \tJohn with Paul 2:11\n05. \t&quot;All I've Got to Do&quot;   \tJohn \t2:04\n06. \t&quot;All My Loving&quot;   \tPaul \t2:04\n07. \t&quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; (George Harrison) \tGeorge \t2:28\n08. \t&quot;Little Child&quot;   \tJohn \t1:46\n09. \t&quot;Till There Was You&quot; (Meredith Willson) \tPaul \t2:12\n10. \t&quot;Hold Me Tight&quot;   \tPaul \t2:30\n11. \t&quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;   \tRingo \t1:59\n12. \t&quot;Not a Second Time&quot;   \tJohn \t2:03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b916f6bee0540a496277db45137ca68aaa920487","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Meet+The+Beatles+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b916f6bee0540a496277db45137ca68aaa920487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,22,246,190,224,84,10,73,98,119,219,69,19,124,166,138,170,146,4,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
