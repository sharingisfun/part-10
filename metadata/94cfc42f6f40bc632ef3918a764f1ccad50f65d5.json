The ordeal of these men - who found themselves tested by barbarism, murder, starvation, death, dehydration, and hostile tribes that roamed the desert on camelback - is made indelibly vivid in this gripping account of courage, brotherhood, and survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94cfc42f6f40bc632ef3918a764f1ccad50f65d5","amp;dn":"Dean+King+-+Skeletons+On+The+Zahara","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94cfc42f6f40bc632ef3918a764f1ccad50f65d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,207,196,47,111,64,188,99,46,243,145,138,118,79,28,202,213,15,101,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
