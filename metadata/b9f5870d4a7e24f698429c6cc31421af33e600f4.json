They found underground credibility as an acid house act and pioneers of rock/dance crossover, before moving on to international commercial success with &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot; and the Boss Drum album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f5870d4a7e24f698429c6cc31421af33e600f4","amp;dn":"Shamen+Discography+1987-1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f5870d4a7e24f698429c6cc31421af33e600f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,245,135,13,74,126,36,246,152,66,156,108,195,20,33,175,51,230,0,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
