But what if there were a way to consciously tap this intuitive power and make it a regular part of diagnosis and treatment?\n\nFor more than 20 years, Dr. Judith Orloff has pioneered the use of intuition in healthcare. With Becoming an Intuitive Healer, she now presents a full-length audio workshop about the indispensable role of intuition in healing.\n\nGoing Beyond the Limits of Linear Thought\n\nThe use of intuition in healing is rooted in the universal ability to receive and process information in both linear and nonlinear ways, begins Dr. Orloff. The linear, or analytic, mind plays an essential role in understanding the didactic knowledge and training specific to the healthcare profession. However, there is an infinite amount of wisdom that we cannot access through logic alone. Instead, we must learn to rely on our nonlinear, or intuitive, mind to create a complete picture of the person we're trying to help.\n\nBecoming an Intuitive Healer provides you with detailed instruction in every phase of intuitive healing, including how to make a diagnosis, the basics of energy healing, protecting yourself from burnout, working with subtle energy and intuitive empathy, and much more.\n\nThe New Wave of Healthcare\n\nThe days of going to the doctor to find out what's wrong and how to fix it are thankfully coming to a close, explains Dr. Orloff. Today, an ever-increasing number of healthcare practitioners recognize the vital need for an &quot;us&quot; in the therapeutic relationship.\n\nRecorded at an in-depth four-day training, Becoming an Intuitive Healer gives you all the skills and insights required to use your intuition in conjunction with conventional knowledge. The result: a wholly balanced practice that considers the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects central to your patients' total well-being.\n\n1 Session 1: Transforming Healthcare through Intuitive Healing 1:11:07\n2 Session 2: Intuitive Diagnosis, Phase I (part 1) 47:59\n3 Session 2: Intuitive Diagnosis, Phase I (part 2) 1:05\n4 Session 2: Intuitive Diagnosis, Phase I (part 3) 16:29\n5 Session 3: Accessing Intuition through Dreams 54:37\n6 Session 4: Healing with Subtle Energy and Intuitive Empathy 1:04:00\n7 Session 5: The Basics of Energy Healing (part 1) 13:34\n8 Session 5: The Basics of Energy Healing (part 2) 27:54\n9 Session 5: The Basics of Energy Healing (part 3) 22:59\n10 Session 6: Shifting the Balance in Traditional Healthcare 1:11:32\n\nMP3 - 64 kbps - CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c47257bbef5bbec17909c64b9f3683635fc9c66","amp;dn":"Judith+Orloff+-+Becoming+an+Intuitive+Healer+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c47257bbef5bbec17909c64b9f3683635fc9c66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,71,37,123,190,245,187,236,23,144,156,100,185,243,104,54,53,252,156,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
