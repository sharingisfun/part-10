Bryant, at the time thought of as a young modern traditionalist, has always felt perfectly at home playing the blues. He performs five original and diverse blues on this set along with &quot;Lover Man&quot; and &quot;Rockin' Chair,&quot; showing that he really never needed a bassist or a drummer to sound like a complete band. This Prestige album was reissued in the Original Jazz Classics but thus far only as an LP; highly recommended in any case. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Blues #3\n02 - Joy (Blues #2)\n03 - Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be)\n04 - Me And The Blues (Blues #1)\n05 - My Blues (Blues #5)\n06 - Rockin' Chair\n07 - Stocking Feet\n\nEnjoy and share!
