The remaining twenty percent, however, are socially maladjusted psychopaths. Waiter Rant offers the server's unique point of view, replete with tales of customer stupidity, arrogant misbehavior, and unseen bits of human grace transpiring in the most unlikely places. Through outrageous stories, The Waiter reveals the secrets to getting good service, proper tipping etiquette, and how to keep him from spitting in your food. The Waiter also shares his ongoing struggle, at age thirty-eight, to figure out if he can finally leave the first job at which he's truly thrived.\n________________________________________\n\nFrom Wiki:\nStarted in April 2004, Waiter Rant is a widely read weblog written by Steve Dublanica. In roughly bi-weekly installments, Dublanica wrote vignettes about the lives of wait staff and customers. Dublanica originally wrote the blog anonymously as &quot;The Waiter.&quot; DublanicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writing style, shtick, and ability to give the reader something they need have caused this blog to become wildly popular in the United States as well as parts of Europe, Asia, and Australia.[citation needed] On July 29, 2008, the book Thanks for the Tip ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Confessions of a Cynical Waiter, based on the blog, was published. The accompanying PR, including TV appearances, meant that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe WaiterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ had to give up his anonymity. The book spent five weeks on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list in 2008.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nAnonymity is tough to maintain when you want to do a book tour. Such is the case with Steve Dublanica, a seminary dropout and laid-off psychiatric worker who, in 2004, started www.WaiterRant.net, blogging as The Waiter. His brutal observations on waiting tables at an upscale restaurant he called The Bistro (outed as Lanterna Tuscan Bistro in Nyack, N.Y.) are expanded in this entertaining audio. Dan John Miller is pitch perfect not only as the WaiterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who devolves from woebegone rookie into jaded veteranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but also as his customers, co-workers, bosses and brother. Miller's vocal interpretation dovetails seamlessly with the material. He shines when the Waiter is dishing it out, but even more so when he's taking it. Miller's performance is enthralling during passages in which he reveals his crippling self-doubt, overwhelming sense of underachievement and acknowledgment that he's become somewhat of a jerk.\n\nFrom Booklist\nThis anonymous work renders in book format a popular blog produced by a veteran waiter toiling in metropolitan New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s high-pressure restaurants. Typical of bloggersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ output, this is a highly idiosyncratic, little-edited, narrowly conceived work; nevertheless, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s readable, fun, and, for those unfamiliar with the sphere of personal service, highly instructive. Unlike the suave servers of EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest restaurants, American waiters rarely find a lifelong career path and present meals only on the way to some other unrelated profession. Customers can reflect human behaviorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extremes, and waiters confront both rudeness and parsimony. In these pages, waiters frequently engage in mutually destructive behaviors with chefs and abuse one another on a personal level. And waitersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ near-total reliance on voluntary tipping can quickly corrupt both the tipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s giver and its receiver. This tell-all is likely to spawn notoriety for the people who run the front of the house just as Anthony BourdainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journals did for kitchen staff.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d9ff9bbf559ea985c57de15e39925801bc95613","amp;dn":"WAITER+RANT-+by+Steve+Dublanica.+Read+Dan+John+Miller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d9ff9bbf559ea985c57de15e39925801bc95613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,159,249,187,245,89,234,152,92,87,222,21,227,153,37,128,27,201,86,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
