The World Moves On\n8. The End Of The World Is Bigger Than Love\n9. I Know What Love Isn't\n10. Every Little Hair Knows Your Name \n\n\nThe album came out of a break up which isn't a new story. He fell in love and it didn't work out. It borrows sparingly from the vast and colorful palette of sounds he created on Kortedala. I Know What Love Isn't has strings but not a string section, an upright piano not grand, a single saxophone, gracenotes from a flute, a lot of tambourine. Combined in exact proportions with Lekman's melancholy abstract lyrics, the songs evoke the classic sound of the Brill Building in it's heyday. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b4ade7ac64fade2badfa921764129c4505bed8","amp;dn":"Jens+Lekman+-+I+Know+What+Love+Isnt+%5Bmp3-320-2012%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b4ade7ac64fade2badfa921764129c4505bed8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,180,173,231,172,100,250,222,43,173,250,146,23,100,18,156,69,5,190,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
