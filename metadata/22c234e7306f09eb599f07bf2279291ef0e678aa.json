Wells was sizzling and aggressive as lead vocalist, Guy's solos were controlled and disciplined, yet strikingly effective in uptempo and ballad situations, while saxophonist A.C. Reed provided soulful and shattering fills and solos behind the vocalists and during the interludes. \nThey were helped by assorted rock luminaries from Eric Clapton, J. Geils and Magic Dick to Dr. John. \nThis deserves a place among the other tremendous items in the Rhino/Atlantic R&amp;B Masters series. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\n01. A Man Of Many Words    [4:02]\n02.
