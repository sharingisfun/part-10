Not because she lacks the genuine weirdness and fearless invention of Micachu (although she does), or the songwriting ability of Florence Welch (although she does). No. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strange because she appears to have based her entire singing style on the odd rhythms and insane lurches of SparksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ This Town AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Big Enough for the Both Of Us.  In small doses Marina can be magnificent. Her first major label single, MowgliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Road, includes insane lyrics about cutlery (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ten silver spoons coming after meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), the beats and pacing of Green DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s HitchinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ a Ride, and Tori Amos-ish baroque soundscapes and wild animal noises. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as much Lord of the Flies as The Jungle Book. Guilty is just as interesting: bursts of harpsichord, beats more at home on a Burial record, looped background vocal motifs and perhaps MarinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best vocal performance on the album. And recent single Hollywood may sound as bombastic and ridiculous as Arnie driving a Humvee through a plate glass window, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superbly enjoyable.  The consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of The Outsider is nothing like anything else here, for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence. On Oh No! she sings, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do love, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do friends / IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m only after success, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need a relationship.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the opener, Are You Satisfied: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not my problem / is my problem / that I never am happy / my problem is my problem on how fast I will succeed.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ambition and talent is useful, but a having a massive ego and being friendless is not. Hopefully sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just singing in character.  Judging by the auspicious critical and commercial reception to Hollywood, there will be many who find a great deal to love about Marina and her whacky voice; but there will be just as many who despise her. A tiny minority may be indifferent, but like Mika, the male act whose songs sound most like those on The Family Jewels, the Abergavenny-born singer will mostly polarise opinion.
