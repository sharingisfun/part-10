It is the most complete, compelling, and accessible series on Cosmos, Consciousness and God ever produced for television.\n\nCloser To Truth explores fundamental issues of universe, brain/mind, religion, meaning and purpose through intimate, candid conversations with leading scientists, philosophers, scholars, theologians and creative thinkers of all kinds. The shows are a rich visual experience, shot entirely on location in high definition with multiple cameras generating rich production values. The visual lushness of the high definition, on-location productions, combined with the intriguing titles of the shows, builds audiences already interested in mankind's greatest questions.\n\nPublic fascination with questions of Cosmos, Consciousness and particularly of God has grown substantially in recent years. Public debate has been intense, often heated. Closer To Truth presents to mass audiences these leading-edge ideas in an approachable, rational and balanced manner, and introduces the human personalities behind these ideas.\n\nCloser To Truth is hosted and executive produced by Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn.\n\nCloser To Truth is Robert's life journey to grasp Cosmos, Consciousness, and God, visiting those who think deeply about existence, meaning and purpose.\n\nAs Robert says, &quot;I do not promise that you will find Ultimate Truth. I do promise that you will be exhilarated... getting Closer To Truth&quot;.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.closertotruth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.closertotruth.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nVersion history:\n\n1.1 (2010-04-08):\n  - Compressed all the videos (losslessly) with WinRAR, saving 35%.\n  - Corrected a typo in the torrent comment:  *15* episodes, not 14.\n1.0 (2009-08-31):\n  - [First public release].\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27879becf994d22ebe0bde0f977cdfd7e5595c11","amp;dn":"Closer+To+Truth+-+Season+3+%5Bv1.1%5D+%5BASF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27879becf994d22ebe0bde0f977cdfd7e5595c11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,135,155,236,249,148,210,46,190,11,222,15,151,124,223,215,229,89,92,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
