Each chapter begins with a clinically relevant veterinary issue and then presents one aspect of basic immunology in the context of that issue. All chapters include learning objectives and a clinical correlation follow-up section that includes student considerations and a review of the possible explanations for the clinical presentation.\n\nIllustrated with 250 full-color images and figures that will also be available as PowerPoint teaching aids, Basic Veterinary Immunology and related materials will be made available online to students, faculty, and clinical veterinarians in partnership with the Veterinary Information Network.\n\nBasic Veterinary Immunology will provide students with a good working knowledge of veterinary immunology that will serve them both in the completion of their curricula and in professional practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ff81d2b4bd4a3b3088f26ab33a3c7660f19f5ee","amp;dn":"Basic+Veterinary+Immunology+%5BPDF%5D%5B2014%5D%7Btahir99%7D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ff81d2b4bd4a3b3088f26ab33a3c7660f19f5ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,248,29,43,75,212,163,179,8,143,38,171,51,163,199,102,15,25,245,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
