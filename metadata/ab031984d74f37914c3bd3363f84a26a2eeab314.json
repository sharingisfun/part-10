This means that some of these have been commercially released in great shape with lots of extras and subtitles, and the 3 of them are not in the best shape and have extras or subtitles.\n\nExcept for the FAMILY GUY spoofs (thanks to the OP!), I have ripped all of these fresh from commercial DVDs to the highest AVI resolution possible, and always to a bit rate of at least .15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Enjoy.\n\n\n\nRoad to ... refers to a series of seven comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. They are also often referred to as the &quot;Road&quot; pictures or the &quot;Road&quot; series. The movies were a combination of adventure, comedy, romance, and music. The minimal plot often took a back seat to gags, many of them supposedly ad-libbed by Crosby and Hope during filming.\n\nRumour has it that, during the filming of &quot;...Singapore&quot;, Dotty Lamour said to the camera, &quot;Hey fellas, I haven't had a line for ages!&quot; From that time on, the scene was set for what was one of the most enduring franchises in the history of motion pictures.\n\nEach film is not simply a comedic film, but a satire of some of the popular film genres of the day, including jungle, Arabian nights, Alaskan adventure, and high seas. The final film not only comes much later, but involves a newer genre; Hong Kong spoofs the spy films of the sixties.\n\nIn 1977, an eighth Road to ... movie was planned titled Road to the Fountain of Youth; however, Crosby died that year of a heart attack.\n\nIn 1947 Astor Pictures released a compilation film of several of Crosby's Educational Pictures short subjects called The Road to Hollywood to evoke the series.\n\nFilms in the series\n\nRoad to Singapore (1940)\nRoad to Zanzibar (1941)\nRoad to Morocco (1942)\nRoad to Utopia (1946)\nRoad to Rio (1947)\nRoad to Bali (1952)\nRoad to Hong Kong (1962)\n\nEXTRAS\n\nBob Hope - America's Entertainer (History Channel Biography)\n\nBob Hope - The Road to Laughter\n\nAll six (current to 11-27-2011) FAMILY GUY &quot;Road To...&quot; Spoofs\n\n\nNote ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ For the younger folks out there who may not know, Bob Hope was famous for his trips overseas during wartime to entertain American Troops for the USO. Compilations of these were shown on American television each Christmas during the Vietnam war.
