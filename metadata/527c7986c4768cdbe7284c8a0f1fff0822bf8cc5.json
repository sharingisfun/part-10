Not only that, but your application will also run on all major operating systems, and it will look like it's written for that operating system!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:527c7986c4768cdbe7284c8a0f1fff0822bf8cc5","amp;dn":"%5BPluralsight%5D+Python+Desktop+Application+Development+Video+Tutor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"527c7986c4768cdbe7284c8a0f1fff0822bf8cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,124,121,134,196,118,140,219,231,40,76,138,15,31,255,8,34,191,140,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
