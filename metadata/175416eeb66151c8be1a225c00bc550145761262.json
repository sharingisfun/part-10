Diversion's audio engine may consume lots of CPU power. It is highly recommended to run Diversion on Intel Core i5 or i7 processors. Please make sure you have the following system specifications:\n\nMac OS X 10.6.8 (or later)\n\nAudio Unit and VST.\n\nDiversion is a versatile, high quality software synthesizer, designed for use in any genre of professional electronic music production. Diversion takes the full advantage of modern processors to bring you the perfect sound quality that fits standards of hardware synthesizers.\n\nDiversion offers 4 oscillators with a wide range of different waveforms with a near to zero level of aliasing. The oscillators generate sounds in real-time by using our algorithms, which don't degrade the sound quality at high frequencies. All waveforms have two independent parameters X and Y allowing you to adjust the timbre of the produced sound. The oscillators also feature such synthesis techniques as FM, RM, wave shaping and filtering.\n\nSince version 1.2 Diversion offers comprehensive Wavetable Editor, which allows to load arbitrary single cycle WAV files. With new Wavetable Editor it is possible to edit waveforms both in time and frequency space as well as apply different effects. Since version 1.3, Diversion provides sample playback with granular synthesis and output audio recording.\n\n\nfuture-dada  MMXIV.
