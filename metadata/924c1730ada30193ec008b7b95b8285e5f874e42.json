Inevitably, this meant he walked the thin line between sophisticated pop and adult contemporary, but he did it with grace from 1985's Dream of the Blue Turtles to 1993's Ten Summoner's Tales. Unfortunately, Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting doesn't illustrate what a deft trick he pulled off with that quartet of albums. Naturally, Fields of Gold concentrates on his hit singles, just like any other greatest-hits collection, but Sting's material sounds surprisingly tame in this context. Sure, there is a number of great songs here -- enough to state his case as a fine songwriter or to satisfy his casual fans. Still, these songs are safe choices and all share a similarly tranquil quality, which means the collection itself becomes a little monotonous. Nevertheless, Fields of Gold performs the necessary service of rounding up all of the big hits -- &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free,&quot; &quot;All This Time,&quot; &quot;Fortress Around Your Heart,&quot; &quot;They Dance Alone,&quot; &quot;If Ever Lose My Faith in You,&quot; &quot;Fragile,&quot; and an alternate version of &quot;We'll Be Together&quot; -- and offering them on one disc, which is reason enough to make it worthwhile, even with its flaws.\n\n\n\n1 When We Dance \n2 If You Love Somebody Set Them Free \t\n3 Fields of Gold \t\n4 All This Time \t\n5 Englishman in New York \t\n6 Mad About You \t\n7 It's Probably Me \t\n8 They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo) \t\n9 If I Ever Lose My Faith in You \t\n10 Fragile \t\n11 We'll Be Together\t\n12 Moon Over Bourbon Street \t\n13 Love Is the Seventh Wave \t\n14 Russians \t\n15 Why Should I Cry for You? \t\n16 \tThis Cowboy Song \n17 \tFragilidad\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 175 MiB\nDuration                                 : 01h 16mn 50s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting 1984-1994 [Argentina Bonus Tracks]\nAlbum/Performer                          : Sting\nPerformer                                : Sting\nComposer                                 : Sting\nPublisher                                : PolyGram\nGenre                                    : Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1994\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 01h 16mn 50s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel count                            : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n\n***FRONT COVER***\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tcnskAbl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tcnskAbl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***BACK COVER***\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ajz9cYfl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ajz9cYfl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:924c1730ada30193ec008b7b95b8285e5f874e42","amp;dn":"Sting.1994.FIELDS+OF+GOLD-THE+BEST+OF+STING+1984-1994.%28Argentina","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"924c1730ada30193ec008b7b95b8285e5f874e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,76,23,48,173,163,1,147,236,0,139,123,149,184,40,94,95,135,78,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
