On his third album Strong Feelings, Paisley seeks refuge in the beauty of the romantic lyrical metaphors that have populated the genre since at least the heyday of Hank Williams. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ice it breaks the midday sun / in springtime when the river runs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he sings in Ã¢â‚¬Å“My LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most bracingly pretty numbers. Essentially, Paisley is saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nature tends to stay in motion, so no matter how hard or deeply you love something itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to leave you eventually.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But it sounds so much sweeter the way he says it.    \n\nMortality is PaisleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s central theme; every life is overshadowed by the omnipresence of death, every romantic relationship dimmed by the inevitability of eventual separation. This is the subject matter of a zillion country songs, of course, but unlike that other, more famous country singer named Paisley (whose song Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is Country MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ extols the virtues of songwriting limned with the tangible directness of everyday language), Doug Paisley hears a song on the radio and feels suddenly lifted toward transcendence. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I turned the radio on 25 years ago/ And they were playing your song/ I looked for you on the town, thought I was tracking you down/ But you were there all along,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he croons on the gently chugging Ã¢â‚¬Å“Radio GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s either addressing an actual woman or equating what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just heard grace the airwaves with a long-lost love. In Doug PaisleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs, distinguishing between whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s felt scarcely matters.\n\nAfter a dues-paying tenure as a classic country covers act and the release of his understated self-titled 2008 debut, Paisley broke through in 2010 with his sophomore effort, Constant Companion, which was helped along by high-profile co-stars like Leslie Feist and the BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Garth Hudson. For Feelings, Paisley retains producer Stew Crookes and Hudson, who contributes crisp and cozy organ lines to five of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 10 tracks that are so warm you want to rub your hands over them. (His playing on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Song My Love Can SingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is by itself the worth the price of admission.) Subbing in for Feist on harmony vocals is legendary Canadian singer-songwriter Mary Margaret OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hara, who adds another layer of winsome melancholy to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not Too Late (To Say Goodbye)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main musical ingredientsÃ¢â‚¬â€finger-picked guitar, lightly brushed drums, relaxed though subtly emotive vocalsÃ¢â‚¬â€knowingly recall the quietest, most pained cuts on 70s outlaw country records and the twangiest numbers on that eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rock-leaning singer-songwriter LPs. \n\nMusically, Strong Feelings reiterates Constant Companion, which is fine, because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good formula and PaisleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are stronger this time. (He even musters up something resembling swagger on the steadily rocking Ã¢â‚¬Å“To and FroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.) ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sound that comes wrapped in a warm glow of nostalgia thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s undercut by lyrics revealing the slow poison of lingering too long on your memories. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I turned the ground and found the roots still burning/ A night moon that lingers in a blue sky brings a yearning/ If it takes a waterfall to drown all my doubts/ Sometimes it takes a lie to let me know what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Paisley says in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old TimesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Sometimes a song on the radio can feel like self-delusion in the cold, hard light of experience. No matter the short-term pleasure it provides, life marches inexorably toward an uncertain destination. But Paisley seems content to turn it up anyway and let the music carry him away to a better place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:622b38917e7efa5f23177906f34e8483ea53a729","amp;dn":"Doug+Paisley+-+Strong+Feelings+%282014%29+320K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"622b38917e7efa5f23177906f34e8483ea53a729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,43,56,145,126,126,250,95,35,23,121,6,243,78,132,131,234,83,167,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
