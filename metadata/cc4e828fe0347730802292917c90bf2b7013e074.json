Completed in 1917, Ripening shows Suk at the height of his powers. Those new to this piece will be surprised at its neglect; its skill, subtlety and sophisticated craftsmanship are matched by an intensity of lyrical expression that has few rivals in the twentieth century.'' In the meantime let me salute both Pesek's thrillingly lucid, imaginative direction (at times Neumann sounds positively deadpan by comparison) as well as some superbly accomplished, communicative playing from the RLPO. The engineering, too, is absolutely first-class, and overall this is as supremely convincing a realization of this ambitious, enormously rewarding score as we are likely to get for some considerable time to come.\r\nThe coupling, Praga, is an affectionate, enjoyably grandiloquent portrait-in-sound of that fair city dating from 1904. What else can I say? More Suk from this partnership, please!&quot; --Andrew Achenbach\r\n\r\nJOSEF SUK (1874-1935)\r\n[1-8] Ripening, op. 34, symphonic poem\r\n[9] Praga, op. 26, symphonic poem\r\nTT 66:53\r\n\r\nRoyal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra\r\nLibor PeÅ¡ek\r\n\r\nRecording: Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool, August 1992\r\nProducer: John West\r\nBalance engineer:Mike Clements\r\nÂ® 1993 Original sound recordings made by Virgin Classics Limited\r\nÂ© 1993 Virgin Classics Limited\r\nVC 7 59318 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4e828fe0347730802292917c90bf2b7013e074","amp;dn":"Josef+Suk%3A+Ripening%2C+Praga+-+RLPO%2C+Libor+Pesek+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc4e828fe0347730802292917c90bf2b7013e074","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,78,130,143,224,52,119,48,128,34,146,145,124,144,191,43,112,19,224,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
