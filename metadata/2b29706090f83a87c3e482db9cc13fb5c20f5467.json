B. King mixed elements of blues and pop/rock. Producer Bill Szymczyk decided to follow up on the success of the hit &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; by matching King with a musical all-star cast. The result was one of King's most critically acclaimed albums and one of the most highly regarded blues crossover albums of all time.\nThe album appeared on several of Billboard's album charts in 1970, reaching number 26 on the Pop album chart, number seven on the Jazz album chart and eight on Billboard's listing for &quot;Black Albums.&quot; The album also generated several hit singles, &quot;Chains and Things&quot;, King's own &quot;Ask Me No Questions&quot; and Leon Russell's &quot;Hummingbird&quot;.\nKing himself, also, views the album as one of his greatest achievements. When asked about his best work, King has said, &quot;I know the critics always mention Live &amp; Well or Live at the Regal, but I think that Indianola Mississippi Seeds was the best album that I've done artistically.&quot; [/color][/quote]\n\n[img]http://www.guitarmasterclass.net/wiki/images/5/58/King1.jpg[/img]\n\n[size=4][color=red][b]Tracklist &amp; Artistes[/b][/color]\n1.&quot;Nobody Loves Me But My Mother&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 1:26 \n[color=lime]B.
