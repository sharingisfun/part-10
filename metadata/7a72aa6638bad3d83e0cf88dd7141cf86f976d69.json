My name is Casey Kasem, and the countdown continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nAs an extra, Casey plays the number one song of five years earlier. It's singer was a man whose last name was Presley, but his first name wasn't Elvis, and he lived in a cave for a short time.\n\nCasey reads a letter that says, &quot;I was wondering if there has ever been a song that was number one, then dropped out of the number one spot, and then came back to that position?&quot; Casey says it has happened about ten times in the prior 15 years, and then tells how one song regained the top spot TWICE!\n\nThe highest debut of the week comes in at such a high position, you don't hear it till the second hour. It is a spoken word recording made by a DJ while he substituted at a Los Angeles radio station. So many people called in wanting to buy a copy that Motown picked it up and released it only a few weeks before this broadcast. \n\nThere is a hit by a super star who has had eight chart records so far in 1971, and 69 in his career. His song is about Daisy Duke's (if you remember Daisy Duke's), but he calls them what they were called before there was a Daisy Duke to name them after.\n\nThere is a song called &quot;Chicago&quot; (by Graham Nash at number 35) and another one by Chicago (&quot;Beginnings&quot; at number 19).\n\nFinally, Carole King is the hero of this countdown. She wrote &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot; (at number 32 by Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway, and also at number 3 by James Taylor, and then can be found at number 2 singing another one of her hits, &quot;It's Too Late.&quot;\n\n40: Love Means You Never Have To Say You're Sorry - The Sounds Of Sunshine\n39: Riders On The Storm - The Doors\n38: Want Ads - The Honeycomb\n37: Sweet Hitch-Hiker - Creedence Clearwater Revival\n36: If Not For You - Olivia Newton-John\n35: Chicago - Graham Nash\n34: Summer Sand - Dawn\n33: Moon Shadow - Cat Stevens\n32: You've Got A Friend - Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway\n31: Liar - Three Dog Night\n30: High Time We Went - Joe Cocker\nSPECIAL: Wild Thing - The Troggs\n29: Rings - Cimarron\nSPECIAL: Misty - Johnny Mathis\n28: Wild Horses - The Rolling Stones\n27: Funky Nassau - Beginning Of The End\n26: What The World Needs Now - Tom Clay\n25: Get It On - Chase\n24: Love The One You're With - The Isley Brothers\n23: Double Barrel - Dave &amp; Ancil Collins\n22: When You're Hot, You're Hot - Jerry Reed\n21: Signs - The Five Man Electrical Band\n20: Hot Pants (Part #1) - James Brown\n19: Beginnings - Chicago\n18: Bring The Boys Home - Freda Payne\n17: I Don't Wanna Do Wrong - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n16: Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again - The Fortunes\n15: Mercy Mercy Me - Marvin Gaye\n14: She's Not Just Another Woman - The Eighth Day\n13: Never Ending Song Of Love - Delaney &amp; Bonnie\n12: That's The Way I Always Heard It Should Be - Carly Simon\n11: Rainy Days And Mondays - The  Carpenters\n10: Sooner Or Later - The Grass Roots\n9: Take Me Home, Country Roads - John Denver\n8: How Can You Mend A Broken Heart - The Bee Gees\n7: Draggin' The Line - Tommy James\n6: Treat Her Like A Lady - Cornelius Brothers &amp; Sister Rose\n5: Mr. Big Stuff - Jean Knight\n4: Don't Pull Your Love - Hamilton Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds\n3: You've Got A Friend - James Taylor\n2: It's Too Late - Carole King\n1: Indian Reservation - The Raiders\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a72aa6638bad3d83e0cf88dd7141cf86f976d69","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1971_July_24th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a72aa6638bad3d83e0cf88dd7141cf86f976d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,114,170,102,56,186,211,216,62,12,248,141,215,20,28,248,111,151,109,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
