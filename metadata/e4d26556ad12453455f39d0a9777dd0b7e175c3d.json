His three-book series on Power Electronics focuses on three essential topics in the power sequence based on applications relevant to this age of sustainable energy such as wind turbines and hybrid electric vehicles. The three topics include power electronics, power systems and electric machines.\n\nKey features in the first Edition build on Mohan's successful MNPERE texts; his systems approach which puts dry technical detail in the context of applications; and substantial pedagogical support including PPT's, video clips, animations, clicker questions and a lab manual. It follows a top-down systems-level approach to power electronics to highlight interrelationships between these sub-fields. It's intended to cover fundamental and practical design. This book also follows a building-block approach to power electronics that allows an in-depth discussion of several important topics that are usually left. Topics are carefully sequenced to maintain continuity and interest.\n\n\nHardcover: 288 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (October 18, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118074807\nISBN-13: 978-1118074800","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4d26556ad12453455f39d0a9777dd0b7e175c3d","amp;dn":"Power+Electronics+-+A+First+Course+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4d26556ad12453455f39d0a9777dd0b7e175c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,210,101,86,173,18,69,52,85,243,157,10,151,119,221,11,126,23,92,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
