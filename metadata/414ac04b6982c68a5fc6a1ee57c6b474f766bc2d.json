In this \n\nmagisterial and acclaimed history, Anne Applebaum offers the first fully documented \n\nportrait of the Gulag, from its origins in the Russian Revolution, through its \n\nexpansion under Stalin, to its collapse in the era of glasnost. Applebaum intimately \n\nre-creates what life was like in the camps and links them to the larger history of \n\nthe Soviet Union. Immediately recognized as a landmark and long-overdue work of \n\nscholarship, Gulag is an essential book for anyone who wishes to understand the \n\nhistory of the twentieth century.\n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:414ac04b6982c68a5fc6a1ee57c6b474f766bc2d","amp;dn":"%5BPULITZER%5D+Anne+Applebaum+-+Gulag+-+A+History+%5BEPUB%5D+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"414ac04b6982c68a5fc6a1ee57c6b474f766bc2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,74,192,75,105,130,198,138,95,198,161,238,87,198,180,116,247,102,188,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
