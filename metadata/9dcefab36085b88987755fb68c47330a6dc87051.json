Back on the passionate grind, vocalist/guitarist Lucas Silveira and his crew, have once again successfully subjected their listeners to songs of woe and wisdom, a hard rocking, thinking manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s version of Elvis Costello with the lyrical prowess of Chrissy Hynde , the combination makes this group of Canadians worthy of  taking the center stage with The Cult, Cyndi Lauper  (True Colors tour) and currently with the legendary New York Dolls to name a few.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHauntedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ opens the album with with exactly that: a haunting, brooding,  almost somber look inside what could be a personal message from the mind and soul of Mr. Silveira, but the title track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDirty KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ takes the album by storm with itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surf-riff, garage rock inspired hooks. There seems to be quite a few ballads on this album, all worthy mind you, just could use a pinch of more Fuzztone/Rock to make this a tasty recipe.  LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s say itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a decaffeinated version of the first Yeah, Yeah, YeahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s album. But pay no mind, its the true songwriting skills that shine. One could even hear some slight nods to Lone Justice from the Shelter album- a classic. Standout tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCareer SuicideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWolverinesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ could easily be the new live faves for The CliksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ already growing international fanbase\n\nProducer Sylvia Massy known for her work with Red Hot Chili Peppers has once again taken her place behind the boards, and turned out a meticulously crafted sound that complements the bandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hard rock stigma that is Dirty King. With the band touring constantly, Lucas Silveira and his bandmates Morgan Doctor and Jen Benton have gone the extra mile to place Canadian Rock back on the mapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ for good.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dcefab36085b88987755fb68c47330a6dc87051","amp;dn":"The+Cliks-Dirty+King-2009-CMG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dcefab36085b88987755fb68c47330a6dc87051","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,206,250,179,96,133,184,137,135,117,95,182,140,71,51,10,109,200,112,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
