A huge departure from the ear-shattering noise of his\nprevious band, Dev&amp;#039;s new material is heavily influenced by the laidback\nsurroundings of the Nebraska studio where it was recorded. Produced by Saddle\nCreek Records&amp;#039; resident knob-twiddler Mike Mogis, Dev&amp;#039;s debut solo album Falling\nOff The Lavender Bridge promises to be an earthy, acoustic adventure.\n\n&quot;I was living in this weird house in the middle of Omaha,&quot; explains Dev. &quot;It was\ngreat. I love the Midwest. I feel so at ease and the atmosphere is so relaxed,\nwhich is exactly what I wanted for this record.&quot; Lead single &amp;#039;Galaxy of the\nLost&amp;#039; encapsulates that feeling beautifully. Beach Boys harmonies and chiming\ncountry-rock guitars provide the perfect backdrop for Dev&amp;#039;s quintessentially\nindie-ish vocals.\n\n&quot;I wrote a lot of the songs about two years ago, or within that time,&quot; Dev\ncontinues. &quot;The last one on the album I wrote whilst in Omaha but I demoed\naround fifty songs originally and then it got whittled down to these eleven?\nShit, I don&amp;#039;t even know. I think it&amp;#039;s ten actually.&quot; Clearly a prolific\nsongwriter, Dev Hynes will happily turn his talents to most genres. Lightspeed\nChampion is simply the outlet for his more pastoral work and not a complete\nturnaround. &quot;Lately I&amp;#039;ve wrote a group of quite rock-based songs and some\nhip-hop/R&amp;B songs,&quot; he reveals. &quot;Buy yeah, for this albums these songs seemed to\nfit together, so that&amp;#039;s what I recorded.&quot;\n\nTaking its name from Dev&amp;#039;s childhood attempts at dream control, the eagerly\nanticipated Falling Off The Lavender Bridge LP looks set to become a classic,\ncoming as it does from one of our most intriguing contemporary artists. &quot;I used\nto be able to send myself into the same dream every night if I concentrated hard\nenough,&quot; Dev explains. &quot;I had a lavender frog which my mother gave me and I&amp;#039;d\nhug it until I fell asleep.&quot;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962f67653b367690d6cdaff7bf06c46f142f9a99","amp;dn":"Lightspeed_Champion-Falling_Of_The_Lavender_Bridge-%28Advance%29-200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962f67653b367690d6cdaff7bf06c46f142f9a99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,47,103,101,59,54,118,144,214,205,175,247,191,6,196,111,20,47,154,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
