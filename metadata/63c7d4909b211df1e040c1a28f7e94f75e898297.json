As many by now know Major Winters passed away on January 2, 2011. Major Winters' feelings regarding war and personal glorification are perhaps an enigma in our day and time but they shouldn't be. If you know a WWII veteran take time out to shake his or her hand and say &quot;thank you&quot; while these great people still walk among us.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn war, great commanders lead soldiers into hell to do the impossible.\n\nThey were called Easy CompanyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but their mission was never easy. Immortalized as the Band of Brothers, they suffered 150 percent casualties while liberating Europe, an unparalleled record of bravery under fire. Dick Winters was their commander, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe best combat leader in World War IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to his men. This is his story, told in his own words for the first time.\n\nOn D-Day, Dick Winters parachuted into France and assumed leadership of the Band of Brothers when their commander was killed. He led them through the Battle of the Bulge, the attack on FoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½where Easy Company reached its breaking pointÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and into Germany, by which time each member had been wounded.\n\nNeither a protest against war nor a glamorization of combat, this is a moving tribute to the human spirit by a man who earned the love and respect of the men of Easy Company and the adulation of new generations worldwide.\n\n\n\nThis is a retail copy so formatting is high quality. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63c7d4909b211df1e040c1a28f7e94f75e898297","amp;dn":"Beyond+Band+of+Brothers+-+Major+Dick+Winters+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63c7d4909b211df1e040c1a28f7e94f75e898297","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,199,212,144,155,33,29,241,224,64,193,162,143,126,148,247,94,137,130,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
