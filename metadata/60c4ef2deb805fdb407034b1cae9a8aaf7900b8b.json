Citizens are turning into flesh-eating zombies and swarming the streets, while only a few desperate survivors remain. Totaling eight characters in all, each survivor has different and unique abilities that they must use to escape the city before the government annihilates it with a deadly hydrogen bomb. Brand new scenarios, improved computer AI, additional character powers, and faster load times are but a few of the game's new additions since the previous version. Developed exclusively for the PlayStation 2.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
