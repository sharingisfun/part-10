Based on twelve years of research on the theme of jealousy in romantic relationships, Dr. Pines offers real-life vignettes and astute practical advice aimed at helping readers assess their own jealousy quotient as well as offering ways to control their own jealous urges. She asks the most central of questions: What causes jealousy? Are women more prone to jealousy than men? What is the difference between normal and abnormal jealousy? How can you tell if you are a jealous person? To answer these questions, Dr. Pines examines five basic psychological approaches to understanding and treating jealousy - covering such issues as whether jealousy is innate, the result of unresolved childhood traumas, the result of the dynamics within a specific relationship as well as other psychological explanations. This book is essential reading for anyone seeking a better understanding of the dynamics of jealousy - its causes, danger signs, and symptoms - and the most effective strategies available for keeping jealousy controlled.
