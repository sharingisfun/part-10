Some of you are just leeching...do you job too. Get the word out on these FREE downloads. We did our job of slaving over these remixxxes, so you help get the word out to your cult. Fair enough?\n\nSo, remember: 1. like my Alien Jourgensen and Ministry fan pages on Facebook AND hit up my Twitter @alfknjourgensen. 2. Send a link back to us from your website, social media or online magazines.\n\nHow easy was that...a new track gets released THIS Monday (along with some extras on the Pirate Bay... yes...THAT Pirate Bay) and will be released in the same order as on the album.
