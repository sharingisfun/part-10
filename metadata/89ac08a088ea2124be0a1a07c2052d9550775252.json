Paul McGann no-showed, and everybody else is tiptoeing around how bad the TV movie was. They deserve a little slack since they only have 90 minutes of material to talk about, instead of years of amazing performances, BUT they probably should've mentioned the hundreds of other media adventures of Doctor numero ocho. There are probably (dumb) reasons for why they didn't.\n\nWill Eccleston no-show next? Like many great Doctor Who stories, these cliffhangers are nerve-wracking! Can't wait to see the 9th again.\n\nAnyhoo, go ahead and get it, I won't stop you. I am here to upload Caesar, not to praise him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89ac08a088ea2124be0a1a07c2052d9550775252","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+Revisited+-+the+Eighth+Doctor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89ac08a088ea2124be0a1a07c2052d9550775252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,172,8,160,136,234,33,36,190,10,26,7,194,5,45,149,80,119,82,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
