Use a terminal emulator or Root Explorer to...\n   a. copy the included LIBMOBILESHELL.SO file\n      to the directory /data/data/com.spb.shell3d/lib\n      #cp libmobileshell.so /data/data/com.spb.shell3d/lib\n   b. change the permissions on the file to 755\n      #chmod 755 /data/data/com.spb.shell3d/lib/libmobileshell.so\n\n   If you're using Root Explorer, permissions need to be set to;\n     Owner:  Read/Write/Execute\n     Group:  Read/Execute\n     Others: Read/Execute\n\n4. Press the HOME key. When prompted, select SPB Shell 3D.\n\n5. Once you're happy with wanting to keep SPB Shell 3D as your\n   launcher, tick the &quot;set as default&quot; the next time you press\n   the HOME key, then select SPB Shell 3D.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ea09cc78a399f525e0d107f84df61105c6347a","amp;dn":"SPB+Shell+3D+for+Android%2C+v1.1.1+%2819%2F05%2F11%29+-+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ea09cc78a399f525e0d107f84df61105c6347a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,234,9,204,120,163,153,245,37,224,209,7,248,77,246,17,5,198,52,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
