Mathematical modelling requires deep understanding of classical numerical methods. This essential guide provides the reader with sufficient foundations in these areas to venture into more advanced texts.\n\nThe first section of the book presents numEclipse, an open source tool for numerical computing based on the notion of MATLABÃ‚Â®. numEclipse is implemented as a plug-in for Eclipse, a leading integrated development environment for Java programming. The second section studies the classical methods of numerical analysis. Numerical algorithms and their implementations are presented using numEclipse.
