ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nine songs full of the promise and thrill of 1981-83. But even more than Ronson and Duran Duran have let on, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also an album clearly in debt to the future, a sleek and sexy future where a guy in his early 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdriving up the AutobahnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is still the same superhero who wrestled hot chicks in a Sri Lankan swamp all those years ago. This is the sound of time stood still, of a feeling of reckless and sophisticated abandon launched decades forward without skipping a beat.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e6140ed17b66d8db62aaf26b9e81931250f0fd","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+All+You+Need+Is+Now+%5Bmp3-320-2010%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e6140ed17b66d8db62aaf26b9e81931250f0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,230,20,14,209,123,102,216,219,98,170,242,107,158,129,147,18,80,240,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
