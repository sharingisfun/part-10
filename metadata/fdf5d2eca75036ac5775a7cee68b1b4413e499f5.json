The album aimed for more of a heavy metal sound than the previous ones but still managed to produce a major power ballad hit, &quot;Is This Love&quot;. The album was a major crossover hit eventually selling over eight million copies in the US (and thus going eight times platinum).\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;Crying in the Rain '87&quot;   \t5:37\n2. \t&quot;Bad Boys&quot;   \t  \t        4:09\n3. \t&quot;Still of the Night&quot;   \t  \t6:38\n4. \t&quot;Here I Go Again '87&quot;    \t4:33\n5. \t&quot;Give Me All Your Love&quot;     \t3:30\n6. \t&quot;Is This Love&quot;   \t  \t4:43\n7. \t&quot;Children of the Night&quot;\t  \t4:24\n8. \t&quot;Straight for the Heart&quot;     \t3:40\n9. \t&quot;Don't Turn Away&quot;   \t  \t5:11\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf5d2eca75036ac5775a7cee68b1b4413e499f5","amp;dn":"Whitesnake+-+1987+-+Whitesnake+%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf5d2eca75036ac5775a7cee68b1b4413e499f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,245,210,236,167,80,54,172,87,117,167,206,230,139,27,68,19,228,153,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
