Based on the book of the same name, the program is devoted to poignant recitations of letters to and from American participants of the Vietnam war. The letters are heard over images culled from news footage, home movies and still photography, with contemporary music added to put things in the proper historical context. The 2-hour film, featuring readings from various well-known actors (see cast list), was a co-production involving Bill Couturie, a previous Emmy winner for Vietnam Requiem, and the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theatre Company. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nsubtitles: eng, fre, spa, pt-br\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCast\n\n    * Tom Berenger - Co-narrator\n    * Ellen Burstyn - Narrator\n    * J.
