You can set which calls are recorded and which are ignored. Listen to the recording, add notes and share it. Integration with Dropbox allows calls to be saved and synchronized to the cloud as well. \n\nPlease note that call recording does not work on certain handsets and can result in inferior quality recordings. We therefore suggest that you try the free version before purchasing the paid app.\n\nIf you encounter any recording issues, try recording from a different audio source, or use auto-on speaker mode.\n\nRecorded calls are stored in the Inbox. You can change the destination recordings folder to an external SD card as well. You can set the size of the inbox. The number of saved calls is limited only by your device memory. \n\nIf you decide that a conversation is important, save it and it will be stored in the Saved Calls folder. If not, old recordings will automatically be deleted when new calls fill up the inbox.\n\nYou can enable a Call Summary Menu with options to appear immediately after a call.\nSearch for recordings by contact, phone number, or note.\n\nThere are 3 default settings for automatic recording:\n\nRecord everything (default) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This setting records all calls except for contacts pre-selected to be ignored.\n\nIgnore everything Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This setting records no calls except for contacts pre-selected to be recorded.\n\nIgnore contacts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This setting records all calls with people who are not contacts, except for contacts pre-selected to be recorded.\n\nIn the Pro version only: You can set calls from particular contacts to be automatically saved, and they will be saved in the cloud.\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\nSupport for additional languages - You can change languages in the settings\nBug fixes\nIn previous versions:\nShow the call subject in the list of recordings - turn on this feature in the settings\nSearch by subject\nImproved integration with Dropbox\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appstar.callrecorderpro&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appstar.callrecorderpro&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec081ae84a1ecde8b45a2abf47cf76286342e187","amp;dn":"Automatic+Call+Recorder+Pro+3.53","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec081ae84a1ecde8b45a2abf47cf76286342e187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,8,26,232,74,30,205,232,180,90,42,191,71,207,118,40,99,66,225,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
