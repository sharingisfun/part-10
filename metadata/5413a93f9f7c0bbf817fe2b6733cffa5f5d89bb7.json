Ranging from sweet chocolate loaves to manchego and prosciutto stuffed bread, the finished loaves are a delight, and one even earns a handshake from Paul.\n\nIn another Bake Off first, Paul sets baguettes as the technical challenge. A seemingly simple recipe, everyone knows what a baguette looks like... or do they? The pressure of the tent gets to a few of the bakers, and the finished baguettes result in one of Paul's most brutal judgings.\n\nFor their show-stopper, the bakers must make edible 3-D bread sculptures. As one baker says, 'it's doughverload', with another making enough bread to start up his own bakery. Mary and Paul have to work their way through a bicycle, a snake, an array of flowers, a lion and even the Brighton Pavilion, all made of bread. The results are impressive - so much so that one baker renders Paul speechless by making the best bread sculpture he's ever seen.\n\n------------------------------\n\nIncludes subtitles\n\nEnjoy !!! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013pqnm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013pqnm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5413a93f9f7c0bbf817fe2b6733cffa5f5d89bb7","amp;dn":"The.Great.British.Bake.Off-S06E03-Bread--720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5413a93f9f7c0bbf817fe2b6733cffa5f5d89bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,19,169,63,159,124,11,191,129,127,226,182,115,60,255,165,245,216,155,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
