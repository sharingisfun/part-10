When the social worker finds out that Cheli leaves Gaby alone in the house while Cheli is at work, Cheli is compelled to place Gaby in a day program. For the first time in her life, Cheli shares Gaby's care with someone else; her daily routine collapses and the huge void left by Gaby's absence makes room for a man in Cheli's life in the shape of Zohar, who inadvertently creates a chink in the sisters' symbiotic relationship. While Cheli hangs on to Zohar's love for all she's worth, her inability to have a normal, intimate, and emotional relationship with anyone but her sister forces them into a twisted threesome, where boundaries between love, sacrifice, nurturing, and torturing are crossed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage: Hebrew\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fb1db15b6f6b04a81b45e810c88c7a130007cf2","amp;dn":"At+Li+Layla+aka+Next+to+Her+2014+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fb1db15b6f6b04a81b45e810c88c7a130007cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,177,219,21,182,246,176,74,129,180,94,129,12,136,199,161,48,0,124,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
