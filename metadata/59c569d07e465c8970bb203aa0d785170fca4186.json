Autumn Light\n\nRon Sexsmith is in a difficult spot: Despite his well-structured pop songs and praise from the likes of Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney, his music has been confined to critical darling status. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame, because SexsmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music comprises orchestral, Brian Wilson-esque love odes at times, and at others, contemplative, Sea Change-era Beck tunes. His newest album, Forever Endeavour, fuses those elements into an album of tightly-packed pop goodness.\n\nSexsmith is at his best when he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t try to do too much. Songs like the jaunty Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nowhere IsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the slow-rolling Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lost in ThoughtsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are simple country-folk structures that showcase SexsmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old soul vocoal with rising and falling strings and slide guitars. The latter track could easily be a Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s Leonard Cohen cut (whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another strong supporter of Sexsmith), gliding over the ears like a sea breeze.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sneak Out the Back DoorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lets SexsmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words take front and center Ã¢â‚¬â€ just him and his guitar. He tells the story of a relationship falling apart and how heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“never been good at saying good-byeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ so heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just going to Ã¢â‚¬Å“sneak out the back door.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The old sad-words-over-jolly-melody trick works fantasticallyÃ¢â‚¬â€ especially at the end, when he sings, Ã¢â‚¬Å“When my life is over / gonna sneak out the back door / HadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much of a Midas touch / No luck for sure / Give my regards to the people in charge / As I sneak out the back door.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe few missteps on the album are the too-pristine Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back of My HandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the forced Dixieland stomp of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Me Myself and Wine,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The production and extraneous instruments make the songs sound overwrought, particularly the horns on the latter. Overall, though, the album is crisp and straightforward, making Forever Endeavor a big step toward Sexsmith gaining household-name status.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59c569d07e465c8970bb203aa0d785170fca4186","amp;dn":"Ron+Sexsmith+-+Forever+Endeavour+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59c569d07e465c8970bb203aa0d785170fca4186","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,197,105,208,126,70,92,137,112,187,32,58,160,215,133,23,15,202,65,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
