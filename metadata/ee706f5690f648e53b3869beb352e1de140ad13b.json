Making Marriage Simple is the accessible, essential road map to building a strong marriage in the modern world.\nBestselling authors Harville Hendrix and Helen LaKelly Hunt distill into ten essential truths what they've learned about how to create a successful and satisfying relationship-both from their decades of &quot;R&amp;D&quot; in the marriage lab of their workshops, and from their own relationship journey. In each chapter, Harville and Helen introduce a simple truth-such as &quot;a frustration is a wish in disguise,&quot; &quot;incompatibility is grounds for marriage,&quot; or &quot;conflict is growth trying to happen&quot;-and then walk couples through easy yet effective exercises to help them apply each truth in real life, every day.\nHarville and Helen have spent their careers helping couples transform their marriages through research, workshops, and counseling. But marriage-even for marriage experts-is never easy, and a number of years ago they found themselves on the brink of divorce. Harville and Helen put themselves back through the exercises they'd coached so many other couples through, saving their marriage and helping them achieve a true partnership.\nThis book is for all couples. It offers the practical tools needed to transform one's relationship into a rewarding and joyous marriage. Written with humor, compassion, and honesty, and illustrated throughout with engaging line drawings, Making Marriage Simple is a strategic blueprint for creating a stronger, more satisfying partnership in today's world.\n\nPlease Rate and Comment \n\nPlease Seed atleast upto 1:1 Ratio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee706f5690f648e53b3869beb352e1de140ad13b","amp;dn":"Making+Marriage+Simple+Ten+Truths+for+Changing+the+Relationship+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee706f5690f648e53b3869beb352e1de140ad13b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,112,111,86,144,246,72,229,59,56,105,190,179,82,225,222,20,10,209,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
