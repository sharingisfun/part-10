Certainly it is impressive, with its mighty monuments, its three thousand years of history, and its reputation for vast learning and skill. On the other hand, a culture of now deserted monuments,\nof aloof statues, of a flat and static art and of gaping mummies never seems to pulse with good red blood. We feel no kinship to the austere King Khafre in the Cairo Museum or to Queen Hatshepsut masquerading as Osiris in the Metropolitan Museum. The story of ancient Egypt seems more like a fable than like human history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4686db35ae8be29b4394dd6300e54f447fb300e1","amp;dn":"Great+Ages+of+Man+-+Ancient+Egypt+%28History+Arts+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4686db35ae8be29b4394dd6300e54f447fb300e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,134,219,53,174,139,226,155,67,148,221,99,0,229,79,68,127,179,0,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
