In the first section weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put together a 12-week plan to get you into shape, based on the format of a typical fighters training camp. Then, once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in shape, you can tweak your training with moves, routines and tricks from top-level athletes and coaches. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also advice on how to tailor your diet to your new training plan, and how to improve your recovery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is just as vital as training hard. Whether you want to fight or youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re after a fighterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something for you inside.\n\n\n\nMy Blog: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3039478b8a654e551cb1d095706146bc06df2dd0","amp;dn":"Mens+Fitness+-+Build+a+Fighters+Body+-+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3039478b8a654e551cb1d095706146bc06df2dd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,57,71,139,138,101,78,85,28,177,208,149,112,97,70,188,6,223,45,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
