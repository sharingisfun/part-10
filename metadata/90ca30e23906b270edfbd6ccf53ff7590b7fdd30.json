Some are of them were real - some are altered into pure Legend. These legends usually had somebody doing villainous deeds. The even greater thing is that most of these were surrounded in mystery or conspiracy.\r\nMedieval Murder Mysteries uses modern thinking from historical police criminology combined with forensics and human osteologists blended with current historical ideas to try and solve what really happened all those years ago. Magnificent castles, chivalrous knights, powerful kings and queens? You'll have them. Also require dark deeds, illicit lovers, greedy nobles, mad cardinals? Look no further. They're all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  The Princes in the Tower: A Royal Execution \r\nSince he showed up in a Leicestershire car park a short while ago, Richard III has been at his most popular for 500 years - not that he was that popular in the late 15th Century. He is universally blamed for the deaths of the Two Little Princes in the Tower in 1483 - his guilt or innocence is still debated today. We'll gather all the evidence, plus we'll explore the new theory that Richard actually had his own wife killed to smooth his path to the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3155 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1919/medieval-murder-mysteries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90ca30e23906b270edfbd6ccf53ff7590b7fdd30","amp;dn":"Medieval+Murder+Mysteries+Series+1+5of6+The+Princes+in+The+Tower","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90ca30e23906b270edfbd6ccf53ff7590b7fdd30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,202,48,226,57,6,178,112,237,251,214,204,245,63,247,89,11,127,221,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
