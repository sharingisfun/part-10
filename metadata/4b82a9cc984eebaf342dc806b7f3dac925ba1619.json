CONFIDENCE AFRICAINE (1931) manages to address the difficult theme of incest with quiet mastery and seeming effortlessness.\r\n\r\nHe is best known for LES THIBAULT (1922-1940), a monumental eight-part novel cycle published in two volumes in English as THE THIBAULTS (1939) and SUMMER 1914 (1940).  This record of the prosperous Thibault family's development chronicles the social and moral issues confronting the French bourgeoisie from the beginning of the 20th century to the end of World War I.  Reacting against a bourgeois patriarch, the younger son, Jacques, renounces his Roman Catholic past to embrace revolutionary socialism, and the elder son, Antoine, accepts his middle-class heritage but loses faith in its religious foundation.  The outstanding features of the novels are the wide range of human relationships patiently explored, the graphic realism of the sickbed and death scenes, and the dramatic description of European nations being swept into war.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-COLONEL DE MAUMORT (published posthumously in 1983), written over the final eighteen years of his life and still unfinished at the time of his death, sprang from the writer's unflinching examination of the conundrum of our moral ambivalence: why, knowing what is right, do people do wrong?  The result is a work of extraordinary honesty, combining the sweep of his acknowledged master Tolstoy, the penetrating analysis of Proust, and the speculative profundity of Montaigne.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF format (&quot;The Thibaults&quot; also available in ePUB):\r\n\r\n* Confidence Africaine (Marlboro, 1983).
