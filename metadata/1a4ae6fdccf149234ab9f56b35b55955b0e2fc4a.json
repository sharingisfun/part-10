Camille Desmoulins, Danton, Robespierre, St. Juste, Napoleon, the heroes as well as the parties and the masses of the old French revolution, achieved in Roman costumes and with Roman phrases the task of their time: the emancipation and the establishment of modern bourgeois society. One set knocked to pieces the old feud.\nby Karl Marx\n\nEnglish, published in 1852\n\nThis Ebook is not copyrighted and availible under the Public Domain.\n\nFor more in informations please visit http://opencast.de/?p=97\n\nContent seedet by www.opencast.de 1000 Mbit connection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a4ae6fdccf149234ab9f56b35b55955b0e2fc4a","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Karl+Marx+-+Eighteenth+Brumaire+of+Louis+Bonaparte+%28+web","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a4ae6fdccf149234ab9f56b35b55955b0e2fc4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,74,230,253,204,241,73,35,74,185,245,107,53,181,89,85,176,226,252,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
