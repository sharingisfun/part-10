On Somewhere Beyond the Roses, his most recent solo effort and follow up to 2002's Shadows on the Ground&quot;, Kane is at the top of his musical game. The stripped down production and unusual instrumentation (including a bass-less quartet held down by Lambchop's Deanna Varagona), complements Kane's writing to chilling effect. His ability to create mini-movies within his songs - check out &quot;Anybody's Game&quot; - prove that Kane is among only a small handful of writers capable of blending traditional roots music with modern themes to create evocative and relevant folk music for the new millenium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:077665863d5f0425e7e811560fc8c5d9a0cfc5c5","amp;dn":"Kieran+Kane+-+Somewhere+Beyond+The+Roses+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"077665863d5f0425e7e811560fc8c5d9a0cfc5c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,118,101,134,61,95,4,37,231,232,17,86,15,200,197,217,160,207,197,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
