Pepper's&quot; album of '70s soul, helping with its content and its success to open the whole genre to much bigger, richer musical canvases than artists had previously worked with. All of Mayfield's years of experience of life, music, and people were pulled together into a rich, powerful, topical musical statement that reflected not only the most up-to-date soul sounds of its period, finely produced by Mayfield himself, and the immediacy of the times and their political and social concerns, but also embraced the most elegant R&amp;B sounds out of the past. As a producer, Mayfield embraced the most progressive soul sounds of the era, stretching them out compellingly on numbers like &quot;Move on Up,&quot; but also drew on orchestral sounds (especially harps), to achieve some striking musical timbres (check out &quot;Wild and Free&quot;), and wove all of these influences, plus the topical nature of the songs, into a neat, amazingly lean whole. There was only one hit single off of this record, &quot;(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Down Below We're All Going to Go,&quot; which made number three, but the album as a whole was a single entity and really had to be heard that way.\tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRelease date: 1970\nMoFi release: 2010\n\nTracklist:\n01 (Don't Worry) If There's A Hell Below We're All Gonna Go (07:51)\n02 The Other Side Of Town (04:00)\n03 The Makings Of You (03:42)\n04 We The People Who Are Darker Than Blue (06:05)\n05 Move On Up (08:51)\n06 Miss Black America (02:58)\n07 Wild And Free (03:16)\n08 Give It Up (03:45)\n\nEAC log","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d319e09d167cc1e45f79d90b9126edea357302de","amp;dn":"Curtis+Mayfield+-+%281970%29+Curtis+%5BMFSL+UDCD+781%2C+2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d319e09d167cc1e45f79d90b9126edea357302de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,25,224,157,22,124,193,228,95,121,217,11,145,38,237,234,53,115,2,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
