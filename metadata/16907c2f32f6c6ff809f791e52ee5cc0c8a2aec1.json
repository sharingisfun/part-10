Blue screen of death or code errors? Endless reboots going nowhere? Vista requires you boot into the OS to fix the OS. If the Vista PC or laptop cannot boot you are stuck. New laptops and PC's typically do not come with installation media. Without this you must format and re-install, losing everything on the hard drive.\n\nRun the Windows Vista Recovery Disc from a USB RAM Key instead of having to burn it onto a CD. Good for situations where you don't want to waste a CD or when you do not have a working CD-ROM. This also lets you repair a system without having the Vista installation media!\n\nUses freeware software and easy step-by-step instructions. Lets you boot into Vista Recovery and Rescue utilities when you cannot boot Vista on a PC or laptop.\n\nResulting USB Key will boot up in NT / Vista or DOS.\n\nSize: 122 MB\n\nRequires at least a 128MB USB RAM Key (V1.0, V1.1, V2.0)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16907c2f32f6c6ff809f791e52ee5cc0c8a2aec1","amp;dn":"USB+Vista+Emergency+Repair+Disk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16907c2f32f6c6ff809f791e52ee5cc0c8a2aec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,144,124,47,50,246,198,255,128,159,121,30,82,238,92,192,200,162,174,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
