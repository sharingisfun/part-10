Lovecraft.  It contains his complete fiction, together with collections of his essays, juvenilia, poetry, and collaborative fiction. [Note: the collection of poetry included here claims to be complete but is not.  I know of at least one VERY politically incorrect poem by Lovecraft which it is missing.] It also contains extracts from Lovecraft's letters.\n\nTwo important essays on Lovecraft by Kerry Bolton and a lecture on Lovecraft by Jonathan Bowden are also included, as are S.T. Joshi's &quot;A Dreamer &amp; A Visionary: H.P. Lovecraft in His Time&quot; and &quot;An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cf23838ed15bc5487a880ffe2dc7c425014ea26","amp;dn":"H.P.+Lovecraft+book+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cf23838ed15bc5487a880ffe2dc7c425014ea26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,242,56,56,237,21,188,84,135,168,128,255,226,220,124,66,80,20,234,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
