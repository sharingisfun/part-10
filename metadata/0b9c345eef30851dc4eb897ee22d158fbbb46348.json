This one is bizarre. Give it a try and see! It creates almost random shapes and object, and it's hard to define a specific abject.  But, just change the parameters/color and other setting around and fill a see why you get, it may even be considered art!\n\nOfficial Web SIte:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments/flame/#top&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments/flame/#top&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFlame Painter is a unique paint program, it belongs to my 'I am an Artist' experimental project. I think with tools which inspires you, everyone can be an artist. You can try it here, change different brush settings and paint your own flame paintings. When you change the background from black to white, the palette changes from additive to subtractive and the feeling of the painting is very different. It's not easy to explain all brush parameters, so I leave this for your experimentation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨With a new update Flame online saves hires pictures - 1680x1050!
