It contains as much information as a voluminous encyclopedia of home remedies, yet it's quick, easy, inviting, and fun to read, with the same friendly and authoritative personality conveyed in their popular call-in radio show. The Graedons also offer a dozen new recipes for food so good for you, it serves as preventive medicine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:557cd891eaa0e51e60493d8b2e5e6379fd67e563","amp;dn":"+People%27s+Pharmacy+Quick+and+Handy+Home+Remedies%3A+Q%26amp%3BAs+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"557cd891eaa0e51e60493d8b2e5e6379fd67e563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,124,216,145,234,160,229,30,96,73,61,139,46,94,99,121,253,103,229,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
