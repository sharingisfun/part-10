His memoir is a reflection on his diverse collection of experiences, both hilarious and heartbreaking.\n\nShort takes us through his career, from his early years with Second City Toronto and Saturday Night Live to his movie stardom. He recalls how he developed some of his enduring charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€manic man-child Ed Grimley, slimy lawyer Nathan Thurm, and the large and bizarrely insensitive Jiminy Glick. Here, too, are his television appearances, from How I Met Your Mother to his Emmy-nominated role in Damages, as well as his stage productions, including his Tony Award-winning performance in Little Me. Throughout, Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, Nora Ephron, Frank Sinatra, and others friends and colleagues share the spotlight.\n\nThis deeply private man brings us into the circle of his family life, from raising his children to the legendary parties he and his wife have hosted. He recounts the pain of losing a brother and both parents by the time he was 20, and of the devastating death of Nancy, his wife of thirty years, in 2010. Despite the hardships, ShortÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life has been full of laughter, and he remains perennially upbeat. In this wise and entertaining memoir, he shares his irrepressible joy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb3adcc31b60ea685d7c03a1fa998ce038fad985","amp;dn":"I+Must+Say%3A+My+Life+as+a+Humble+Comedy+Legend+Martin+Short+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb3adcc31b60ea685d7c03a1fa998ce038fad985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,58,220,195,27,96,234,104,93,124,3,161,250,153,140,224,56,250,217,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
