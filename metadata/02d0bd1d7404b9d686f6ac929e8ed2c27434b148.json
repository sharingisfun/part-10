The biggest shifts involved the closing of their label and the departure of member Brian Bandas, leaving fellow founding members Stephen Barker Liles and Eric Gunderson searching for a new deal in order to move forward. Now, with their biggest hit currently at country radio and a new label home at RCA, Stephen and Eric are releasing their self-titled album on July 24; a collection of 11 harmony-driven songs that reintroduces the duo to fans.\n\nA self-titled album, at face value, is a statement about identity. Working with producer Josh Leo (Alabama, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), Stephen and Eric drive this home with a clear message about who they are and what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about. On their sophomore album, Love and Theft capitalizes on sparkling harmonies, high tempo and sonic depth achieved through their live recording process.\n\nThe lead single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel Eyes,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ currently Top 10 at radio, embodies these elements with a simple, hummable melody and Eagles-esque harmonies. Loose acoustic/electric guitars and a deep rhythm section support the track, allowing it to breathe, while the fat-trimmed arrangement maintains its radio friendly core. Songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Inside Out,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring heartland guitars and some suggestive visuals further draws this out, while Eric sings of the bond he has with his lady in a laid-back, smoky drawl, Cover band playing Lyle Lovett and you and me the only ones singing along. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as if they took the power pop foundation of previous hits like 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Runaway,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but added a little bit of Mellencamp to open it up. It works for them here as Love and Theft come off at points sounding like a more contemporary country version of Foster &amp; Lloyd.\n\nTaking chances in several spots, Stephen and Eric have some surprises up their sleeves. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RunninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Out of AirÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a refreshing blast drawing on a vast array of influences from blues and funk as the guys show off a talent for smooth vocal flows through tough rhythmic transitions. The song is a dynamic showcase with a back and forth echoed in its chorus, Girl, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m gonna run right to you / Then IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m gonna run away. On Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thinking of You (And Me),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sentimental piano introduces the feelings developing within a guy-girl friendship. Full of revolving vocal patterns and floating electric guitars, the song stays just this side of complicated while the drama builds. And on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Amen,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ meticulously crafted instrumental repetition including hand claps and guitar fills give life to an easygoing love song.\n\nThe vocal chemistry between Stephen and Eric is front and center. Sometimes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pronounced, like in the bright, layered chorus of the power ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You Ever Get Lonely.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ At other times, it can be subtle, like through the gritty and endearing story of friendship, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Town Drunk.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ However, the natural and often complex harmonies are a focal point in the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound.\n\nLove and Theft delivers a statement on what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about and where theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re headed. Rooted in a pop/crossover sound, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a natural feel to the collection as they build off their previous work. Even songs like the mirror image party tunes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls Love to Shake ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls Look Hot in TrucksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ further develop their sound. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an exciting step for Stephen and Eric, and one that shows them finding their voice on a refreshed and rejuvenated album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d0bd1d7404b9d686f6ac929e8ed2c27434b148","amp;dn":"Love+and+Theft+-+Love+And+Theft+%5B2012%5D%5B+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d0bd1d7404b9d686f6ac929e8ed2c27434b148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,208,189,29,116,4,185,214,134,246,172,146,158,142,210,194,116,52,177,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
