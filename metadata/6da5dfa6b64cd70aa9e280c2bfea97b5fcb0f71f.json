Lanois is at www.redfloorrecords.com.  Google Robbie Robertson, and you can find his discs, too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da5dfa6b64cd70aa9e280c2bfea97b5fcb0f71f","amp;dn":"Daniel+Lanois+Robbie+Robertson+Mashup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da5dfa6b64cd70aa9e280c2bfea97b5fcb0f71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,165,223,166,182,76,215,10,169,226,128,194,191,234,151,181,252,176,247,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
