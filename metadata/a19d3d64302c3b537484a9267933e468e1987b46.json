Both &quot;Masakhane&quot; and a reworking of her international hit from the &amp;#039;60s (&quot;Pata Pata 2000&quot;) positively shimmer with loping South African rhythms and harmonies. But Makeba is also an accomplished ballad and jazz singer, and both of those facets are shown, in songs like &quot;Amaliya&quot; and &quot;Unhome,&quot; where the piano work recalls the township jazz of people like Abdullah Ibrahim and Chris MacGregor. Makeba&amp;#039;s voice has acquired a compassion and even greater control as she&amp;#039;s grown older, but she never sounds old--in fact, there&amp;#039;s an incredible energy about this record. While every track is a joy, the real highlights come when the rootsy elements are emphasized and things simply kick. If you thought Graceland or Ladysmith Black Mambazo encapsulated the sound of South Africa, take a listen to this--the country&amp;#039;s queen of song has returned in full voice.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
