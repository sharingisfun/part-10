I start from the\nbeginning (where else?) and work my way from early concepts through more\nsophisticated techniques. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t assume that you have any prior knowledge\n(at least, not of programming).\nThe book is full of examples. Every concept is documented in numerous snippets\nand several complete programs.\nUnlike other C++ programming books, C++ For Dummies considers the Ã¢â‚¬Å“whyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\njust as important as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“how.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The features of C++ are like pieces of a jigsaw\npuzzle. Rather than just present the features, I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important that you\nunderstand how they fit together. You can also use the book as a reference:\nIf you want to understand whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on with all the template stuff, for\nexample, just flip to Chapter 26. Each chapter contains necessary references\nto other earlier chapters in case you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t read the chapters in sequence.\nC++ For Dummies is not operating systemÃ¢â‚¬â€œspecific. It is just as useful to\nMacintosh or Linux programmers as it is to Windows-based developers. The\nbook doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover Windows or .NET programming.\nYou have to master a powerful programming language, like C++, first even if\nyour plan is to become an accomplished Windows application or .NET programmer.\nOnce youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve finished C++ For Dummies you will be in position to\ncontinue in your area of specialization, whatever it might be.\nIn this modern era of hackerdom, learning defensive programming is important,\neven for beginners, so I do cover important concepts to keep your program\nfrom being hacked.\n\n\nBy Stephen R.
