For years, she has traveled to a holy place in her dreamsÃ¢â‚¬â€a sublime place she calls the Living Room. When she awakes, her faith and energy are supernaturally restored. And when she dreams, she receives vibrant inspiration for her novels. \n\nAs she begins to write her third book, the nature of her dreams shifts. Gone are the literary signposts. Instead, her dreams are studded with scenes that foreshadow real life. Before long, the scenes begin to spill over into her waking hours too.\n\nAs Amy becomes entangled in a high stakes case at work, her visions take on a dark hueÃ¢â‚¬â€implicating someone dear to her, causing her to question everything. And convincing her to trust someone with his own shadowy secrets.\n\nThings are not always what they seem. But as fiction, dreams, and real life begin to overlap, Amy must stop dreaming and act to prevent tragedy.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With deft sleight of hand, wonderful characterization, and carefully layered plots, Robert Whitlow has crafted a gripping story about the mysteries of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power to shelter the people he loves.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Erin Healy, author of Afloat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be2add96403ec41b92c43507ed04b72cdda2ef87","amp;dn":"The+Living+Room+-+Robert+Whitlow.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be2add96403ec41b92c43507ed04b72cdda2ef87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,42,221,150,64,62,196,27,146,196,53,7,237,4,183,44,221,162,239,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
