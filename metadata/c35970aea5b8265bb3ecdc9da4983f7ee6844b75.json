One day she recieves a video tape on which a certain Alberto Knox talks directly to her from ancient Greece. They then start to meet at different occasions and throughout the film, Alberto takes Sofie on an odyssey of the history of philosophy, from ancient Greece, over the Roman empire, the Middle ages, the renaissance, the enlightenment, the big revolutions and up to today. Throughout this journey, they start to realise that they are only fictions of a story writer's imagination and start conceiving a plan for escaping into reality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35970aea5b8265bb3ecdc9da4983f7ee6844b75","amp;dn":"Sophies.World.1999.HDRip.x264-adinbied.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35970aea5b8265bb3ecdc9da4983f7ee6844b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,89,112,174,165,184,38,91,179,236,220,157,164,152,63,126,230,132,75,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
