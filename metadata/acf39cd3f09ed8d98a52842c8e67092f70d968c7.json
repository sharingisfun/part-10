Bronzino, Donald R. Peterson (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4398-2519-8\r\n\r\nKnown as the bible of biomedical engineering, The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, Fourth Edition, sets the standard against which all other references of this nature are measured. As such, it has served as a major resource for both skilled professionals and novices to biomedical engineering.\r\n\r\nBiomedical Engineering Fundamentals, the first volume of the handbook, presents material from respected scientists with diverse backgrounds in physiological systems, biomechanics, biomaterials, bioelectric phenomena, and neuroengineering.\r\n\r\nMore than three dozen specific topics are examined, including cardiac biomechanics, the mechanics of blood vessels, cochlear mechanics, biodegradable biomaterials, soft tissue replacements, cellular biomechanics, neural engineering, electrical stimulation for paraplegia, and visual prostheses. The material is presented in a systematic manner and has been updated to reflect the latest applications and research findings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acf39cd3f09ed8d98a52842c8e67092f70d968c7","amp;dn":"Biomedical+Engineering+Fundamentals+4th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acf39cd3f09ed8d98a52842c8e67092f70d968c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,243,156,211,240,158,216,217,138,82,132,44,142,103,9,47,112,217,104,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
