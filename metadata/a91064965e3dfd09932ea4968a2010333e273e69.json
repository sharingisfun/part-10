Paula Cole won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nSinger-songwriter Paula Cole bares her soul on her self-produced second album, displaying even more self-confidence than on HARBINGER. There is a sense of breaking with the past, especially on tracks like &quot;Tiger,&quot; where Cole revisits the symbolic &quot;Bethlehem&quot; of her first album, singing, &quot;I've left Bethlehem and I feel free/I've left the girl I was supposed to be.&quot; Lyrically, THIS FIRE is ferocious and unrestrained, and Cole's limber voice is suitably raw and versatile, veering from whispery-soft to edgy and emotional, delivering a fearlessly personal message.\n\nWhen she sings, &quot;You call me a bitch in heat/And I call you a liar&quot; (on &quot;Throwing Stones&quot;), the word &quot;liar&quot; emerges as a furious scream. The next track, &quot;Carmen,&quot; in contrast, is gently nostalgic. Cole's songs are emotionally complex and open to interpretation, but they are never deliberately vague, and her subtle wit saves THIS FIRE from self-absorption.\n\nRecorded at Bearsville Studio, Bearsville, New York; The Magic Shop, Paula's apartment and Shelter Island Studio, New York, New York.\n\nPersonnel: Paula Cole (vocals, didjeridu, clarinet, tuba, piano, harmonium, organ, Wurlitzer organ, xylophone); Peter Gabriel (vocals); SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©amus Egan (whistling, Uilleann pipe); Greg Leisz (guitar, lap steel guitar); Gerry Leonard (guitar, strings); Wenyi Shih, Liz Knowles (violin); Judith Insell (viola); Chase Morrison (cello); Tony Levin (Chapman stick); Jay Bellerose (drums, percussion).\n\nAudio Mixers: Gerry Leonard ; Roger Moutenot.\n\nRecording information: Bearsville Studio, Bearsvill, NY; Paula's Apartment, New York, NY; Shelter Island Studio, New York, NY; The Magic Shop, New York, NY.\n\nPhotographers: Jodie Olson; D.
