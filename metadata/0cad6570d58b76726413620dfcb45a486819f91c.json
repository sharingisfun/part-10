The album was on August 20, 2013 by Tan Cressida and Columbia Records. The album follows his free-album Earl which was released in 2010 when he was sixteen. After returning from a stay in a Samoan boarding school, he began working on his debut album and signed a deal with Columbia, rather than Odd Future's Odd Future Records.\n\nDoris features guest appearances from Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Casey Veggies, Vince Staples, Tyler, the Creator, RZA and Mac Miller. Production was primarily handled by Christian Rich and Sweatshirt under the pseudonym randomblackdude. Additional production came from Matt Martians, The Neptunes, RZA, Samiyam, Frank Ocean, and Tyler, The Creator. The album was supported by three singles; &quot;Chum&quot;, &quot;Woah&quot; featuring Tyler, The Creator, and &quot;Hive&quot; featuring Vince Staples and Casey Veggies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cad6570d58b76726413620dfcb45a486819f91c","amp;dn":"%26quot%3BEarl+Sweatshirt+-+Doris%26quot%3B+320+MP3+kbps%2CComplete+ID3+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cad6570d58b76726413620dfcb45a486819f91c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,173,101,112,213,139,118,114,100,19,98,13,252,180,90,72,104,25,249,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
