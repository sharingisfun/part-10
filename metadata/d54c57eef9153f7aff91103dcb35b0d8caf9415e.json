I know, so I gave it a great eBook for programming series that teaches the hackers in mislih.EBook is called &quot;batch programming&quot;. I know who would have thought.\n\nBut before I give you access to the eBook, you must first know what the packet Programming.\n\nPackage files are essentially a sequence of DOS commands saved to a text file with the extension &quot;BAT&quot;. When work is a lot out every line in a batch file, as if typed into the console. So basically, a file containing DOS commands that you normally type at the command prompt.\n\nBatch file is used mainly for repeat tasks. Instead of typing commands over and over again to do a certain task, you can create a batch file that does all this automatically with the implementation of a bulk set of commands.\n\nSo why would hackers know the batch programming? Well I'll give you some ideas and you can decide for yourself:\n\nattacks\n\n      DNS poisoning\n      packet flooders\n      Dictionary attacks\n      creating viruses\n      Disable services\n      billing logs\n\n\ndisturbances\n\n      Bombers (Fork, Broadcast)\n      Annoyers msg\n      Flooders (user folders)\n      Extension Changer (eg html -&gt; exe)\n      Pressing the key remapper\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54c57eef9153f7aff91103dcb35b0d8caf9415e","amp;dn":"Batch+File+Programming-2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54c57eef9153f7aff91103dcb35b0d8caf9415e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,76,87,238,249,21,63,122,255,145,16,61,203,53,176,216,202,249,65,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
