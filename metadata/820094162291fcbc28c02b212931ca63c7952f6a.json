Songs\n                   like &quot;Fine Time&quot; and &quot;Back Of My Mind&quot; have got that magical\n                   quality The LaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s demos had. They feel very precious.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\n                   Released in 1995, All Change was to become the fastest-\n                   selling debut in PolydorÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s history, outstripping The Who,\n                   Jimi Hendrix and The Jam. The album sold over one million\n                   copies and spawned four Top 20 singles: &quot;Alright&quot;,\n                   &quot;Sandstorm&quot;, &quot;Finetime&quot; and &quot;Walkaway&quot;. The stand-alone\n                   single, &quot;Flying&quot;, which reached Number 4 in the UK charts\n                   also features on this deluxe edition both in the form of the\n                   original studio recording as well as one of JohnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s earlier\n                   demos.  Cast aficionados will also be delighted by the\n                   inclusion of the outtake, &quot;All My Days&quot;, which has achieved\n                   near-mythical status amongst fans.\n\n                   Originally the bass player with Merseyside band, The LaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s,\n                   John Power started writing the material that would\n                   eventually become songs for Cast in the early 1990s. On\n                   leaving The LaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s, he started putting together a group that\n                   by 1994 would feature the classic line-up of: John Power\n                   (guitar/vocals), Liam ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦SkinÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  Tyson (lead guitar), Pete\n                   Wilkinson (bass) and Keith OÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â Neill (drums). The group split\n                   in 2001 but in summer 2010 John Power announced that this\n                   very same line-up are getting together again with plans to\n                   work on new material and for a series of live UK dates.\n\n     [ Tracklist ]\n\n        cd1\n\n     01.Alright                                  [03:37]\n     02.Promised Land                            [04:37]\n     03.Sandstorm                                [02:42]\n     04.Mankind                                  [03:45]\n     05.Tell It Like It Is                       [04:41]\n     06.Four Walls                               [03:10]\n     07.Fine Time                                [03:07]\n     08.Back Of My Mind                          [03:05]\n     09.Walkaway                                 [03:52]\n     10.Reflections                              [03:05]\n     11.History                                  [04:26]\n     12.Two Of A Kind                            [08:14]\n     13.Instrumental (Original Hidden Track)     [01:28]\n     14.Flying (Single)                          [03:55]\n     15.Better Man (B-Side)                      [03:01]\n     16.Satellites (B-Side)                      [03:39]\n     17.Follow Me Down (B-Side)                  [03:40]\n     18.Meet Me (B-Side)                         [03:45]\n     19.Hourglass (B-Side)                       [03:13]\n     20.Mother (B-Side)                          [03:29]\n     21.For So Long (B-Side)                     [02:52]\n\n        cd2\n\n     01.Sandstorm (Demo)                         [02:19]\n     02.Who You Gonna Ask?
