Virtually all of Louis Jordan's hits, which musically bridged the gap between small-group swing, R&amp;B, and rock &amp; roll, are on this single CD, including &quot;Choo Choo Ch'Boogie,&quot; &quot;Let the Good Times Roll,&quot; &quot;Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry,&quot; &quot;Caldonia,&quot; &quot;Five Guys Named Moe,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying.&quot; Serious collectors will want to explore a more complete series, particularly the one put out by Classics, but for a single acquisition, this is the Louis Jordan set to get. Jordan's very likable and good-humored vocals and his hot alto, as well as the playing of the Tympani Five, belong in everyone's music collection.\n\nTracklist\n\n1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Choo Choo Ch'Boogie Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ D.
