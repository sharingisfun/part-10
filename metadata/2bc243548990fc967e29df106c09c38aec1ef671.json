There are an unprecedented number of sophisticated attacks on the origin, credibility, and reliability of the Bible. It can be difficult to know what to say when skepticism and secularism take over so many conversations. Additionally, confusion and doubt about the Bible being God's Word are becoming as common inside the church as they are in the broader culture. The purpose of this book is to respond to these challenges, sound bites, and slogans...and give people confidence that the Bible can be trusted and that it matters for our lives because God really has spoken.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc243548990fc967e29df106c09c38aec1ef671","amp;dn":"Questioning+the+Bible%3A+11+Major+Challenges+to+the+Bible%27s+Author","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc243548990fc967e29df106c09c38aec1ef671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,194,67,84,137,144,252,150,126,41,223,16,108,9,195,138,236,30,246,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
