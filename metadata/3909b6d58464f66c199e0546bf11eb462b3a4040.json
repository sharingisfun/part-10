The suite is attractively priced for substantial savings over purchasing individual software packages. \n\nMultisim is an intuitive environment for circuit design. With advanced mixed-mode simulation and validation, this software offers professional tools for your research and prototyping. And using a comprehensive library of components, you can easily build and validate circuit behavior. \n\nUltiboard is a flexible PCB layout and routing environment. Easily transfer completed Multisim schematics to Ultiboard and layout, route, and export completed designs for fabrication. \n\nThe NI Circuit Design Suite is available in Base, Full, and Power Pro editions.\n\n\nActivation included (.lic files).\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ni.com/multisim/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ni.com/multisim/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAJcAaAcn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAJcAaAcn&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3909b6d58464f66c199e0546bf11eb462b3a4040","amp;dn":"National+Instruments+Circuit+Design+Suite+11.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3909b6d58464f66c199e0546bf11eb462b3a4040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,9,182,213,132,100,246,108,25,158,5,70,191,17,235,70,43,58,64,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
