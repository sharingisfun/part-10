Frances is an apprentice for a dance company, but shes not really a dancer. Frances has a best friend named Sophie, but they aren't really speaking anymore. Frances throws herself headlong into her dreams, even as their possible reality dwindles. Frances wants so much more than she has but lives her life with unaccountable joy and lightness. FRANCES HA is a modern comic fable that explores New York, friendship, class, ambition, failure, and redemption.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b3871edad8eb089da3992345f5182245333e0e6","amp;dn":"Frances+Ha+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b3871edad8eb089da3992345f5182245333e0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,56,113,237,173,142,176,137,218,57,146,52,95,81,130,36,83,51,224,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
