Has a number of changes compared to the original program: it is possible to minimize the code includes support for bookmarks, auto-completion typing a word, there are lights AutoHotkey syntax, AutoIt3, AviSynth, Bash, CMake, Inno Setup, LaTeX, Lua, Markdown, NSIS, Ruby, Tcl YAML and scripts, improved mapping method NFO ANSI, other more minor changes and tweaks. \r\nNotepad2-mod works fine on Windows XP SP3 (SP2 can not run), Vista, 7, 8 and 8.1 and 32-bit and 64-bit. There is a portable version of the program, it is in the archive, it is necessary to start just unzip the file and you can begin to use it, as I understand it, registry entries leaves. Please note that the Russian support is not, at least I could not find it, I think it may not like some of our users, others who do not pay attention, I think will appreciate the possibility of Notepad2-mod appreciated. \r\nIn its long-term test does not, no problem at work, I have not met, a portable version starts immediately, perfectly opens large files. The program's interface is clean, it does not have anything extra, generally if you work with a notebook, you'll be able to sort out all the rest like a text editor. \r\nDeveloper: XhmikosR \r\nLicense: FreeWare \r\nLanguage: English \r\nSize: 2.69 MB \r\nOS: Windows \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]How to Install:[/b]\r\n\r\n1).
