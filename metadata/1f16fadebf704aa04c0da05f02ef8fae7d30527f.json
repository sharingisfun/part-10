The first Rocky is still the best, with classic cues like &quot;Going the Distance,&quot; &quot;Fanfare for Rocky,&quot; the &quot;Final Bell&quot; and &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; -- the latter was actually a hit single -- eschewing the myriad of questionable AOR songs that would end up cluttering future installments. [In 2006, Capitol released the 30th Anniversary Edition of Rocky which featured the original play list remastered in 24-bit digital, with photos and liner notes from Stallone himself.]\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Gonna Fly Now (Theme from Rocky) - DeEtta Little, Nelson Pigford  [2:48]\n02 - Philadelphia Morning - Valentine  [2:22]\n03 - Going the Distance - Valentine  [2:40]\n04 - Reflections - Valentine  [3:19]\n05 - Harine's Hymm/Yankee Doodle - Valentine  [1:45]\n06 - Take You Back (Street Corner Song) [Rocky] - Valentine  [1:49]\n07 - First Date - DeEtta Little, Nelson Pigford  [1:54]\n08 - You Take My Heart Away - DeEtta Little, Nelson Pigford  [4:46]\n09 - Fanfare for Rocky - Bill Conti  [2:12]\n10 - Butkus - Bill Conti  [1:09]\n11 - Alone in the Ring - Bill Conti  [1:56]\n12 - The Final Bell - Bill Conti  [1:56]\n13 - Rocky's Reward - Bill Conti  [2:03]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f16fadebf704aa04c0da05f02ef8fae7d30527f","amp;dn":"Rocky+-+Soundtrack+%281977%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f16fadebf704aa04c0da05f02ef8fae7d30527f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,22,250,222,191,112,74,160,76,13,160,95,2,239,143,174,125,48,82,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
