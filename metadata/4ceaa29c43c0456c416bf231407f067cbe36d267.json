With this simple replacement file the game will think that you played the MP to get max readiness, so you can get your war assets the legit way and play the game the way it's meant to be played. This works for pirated copies and will also work for legit copies as long as you do not connect to the internet (setting your firewall to block the game's requests will take care of that.\n\nThe Instructions folder has an easy to follow guide to help you on your way to the best ending. Credit goes to the forum once again for this wonderful workaround.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ceaa29c43c0456c416bf231407f067cbe36d267","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+3+Readiness+Level+Cheat+%28Works+on+all+PC+copies%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ceaa29c43c0456c416bf231407f067cbe36d267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,234,162,156,67,192,69,108,65,107,242,49,64,127,6,124,190,54,210,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
