The Lovely Bones, Alice Sebold's haunting and heartbreaking debut novel, unfolds from heaven, where &quot;life is a perpetual yesterday&quot; and where Susie narrates and keeps watch over her grieving family and friends, as well as her brazen killer and the sad detective working on her case.\r\n\r\nSusie struggles to accept her death while still clinging to the lost world of the living, following her family's dramas over the years. Her family disintegrates in their grief: her father becomes determined to find her killer, her mother withdraws, her little brother Buckley attempts to make sense of the new hole in his family and her younger sister Lindsey moves through the milestone events of her teenage and young adult years with Susie riding spiritual shotgun. Random acts and missed opportunities run throughout the book--Susie recalls her sole kiss with a boy on earth as &quot;like an accident--a beautiful gasoline rainbow&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:362d62982ee587f23707f0e0c3a035cf86c52e68","amp;dn":"The+Lovely+Bones+audiobook+by+Alice+Sebold+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"362d62982ee587f23707f0e0c3a035cf86c52e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,45,98,152,46,229,135,242,55,7,240,224,195,160,53,207,134,197,46,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
