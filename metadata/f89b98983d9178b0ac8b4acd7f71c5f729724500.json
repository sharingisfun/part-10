The young Garrett took an interest and soon learned to play. A year later, he took part in a competition and won first prize. By the age of seven, he studied violin at the LÃƒÂ¼beck Conservatoire,[3] and by the age of 12, Garrett began working with the distinguished Polish violinist Ida Haendel, often traveling to London and other European cities to meet her.[4] After leaving home at 17, he enrolled in the Royal College of Music in London,[5] leaving after the first semester. On being asked in an interview if he was expelled, Garrett responded: &quot;Well expelled wasn't the official termÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ It was mutually agreed that me and the RCM were going separate ways after the first semester. I did skip some lessons Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but I also broke in to do extra practice, so that didn't help!&quot;[6] In 1999 he moved to New York to attend the Juilliard School, in 2003 winning the Composition Competition of Juilliard School with a fugue composed in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach.[1] While at Juilliard he studied under Itzhak Perlman, one of the first to do so,[4] and graduated in 2004.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f89b98983d9178b0ac8b4acd7f71c5f729724500","amp;dn":"David+Garrett+Discography+2007+-+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f89b98983d9178b0ac8b4acd7f71c5f729724500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,155,152,152,61,145,120,176,172,139,74,205,127,113,197,247,41,114,69,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
