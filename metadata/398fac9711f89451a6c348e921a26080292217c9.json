Both Nugent and his band are in top form, yielding a fierce performance of their numerous mid-'70s classics. Mega-hit &quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot; makes an obligatory appearance, but it's the songs from Nugent's self-titled debut which truly stand out. &quot;Just What the Doctor Ordered&quot; is damn near perfect, and the band really clicks on extended jams through &quot;Motor City Madhouse&quot; and the fantastic &quot;Stranglehold.&quot; A consummate showman, Nugent also unleashes a number of hilarious, motormouth stage raps on &quot;Baby Please Don't Go&quot; and &quot;Wang Dang Sweet Poontang&quot; before offering the definitive version of his early classic &quot;Great White Buffalo.&quot; In the year of the live album (1978), this one's about as good as they come. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:398fac9711f89451a6c348e921a26080292217c9","amp;dn":"Ted+Nugent+-+Double+Live+Gonzo+1978+%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"398fac9711f89451a6c348e921a26080292217c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,143,172,151,17,248,148,81,166,195,72,233,33,162,96,128,41,34,23,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
