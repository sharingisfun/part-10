Your ability to be free from alcohol, feeling powerful and in control, is in your mind. Of course your body has to adapt to releasing the effects of alcohol as well. When you stop the mental and habitual need, your body can begin to heal.\n\nJust as your body heals from illness, it will heal from the damaging effects of alcohol. In order to create clarity in your mind about your future ability to be free from alcohol, you must release the habitual and emotional bonds that alcohol has on your life every minute of every day.\n\t\n\n\nYou can do this. BUT you will have to change your thinking in a massive way. If you will commit to this audio program, you will find that you feel differently about drinking. You will begin to feel more powerful and in control, readier than ever to live with freedom for all the right reasons. This hypnotherapy program will take you step by step through the process of healing your past, creating the future, changing habits, and releasing deep seated triggers. Feel better fast.\n\nMost people who use this program say they just forget about drinking in less than a week. They don't struggle and worry. People are experiencing a sense of freedom even if they have failed at other attempts to stop drinking in the past.\n\nThis Complete Program for Being Free from Alcohol includes:\n\nSIX CDS with over 20 sessions and a journal that will help you on your path to Alcohol Freedom.\n\nDisc 1\n1. Introduction- Is alcoholism a disease? Why does hypnosis work to release the need for alcohol? Do you need to be powerless or powerful to be a non-drinker?\n2. Trance Training- Teach your brain and body to achieve a deep state of trance quickly. Great for those who have never done any hypnosis or meditation.\n3. Direct Suggestion- Powerful suggestions that are given during hypnosis to make you positive and in control around alcohol. Only positive suggestions are used in this session.\n\nDisc 2\n1. Introduction to the Alcohol Zapper\n2. Alcohol Zapper- a great process to help you almost instantly lose your interest in alcohol. This changes the way your brain finds the triggers and emotions that were connected to your need to drink. A quick and logical process of making new pathways in your brain for successful subconscious thought patterns.\n3. Introduction to Future Time Line- Learn how this methodology can create a belief about the kind of person you are, the qualities you posses and the values that guide you through your life.\n4. Future Timeline- One of the most powerful things you will do to create a solid commitment about your future self. Going into an imaginary future will implant these future memories into your subconscious mind as beliefs. It gives your mind the values and strategies to lose your desire for alcohol, but even more important to create the life you really want.\n\nDisc 3\n1. Parts Therapy- Self Sabotage is the most destructive element of any major life change. Your subconscious mind may feel that there is a positive reason that you drink. We want to find the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½partÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ that needs to drink, and talk to it. It may be an escape, or offer protection, or alleviate pain. There is ALWAYS a positive intention behind the drinking. The reason that people have so much trouble quitting drinking is often because this self sabotage kicks in and the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½partÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ needs to get itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s needs met. You will find the part, find the positive intention and resolve the conflict. I think this is the reason that most people are successful with this program. The conflict is resolved and the battle is over.\n2. Timeline of the Past- This session will take you into your past to find the time when your inner mind decided that alcohol was the best solution to the problem. It could be that as a child you were around your father or mother when they drank and you felt loved. A powerful connection is created with the smell of alcohol and the need to feel loved. We will dissolve the anchor that was using alcohol to try to feel this positive emotion. This session will most likely be a great breakthrough for you.\n3. Temple of Wisdom- You have an infinite amount of wisdom and insight about your problem. In this session you will discover what your deepest needs are. You will create a temple of wisdom and meet a wise guru. This guru will tell you what you need to do to release your alcohol conflicts and to create the best life possible. As you silently speak to this guru, you will be giving answers that are unique to your situation. Wendi is not telling you the answers, they are coming from the source of wisdom in your mind.\n4. Release Negative Anchors- All around you there are triggers that make you want to drink. You probably donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t even know that there are unconscious feelings and thoughts that are being triggered around your house, office, car, etc. This amazing (I donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t say that lightly) process will release the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½hookÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ that has been triggering your need to drink. Most people tell me this creates an intense sense of relief.\n\nDisc 4\n1. Morning Meditation- you will use this as you awaken. It starts very quietly and slowly and awakens you to create the intention for your day. You choose the thoughts and words that will guide you into your intention and my voice will reinforce that this is what you choose for your day. If you have a CD alarm clock, you can make this CD come on automatically as your alarm. What a refreshing way to awaken.\n2. Addiction Freedom- End the addictive patterns and the feeling of need. This can be used for many things other than alcohol, so if you decide to apply it to other addictive aspects of your personality you can feel the sense of freedom, no longer needing to identify with being an addictive personality.\n3. Moderation- Some people need to cut down on their drinking and have the personality to simply have a drink now and then. This session will help you to enjoy just one, or you may find that you take a few sips and you are not interested in more. I cannot tell you how happy people are to just have a half a beer or a few sips of wine. It is amazingly simple and for some people this is a good solution. Some people just want to cut down.\n4. Aversion Therapy- For those that need a hard core approach. This session uses very negative and aversive approach to make you repulsed when you think about alcohol. Only use this as a last resort.\n\nDisc 5\n1 Depression Introduction Learn about the connection of depression and drinking. Clearing your issues that are causing depression can be a tremendous help. If you let your mind focus on the good that you are creating, and lift the depression, you wont feel so inclined to drink. Learn how the combination of thoughts, emotions and memories create a chemical state of depression. Find out why this hypnotherapy session changes the chemical balance in your brain.\n2 Depression Buster You will make your brain find the positive memories in your life and expand them. The more you focus on the good and positive experiences, the more endorphins you produce in your brain and body. The flood of good chemicals will affect your body and your mood.
