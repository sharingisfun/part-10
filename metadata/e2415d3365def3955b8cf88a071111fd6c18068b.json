Erdman discusses the importance of language and how youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to use it to enrich your life and have more success once you master his techniques.\n\nRapport\n\nErdman touches on is what he calls the 70/30 principle. The idea being that you should aim to be listening for 70% of the time and only speaking for 30%. \n\nAttraction\n\nThis is the final section of the program and is just over two hours long. The first track is on four common mistakes guys often make to mess up attraction.\nThere are a number of tracks here dealing with questions and how to respond to them.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPimp Your Lingo uses a lot of ideas from Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) to teach some fairly basic conversational skills. \n\nBiography\n\n\nThe Actor Stephan Erdman is one of the leading German actors \nbased in the UK.\n\nHe is best known for his numerous Film/TV roles for the BBC and directors like Peter Howitt,\nLab Ky Mo, Jamie Payne and Richard Dale and his many Stage performances...\n\n...while also attracting major brands like Xbox360, Skechers, Apple, Nike, RBS, Ericksson, \nBelkin, Visa and Sony as an actor, model and voice over artist for Commercials and \nPhotographic Campaigns.\n\nClick here to see Stephan Erdman's IMDb Resume: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258772/resume\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.datingskillsreview.com/pimp-your-lingo-advanced-conversation-skills-training-for-men-too-shy-to-date-stephan-erdman/#ixzz2m9OGFVUy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.datingskillsreview.com/pimp-your-lingo-advanced-conversation-skills-training-for-men-too-shy-to-date-stephan-erdman/#ixzz2m9OGFVUy&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2415d3365def3955b8cf88a071111fd6c18068b","amp;dn":"Stephan+Erdman+-+Pimp+Your+Lingo+Advanced+Conversation+Skills+Tr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2415d3365def3955b8cf88a071111fd6c18068b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,65,93,51,101,222,243,149,91,140,248,138,7,17,17,253,108,24,6,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
