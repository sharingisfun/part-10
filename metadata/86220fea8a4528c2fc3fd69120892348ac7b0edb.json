McCormack moves to a small town where the local government has banned dancing and rock music. Ren and his classmates want to have a senior prom with music and dancing. They must figure out a way to get around the law and Reverend Shaw Moore, played by John Lithgow, who blames rock music's influence for the death of his first child.\nThe movie was loosely based on events that took place in the tiny, rural farming community of Elmore City, Oklahoma.[1] Much of the film was filmed in Utah County, Utah. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootloose 1984\n\nFootloose is the original soundtrack of the Paramount Motion Picture, Footloose. The original nine-track album was released in 1984 (see 1984 in music) and reached Number One on the Billboard 200 Pop Album chart on April 21, 1984, where it stayed until June 30, 1984. When it was re-released in 1998, four bonus tracks were added to the album. In 2002, Sony International released the Australian Souvenir Edition (aka Australian Cast Special Edition). Two megamixes were added to the album, featuring the Australian Cast of the Footloose musical. The original soundtrack contained three Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 hits, including two #1 hits, Kenny Loggins' &quot;Footloose&quot; and Deniece Williams' &quot;Let's Hear It for the Boy&quot;, and &quot;Almost Paradise&quot;, a duet by Ann Wilson and Mike Reno that reached #7.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Footloose&quot; - Kenny Loggins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 (Kenny Loggins/Dean Pitchford)\n2.\t&quot;Let's Hear It for the Boy&quot; - Deniece Williams ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20 (Tom Snow/Dean Pitchford)\n3.\t&quot;Almost Paradise&quot; (Love theme from Footloose) - Ann Wilson and Mike Reno ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51 (Eric Carmen/Dean Pitchford)\n4.\t&quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot; - Bonnie Tyler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:49 (Jim Steinman/Dean Pitchford)\n5.\t&quot;Dancing In the Sheets&quot; - Shalamar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 (Bill Wolfer/Dean Pitchford)\n6.\t&quot;I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man)&quot; - Kenny Loggins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 (Kenny Loggins/Dean Pitchford)\n7.\t&quot;Somebody's Eyes&quot; - Karla Bonoff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 (Tom Snow/Dean Pitchford)\n8.\t&quot;The Girl Gets Around&quot; - Sammy Hagar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 (Sammy Hagar/Dean Pitchford)\n9.\t&quot;Never&quot; - Moving Pictures ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 (Michael Gore/Dean Pitchford)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86220fea8a4528c2fc3fd69120892348ac7b0edb","amp;dn":"Footloose+-+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+1984+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86220fea8a4528c2fc3fd69120892348ac7b0edb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,34,15,234,138,69,40,194,252,63,214,145,32,137,35,72,172,123,14,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
