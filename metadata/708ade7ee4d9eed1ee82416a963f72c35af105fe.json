That comes clear when Director Nick Fury is killed by the mysterious assassin, the Winter Soldier, but not before warning Rogers that SHIELD has been subverted by its enemies. When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one there, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of the Black Widow and his new friend, The Falcon. However, the battle will be costly for the Sentinel of Liberty, with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them while learning that the Winter Soldier looks disturbingly familiar.\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\nRelease date: 4 April 2014 (USA)\n\nGen Info\n\nFormat: Matroska\nFile Size: 1.48 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 557 Kbps\nDuration: 02:15:54\nSample: Included\nEncoder: prisak\n\nVideo Info\n\nContainer: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nEncoding type: 2 Pass TURBO 1ST PASS\nResolution: 1280 X 544 pixels\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\nAudio Info\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AC-3\nBitrate Mode: Constant\nBitrate: 256 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels (Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE)\n\nTHanks to HKRG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:708ade7ee4d9eed1ee82416a963f72c35af105fe","amp;dn":"Captain+America+The+Winter+Soldier+%282014%29+BDRip+720p+x264+DD5.1-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"708ade7ee4d9eed1ee82416a963f72c35af105fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,138,222,126,228,217,238,209,238,130,65,106,150,63,114,195,90,241,5,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
