While the western world often defines Toho by its iconic classics, which include the Godzilla franchise and many of the greatest films of the legendary director Akira Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune, these pictures represent but a tiny fraction of Toho's rich history.\n\nThe Toho Studios Story: A History and Complete Filmography provides a complete picture of every Toho feature the Japanese studio produced and releasedÃ¢â‚¬â€¢as well as foreign films that it distributedÃ¢â‚¬â€¢during its first 75 years.
