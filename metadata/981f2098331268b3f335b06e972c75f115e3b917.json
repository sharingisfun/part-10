That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\nI have decided on the makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are possible. I plan on 15 more. Most are 13-18gb. The Superman torrent will be around 35-38gb. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman.\n\n41 Spe-Stq (Minus Star)\n42 Star*\n43 Str-Supera\n44 Superb-Supq (Minus Superman(Space or Dash) - #44 WILL include titles that start with Superman's\n45 Superman\n46 Supr-Td\n47 Te-Tn\n48 To-Unk\n49 Unl-Waq\n50 War-Wn\n51 Wonder*\n52 World*\n53 Wo-Z (Minus Wonder, World)\n54 Fill Torent A-D\n55 Fill Tor\n\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from Sham-Spd\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nShazam!\n     Shazam!

(That's when she laughed)\nBut Sherlock Holmes in the original Arthur Conan Doyle works is a long time favorite of mine, so I made sure to get some extra SH in here even though DC only did the one issue.  I have also found a some of the later stories by new authors in books, radio and film, in addition to some of the adaptations of Doyle, that I thought were pretty good. The latest theatrical film (2009) is good as a film but it's not Sherlock Holmes IMAO (a is for arrogant-know it-all,  They should just have called it something else and removed the obvious Holmes tie-ins. But the tie-ins probably seemed a money maker. Of course in the opposite spirit  they really should have called  &quot;Real Steel&quot;  -  the new robot boxing movie,  &quot;Rock'm-Sock'm Robots&quot; with the line &quot;You knocked my block off&quot; prominently  placed somewhere. Back to SH movies -despite all the changes they did to the 30s and 40s Basil Rathbone films those were more true to the spirit of SH than the 2009 film, as are the latest BBC TV shows putting Holmes in the present. I, and I gather a lot of people, consider the older BBC series which starred Jeremy Brett to be the best film adaptations ever, largely because we think he is the best Holmes ever.\n\nSo here's more Sherlock than you can throw a persian slipper at. Light up some shag tobacco in your pipe and read them.\nIf you don't Like Sherlock, go away and stick a hypo of 7% cocaine in your arm. Much more genteel than snorting it, and doesn't wreck your nose. Perfectly legal in Holmes' day. Dr Watson will lecture about it however, and eventually get you off it. So wait till's he's out.\n\nDC\nSherlock Holmes 001  (DC(09-10 1975)\n\nThis is Wildstorm and will have to be included again in the Vs, but is here on a topical basis.
