It is a window into the dark recesses of corruption and government criminality and abuse that have become all too common features of everyday life. It is jam packed with important court documents, trial transcripts, affidavits, expert testimony, photographs and illustrations (including 50 full color evidentiary plates), suspect sketches, FBI and ATF documents, and eyewitnesses statements. It covers all phases of the bombing from the Preliminary Hearing in which the Federal Government submitted its' evidence of other John Doe's who accompanied Timothy McVeigh to the involvement of Middle Eastern terrorists. It is fully indexed and includes an appendix of over 150 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nby Charles Key and the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pdf file is comprised of a paperback copy of the book, pages separated and scanned with a flatbed scanner.
