In the 1970s when Australia was in the midst of a deep recession, a rough and ready pub rock sound emerged, characterised by bands like Rose Tattoo who were promoted by family-run company, Alberts. The raw power and fat guitar sound that characterised Aussie rock was pioneered by the Alberts and took Australia and the world by storm.\r\nThe sound of Aussie rock really exploded when the Alberts, a well-to-do family from the Sydney suburbs, joined forces with the Young's, a Glasgow family who had emigrated to Australia. The result was AC/DC.\r\nThe documentary tells the story of how brothers Angus and Malcolm Young were produced by their older brother George and fellow Easybeats member Harry Vanda. Vanda and Young produced the band at Albert Studios and they were soon joined by the wild and charismatic lead singer Bon Scott.\r\nHead of Alberts was Ted Albert - a quietly confident risk taker. He backed AC/DC for many years with rock-solid conviction when their type of music and fashion seemed completely at odds with a UK and US music scene dominated by punk. Then, in 1980, AC/DC's Back in Black album was a massive success around the world and the rest is history. The film retraces the band's explosion in popularity, the relentless touring and the tragic death of Bon Scott.\r\nEven after Bon's death, and with the addition of Brian Johnson, the band went from strength to strength and remain hugely popular and one of the world's most legendary bands. Today, the Albert family remains a potent force in Australian music.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/The-Easybeats-to-ACDC-The-Story-of-Aussie-Rock-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3005 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0705t5j","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cb4c813eade7b3e7d78f6003db7a27485f6fb6b","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Easybeats+To+ACDC+The+Story+Of+Aussie+Rock+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cb4c813eade7b3e7d78f6003db7a27485f6fb6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,180,200,19,234,222,123,62,125,120,246,0,61,183,162,116,133,246,251,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
