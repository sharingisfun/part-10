A single mother returns from work to find her nine-year-old son gone. She calls the LAPD to initiate a search. Five months later, a boy is found in Illinois who fits the description; he says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her son. To fanfare and photos, the LAPD reunite mother and son, but she insists heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not her boy. The cops dismiss her as either a liar or hysterical. When she joins a minister in his public criticism of the police, they in turn use government power to silence and intimidate her. Meanwhile, a cop goes to a dilapidated ranch to find a Canadian lad whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s without legal status; the youth tells a grisly tale. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s redress for murder; is there redress for abuse of power?\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/\nRelease Date: 31 October 2008 (USA)\nGenre: Drama | History | Mystery\nStars: Angelina Jolie, Colm Feore, Amy Ryan\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-ESiR\nSize: 950MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fb734adf833d741e0ffade47b4e7bda2cf322de","amp;dn":"Changeling+%282008%29+BluRay+720p+950MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fb734adf833d741e0ffade47b4e7bda2cf322de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,183,52,173,248,51,215,65,224,255,173,228,123,78,123,218,44,243,34,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
