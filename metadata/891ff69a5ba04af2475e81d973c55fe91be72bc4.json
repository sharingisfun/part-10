Released in May 1967 on the Vanguard label, it was one of the first psychedelic albums to come out of San Francisco.\n\nTracks from the LP, especially &quot;Section 43&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot;, and &quot;Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine&quot; were played on progressive FM rock stations like KSAN and KMPX in San Francisco, often back-to-back. A version of the song &quot;Love&quot; was performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival.\n\n&quot;Grace&quot; is a tribute to Jefferson Airplane's lead singer, Grace Slick.\n\nThe album was recorded during the first week of February 1967 at Sierra Sound Laboratories, Berkeley, California, by Robert DeSouza, with production by Samuel Charters. It was released on May 11, 1967, on the Vanguard label. \nDue to deterioration of the original master tapes, the album was remixed in 1982 and this remix was used for the original CD release in 1990; in 2013 a new two-disc deluxe version appeared which included both the original mono and stereo mixes. \n\nThe liner notes to the 2013 version state that an outtake from the sessions, &quot;Thought Dream&quot;, was later included on the band's follow-up, I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die.\n\n\nBruce Eder in a retrospective review for AllMusic felt that the album is &quot;one of the most important and enduring documents of the psychedelic era&quot;.\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs by Joe McDonald, except where noted\n\n1. &quot;Flying High&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:38\n2. &quot;Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:21\n3. &quot;Death Sound Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:23\n\n        Labeled as &quot;Death Sound&quot; on the mono version of the album.\n\n4. &quot;Happiness Is a Porpoise Mouth&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n\n        Labeled as &quot;Porpoise Mouth&quot; on the mono version of the album.\n\n5. &quot;Section 43&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:23\n6. &quot;Superbird&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:04\n7. &quot;Sad and Lonely Times&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:23\n8. &quot;Love&quot; (McDonald, Melton, Cohen, Barthol, Gunning, Hirsh) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:19\n9. &quot;Bass Strings&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:58\n10. &quot;The Masked Marauder&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n11. &quot;Grace&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:03\n\nMusicians\n\n    Country Joe McDonald: vocals, guitar, bells, tambourine\n    Barry Melton: vocals, guitar\n    David Cohen: guitar, organ\n    Bruce Barthol: bass, harmonica\n    Gary &quot;Chicken&quot; Hirsh: drums\n\nLets take it back aways, so here is something to melt minds from long ago","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:891ff69a5ba04af2475e81d973c55fe91be72bc4","amp;dn":"Country+Joe+and+the+Fish+-+Electric+Music+For+The+Mind+and+Body","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"891ff69a5ba04af2475e81d973c55fe91be72bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,31,246,154,91,160,74,242,71,94,129,217,115,197,95,233,27,231,43,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
