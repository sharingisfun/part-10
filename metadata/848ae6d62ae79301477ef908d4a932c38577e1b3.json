It is independent, non-partisan, and not affiliated with any organization or think tank.\n\nFounded and produced by Mark Skousen since 2002, FreedomFest invites the &quot;best and the brightest&quot; from around the world to talk, strategize, socialize, and celebrate liberty. FreedomFest is open to all and is purely egalitarian, where speakers, attendees, and exhibitors are treated as equals.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.freedomfest.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.freedomfest.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristopher Hitchens (born 1949) is an author, journalist and literary critic. Currently living in Washington, D.C., he has been a columnist at Vanity Fair, The Atlantic, World Affairs, The Nation, Slate, Free Inquiry, and a variety of other media outlets. Hitchens is also a political observer, whose books ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the latest being &quot;God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ have made him a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits.\n\nIn 2009 Hitchens was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the &quot;25 most influential liberals in U.S. media.&quot; The same article noted, though, that he would &quot;likely be aghast to find himself on this list&quot; and that he &quot;styles himself a radical&quot;, not a liberal.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.hitchensweb.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.hitchensweb.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848ae6d62ae79301477ef908d4a932c38577e1b3","amp;dn":"The+True+Core+Of+The+Jesus+Myth+%7C+Christopher+Hitchens+%40+Freedom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848ae6d62ae79301477ef908d4a932c38577e1b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,138,230,214,42,231,147,1,71,126,249,8,212,169,50,195,133,119,225,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
