The bridgehead provided the shortest route across the river Don\n\tat Malyshevo, terminating in the Southern outskirts of Voronezh on the\n\tright bank of the river. German forces intended to use the right bank\n\tin their drive to Stalingrad. Hitler was later to declare delays\n\tadvancing through this region contributed to the failure at Stalingrad,\n\thaving given Soviet forces more time to prepare. The Shilovo forest\n\tpresented ideal opportunities for the concealed deployment of reserve\n\tforces. It masked warehouses, logistical assets &amp; accommodations.\n\tShilovo, located on high ground, held a dominant position on the left\n\tbank. From the village and especially from the church bell-tower, the\n\tdisposition of Soviet defensive forces at Maslovka, Tavrovo, and\n\tBeryozovka was clearly visible, even without field glasses.\n    In-game engagements are modelled for the period from July 4 to July 6,\n\t1942. The battle (on the map modeled in the game) was fought by:\n\tGerman 24th Pz. Div. (26th Inf. Regt., 24th Inf. Regt.) with\n\treinforcements, and Soviet 232 Rifle Div. (498 Rifle Regt., 425 Art.\n\tRegt.), 110 Tank Bde and a battalion of 180 Tank Bde (last is\n\tunconfirmed). Elements of the 24th Pz. Div. had begun crossing the Don\n\ton the morning of 4th July. Initially only lightly armed units made\n\tthe crossing, moving towards Voronezh. Heavy equipment and artillery\n\tfollowed only on 5th July. On the morning of 5th July the German\n\tforces were unsuccessfully counter-attacked by tanks of 110 and 180\n\tTank Bde. German forces defeated elements of the 232nd Rifle Div. and\n\ttook control of Shilovo. Germans noted the strong influence of Soviet\n\tair support.\n\n\n   - Extract\n   - Burn or mount the .iso\n   - Run setup.exe and install\n   - copy crack from CODEX dir to installdir\n   - Play\n\n   Notes: As the game has achieved a lot of huge and minor updates, almost\n\t\t  all files got updated, so we decided to make and tag release with\n\t\t  the latest DLC released on August, 7, meaning that this release\n\t\t  is STANDALONE edition from Steam.
