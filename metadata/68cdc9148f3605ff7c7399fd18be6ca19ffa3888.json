In this 208 page, full-colour hardback book you will find the saga of Tamurkhan the Maggot Lord, lavishly illustrated and darkly detailed, an extensive bestiary section and a campaign system allowing you to fight the battles of TamurkhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horde in exciting tabletop games of Warhammer. Also contained within is a fully playable Chaos Dwarf army list Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Legion of Azgorh Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as rules for playing massive battles with forces drawn from the different Chaos Army books. In order to use the game content of this book fully, you will need to have copies of the Warhammer rulebook and the Warriors of Chaos and Empire Army books.\nPrinted on high quality paper, which presents the full colour artwork with an amazing depth and richness, each page is embellished with many tiny details, revealing never-before-seen vistas of the landscape and geography of the Warhammer world. The hardback, leather-effect binding, embossed with gold lettering, has been designed to emulate the faded binding of an arcane tome, down to the inclusion of the classic red silk-effect page marker.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68cdc9148f3605ff7c7399fd18be6ca19ffa3888","amp;dn":"Tamurkhan%3A+Throne+of+Chaos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68cdc9148f3605ff7c7399fd18be6ca19ffa3888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,205,201,20,143,54,5,255,124,115,153,253,24,190,108,161,159,250,56,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
