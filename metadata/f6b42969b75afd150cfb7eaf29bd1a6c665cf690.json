In 2002, it's a place where tourists are hacked to death with machetes, 12-year-olds with AK-47s wage war, and celebrities futilely try to get people to care. Moses Lwanga is a pacifist doctor caught at the center. But when his life is threatened, Moses suddenly realizes he knows how to kill all too well. What is this voice telling him the only way to fix what's wrong with the country is by slaughtering those responsible? And what is Moses' connection to another past bandage-wrapped warrior?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b42969b75afd150cfb7eaf29bd1a6c665cf690","amp;dn":"Unknown+Soldier+%282008+Series%29+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b42969b75afd150cfb7eaf29bd1a6c665cf690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,180,41,105,183,90,253,21,12,251,126,175,41,189,26,108,102,92,246,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
