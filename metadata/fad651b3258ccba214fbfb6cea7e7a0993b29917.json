He was the only artist to exhibit at all eight of the Impressionist exhibitions between 1874 and 1886, and his letters are a fascinating and invaluable source of information on the theoretical aspects and practical implications of Impressionism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad651b3258ccba214fbfb6cea7e7a0993b29917","amp;dn":"Pissarro+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad651b3258ccba214fbfb6cea7e7a0993b29917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,214,81,179,37,140,203,162,20,251,251,108,234,126,122,9,147,178,153,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
