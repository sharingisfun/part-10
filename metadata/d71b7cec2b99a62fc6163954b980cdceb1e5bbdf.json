This torrent collects the entire body of work, now know as volume one - issues 01-19 and the Annual. These are presented in digital format, thanks to an unknown scanner group as no credit was listed from the source. Please seed, and enjoy these classics! :-) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71b7cec2b99a62fc6163954b980cdceb1e5bbdf","amp;dn":"The+Eternals+v1+by+Kirby+01-19+%2B+Ann+%281976-1978%7CDigital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71b7cec2b99a62fc6163954b980cdceb1e5bbdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,27,124,236,43,153,166,47,198,22,57,84,185,128,205,206,177,229,187,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
