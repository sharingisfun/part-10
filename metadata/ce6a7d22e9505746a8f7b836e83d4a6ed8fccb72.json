The title refers to the scholar-bureaucrats of imperial China. \n\nThe characters at times see themselves as ineffectual &quot;mandarins&quot; as they attempt to discern what role, if any, intellectuals will have in influencing the political landscape of the world after World War II. \n\nAs in Beauvoir's other works, themes of feminism, existentialism, and personal morality are explored as the characters navigate not only the intellectual and political landscape but also their shifting relationships with each other.\n\nGenre: Fiction | Existentialism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce6a7d22e9505746a8f7b836e83d4a6ed8fccb72","amp;dn":"The+Mandarins+by+Simone+de+Beauvoir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce6a7d22e9505746a8f7b836e83d4a6ed8fccb72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,106,125,34,233,80,87,70,168,247,184,54,232,61,74,110,216,252,203,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
