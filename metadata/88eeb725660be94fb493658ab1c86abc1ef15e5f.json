(RSC, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-84973-811-8\r\n\r\nNanoparticles are attractive for many biomedical applications such as imaging, therapeutics and diagnostics. This new book will look at different soft nanoparticles and their current and potential uses in medicine and health including magnetoliposomes, micro/nanogels, polymeric micelles, DNA particles, dendrimers and bicelles.\r\n\r\nEach chapter will provide a description of the synthesis of the particles and focus on the techniques used to characterize the size, shape, surface charge, internal structure, and surface microstructure of the nanoparticles together with modeling and simulation methods. By giving a strong physical-chemical approach to the topic, readers will gain a good background into the subject and an overview of recent developments.\r\n\r\nThe multidisciplinary point of view makes the book suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in physics, chemistry, and biology interested in soft matter and its uses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88eeb725660be94fb493658ab1c86abc1ef15e5f","amp;dn":"Soft+Nanoparticles+for+Biomedical+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88eeb725660be94fb493658ab1c86abc1ef15e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,238,183,37,102,11,233,79,180,147,101,138,177,200,106,188,30,241,94,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
