The British press and tabloids seemed to focus on her rowdy behavior, heavy consumption of alcohol, and tragic end, but fans and critics alike embraced her rugged charm, brash sense of humor, and distinctively soulful and jazzy vocals. Her platinum-selling breakthrough album, Frank (2003), elicited comparisons ranging from Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan to Macy Gray and Lauryn Hill. Interestingly enough, despite her strong accent and vernacular, one can often hear aspects of each of those singers' vocal repertoire in Winehouse's own voice. Nonetheless, her allure had always been her songwriting -- almost always deeply personal but best known for its profanity and brutal candor.\n\n  Greets\n \n  SmashAndGrab, sundox, HiGH, zombiRG, Murlok","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4d8f4cdf9339b4864a3d9d23f29252013b3b0c","amp;dn":"Amy+Winehouse+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4d8f4cdf9339b4864a3d9d23f29252013b3b0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,77,143,76,223,147,57,180,134,74,61,157,35,242,146,82,1,59,59,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
