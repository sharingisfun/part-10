Barely contained in 4 solidly-packed discs, they've been restored and remastered to their original, anvil-dropping, laughter-inducing glory! It's a one-of-a-kind celebration of the golden age of Warner Bros. animation. One disc focuses on carrot-crunching icon Bugs Bunny, another on the anarchic Daffy Duck and eternal straight man Porky Pig, and the other two showcase the rest of the Looney Tunes gang. Extensively entertaining and encyclopedic extras will make your eyes pop and jaws drop - just like being inside your own Warner Bros. cartoon.
