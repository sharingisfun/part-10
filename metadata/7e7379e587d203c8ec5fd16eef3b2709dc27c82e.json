Basic mathematical theories are explained in the simplest of terms, supported by practical engineering examples and applications from a wide variety of engineering disciplines, to ensure the reader can relate the theory to actual engineering practice. This extensive and thorough topic coverage makes this an ideal text for a range of university degree modules, Foundation Degrees, and HNC/D units.\nAn established text which has helped many thousands of students to gain exam success, now in its fifth edition Higher Engineering Mathematics has been further extended with new topics to maximise the books applicability for first year engineering degree students, and those following Foundation Degrees. New material includes: inequalities; differentiation of parametric equations; differentiation of hyperbolic functions; and homogeneous first order differential equations.\n\nThis book also caters specifically for the engineering mathematics units of the Higher National Engineering schemes from Edexcel, including the core unit Analytical Methods for Engineers, and the two specialist units Further Analytical Methods for Engineers and Engineering Mathematics in their entirety, common to both the electrical/electronic engineering and mechanical engineering pathways. A mapping grid is included showing precisely which topics are required for the learning outcomes of each unit, for ease of reference.\n\nThe book is supported by a suite of free web downloads:\n* Introductory-level algebra: To enable students to revise basic algebra needed for engineering courses.\n* Instructor's Manual: Featuring full worked solutions and mark scheme for all 19 assignments in the book and the remedial algebra assignment. \n* Extensive Solutions Manual: 640 pages featuring worked solutions for 1,000 of the further problems and exercises in the book.\n\n* New edition includes new and extended coverage of additional topics for undergraduate study and Foundation Degree courses\n* Includes over 1,000 worked examples and over 1,750 problems, to enable the student to apply mathematics in real-world engineering contexts\n* An extensive Solutions Manual provides solutions to over 1,000 of the 1,750 further problems and is available as a free download for lecturers ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e7379e587d203c8ec5fd16eef3b2709dc27c82e","amp;dn":"Higher+Engineering+Mathematics+5th+Ed+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e7379e587d203c8ec5fd16eef3b2709dc27c82e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,115,121,229,135,210,3,200,236,95,209,110,239,59,39,9,220,39,200,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
