The results of this research are dispersed in the technical literature among journal articles and abstracts of conferences. Consequently, the information is not readily available to researchers and practicing engineers in the power device community. There is no cohesive treatment of the ideas to provide an assessment of the relative merits of the ideas.\n&quot;Advanced Power MOSFET Concepts&quot; provides an in-depth treatment of the physics of operation of advanced power MOSFETs. Analytical models for explaining the operation of all the advanced power MOSFETs will be developed. The results of numerical simulations will be provided to give additional insight into the device physics and validate the analytical models. The results of two-dimensional simulations will be provided to corroborate the analytical models and give greater insight into the device operation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af7d146b92d164e5e1452bca85a35ab59196c6c8","amp;dn":"Advanced+Power+MOSFET+Concepts+%282011%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af7d146b92d164e5e1452bca85a35ab59196c6c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,125,20,107,146,209,100,229,225,69,43,202,133,163,90,181,145,150,198,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
