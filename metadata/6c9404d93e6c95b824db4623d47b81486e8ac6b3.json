Every essential skill required to build Windows desktop-style applications is covered in the context of fully working examples.\n\nThe book begins with a quick primer on the C++ language, and using the Visual C++ IDE to create Windows applications. This acts as a recap for existing C++ programmers, and a quick guide to the language if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve not worked with C++ before. The book then moves into a set of comprehensive example applications, presenting the important parts of the code with explanation of how it works, and how and when to use similar techniques in your own applications.\n\nThe applications include: a Tetris-style game, a drawing application, a spreadsheet, and a word processor.\n\nIf you know the C++ language, or another Windows-based programming language, and want to use C++ to write real, complex applications then this book is ideal for you.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c9404d93e6c95b824db4623d47b81486e8ac6b3","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Visual+C%2B%2B+Windows+Applications+by+Examples%2C2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c9404d93e6c95b824db4623d47b81486e8ac6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,148,4,217,62,108,149,184,36,219,70,35,212,123,129,72,110,138,198,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
