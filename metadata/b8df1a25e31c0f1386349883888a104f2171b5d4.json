The band had relocated to London by 1970, and they released their self-titled debut album in 1971. Both Nazareth and 1972's Exercises received favorable attention by British hard rockers, but it was 1973's Razamanaz that moved them into the U.K. Top Ten (both &quot;Broken Down Angel&quot; and &quot;Bad Bad Boy&quot; were hit singles). Loud 'n' Proud and Rampant (both 1974) followed the same formula, yet were slightly less successful.\n\n\nArtist...............: Nazareth\nAlbum................: Star Mark Greatest Hits\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2010\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/14/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front, Back\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1\n\n01.Razamanaz\n02.Bad Bad Boy\n03.Morning Dew\n04.Go Down Fighting\n05.Love Hurts\n06.Shanghai'd In Shanghai\n07.Teenage Nervous Breakdown\n08.Dream On\n09.Hair Of The Dog\n10.Holy Roller\n11.Carry Out Feelings\n12.Telegram\n13.Expect No Mercy\n14.Gone Dead Train\n15.Place In Your Heart\n16.May The Sunshine\n17.Holiday\n18.Every Young Man's Dream\n19.Love Leads To Madness\n20.Ruby Tuesday\n21.Animals\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Broken Down Angel\n02.This Flight Tonight\n03.My White Bicycle\n04.Woke Up This Morning\n05.Turn On Your Receiver\n06.You're The Violin\n07.I Don't Want To Go On Without You\n08.No Mean City\n09.Whatever You Want Babe\n10.Star\n11.Heart's Grown Cold\n12.Dressed To Kill\n13.Moonlight Eyes\n14.Little Part Of You\n15.Where Are You Now\n16.Piece Of My Heart\n17.Winner Of The Night\n18.Every Time It Rains\n19.Steamroller\n20.When The Lights Come Down\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8df1a25e31c0f1386349883888a104f2171b5d4","amp;dn":"Nazareth+-+Star+Mark+Greatest+Hits+%282010%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8df1a25e31c0f1386349883888a104f2171b5d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,223,26,37,227,28,15,19,134,52,152,131,136,138,16,79,33,113,181,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
