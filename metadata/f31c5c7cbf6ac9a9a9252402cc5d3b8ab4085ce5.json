Now with just one virtual instrument you can infuse some humor into your music, mock the brass trumpet, confuse your family and friends, all while enjoying strange animation on the main page of the interface\nMouth trumpet is a vocal technique that imitates the sound of the trumpet.\nThe mouth trumpet sound is produced by using the vocal cords to produce the desired pitch and passing the sound through the lips that are held together with just enough tension so that they vibrate at the same frequency as the vocal cords, producing a trumpet-like sound.\n----------\nThis instrument is smooth, quirky, and we know you'll have a ball with it. Oh - and along with Mouth Trumpet, we made a bunch of fun FX patches that we think you'll love...
