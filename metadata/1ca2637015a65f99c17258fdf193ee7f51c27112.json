What we eat, how we eat, are and always have been fundamental to the structuring of social life, both in the past and in the present. The remains of food are also among the most common archaeological finds. The papers in this volume explore and develop ways of using food to write social history; they move beyond taphonomic and economic properties of 'subsistence resources' to examine the social background and cultural contexts of food preparation and consumption. Contributions break new ground in method and interpretation in case studies spanning the Palaeolithic to the Present, and from the Amazon to the Arctic. This volume will thus be essential reading for all archaeologists, anthropologists and social historians interested in the prehistory and history of food consumption.\n=====================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca2637015a65f99c17258fdf193ee7f51c27112","amp;dn":"Preston+Miracle+-+Consuming+Passions+and+Patterns+of+Consumption","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca2637015a65f99c17258fdf193ee7f51c27112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,162,99,112,21,166,95,153,193,114,88,253,241,147,238,127,81,194,113,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
