Born in Hungary in 1905, a defector from the Communist Party in 1938, and then arrested in both Spain and France for his political views, Arthur Koestler writes from a wealth of personal experience. \n  Imprisoned by the political party to which he has dedicated his life, Nicolas Rubashov paces his prison cell, examining his life and remembering his tempestuous career. As the old intelligentsia is eradicated to make way for the new, he is psychologically tortured and forced to confess to preposterous crimes. Comparing himself to Moses, led to the Promised Land but refused entry, he sees only darkness at the end of his life where once he saw such promise for humanity. \n  Frank MullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narrative expertise is perfect for this haunting work. RubashovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal agony becomes MullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as he presents KoestlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relevant and important questions to a world entering a new millennium.\n - - -\n\n  Darkness At Noon stands as an unequaled fictional portrayal of the nightmare politics of our time. Its hero is an aging revolutionary, imprisoned and psychologically tortured by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he re-lives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and human betrayals of a totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Almost unbearably vivid in its depiction of one man's solitary agony,   Darkness At Noon asks questions about ends and means that have relevance not only for the past but for the perilous present. It is-as the Times Literary Supplement has declared-&quot;A remarkable book, a grimly fascinating interpretation of the logic of the Russian Revolution, indeed of all revolutionary dictatorships, and at the same time a tense and subtly intellectualized drama...&quot;\n - - -\n\n  It is the sort of novel that transcends ordinary limitations, and that may be read as a primary discourse in political philosophy. It is a far cry from the bleak topical commmentaries that sometimes pass as novels. The magic effect of Darkness at Noon is its magnificant tragic irony.\n  -Books of the Century; New York Times review, May 1941\n - - -\n\n  From Wiki:\n \n  Darkness at Noon was probably the most influential anti-Communist book ever written. Its influence in Europe on Communists and sympathisers and, indirectly, on the outcomes of elected governments, was substantial.\n\n  The devastating anti-Communist novel, Darkness at Noon, propelled him to instant international fame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82c15bd9480ac4d2b9057c891f81bac926eb6dca","amp;dn":"DARKNESS+AT+NOON+-+Arthur+Koestler.+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82c15bd9480ac4d2b9057c891f81bac926eb6dca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,193,91,217,72,10,196,210,185,5,124,137,31,129,186,201,38,235,109,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
