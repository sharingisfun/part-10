Six years alone. Six years keeping his mouth shut about the robbery, about the other men involved. The night he is released, the four men he protected with silence celebrate his freedom with a congratulatory dinner. The meal is a lavish array of sushi, served off the naked body of a beautiful young woman. The sushi girl seems catatonic, trained to ignore everything in the room, even if things become dangerous. Sure enough, the four unwieldy thieves cant help but open old wounds in an attempt to find their missing loot.\n \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606339/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606339/&lt;/a&gt;\n \nGenre: Crime | Thriller\n iMDB Rating: 5,7/10 from 804 users\n Director: Kern Saxton\n Starring: Tony Todd, James Duval and Noah Hathaway\n \nLength: 01:38:57\n Video info: H264, 915 kbps,, 1000 fps\n Audio info: AAC , 150 kbps , 48000 Hz\n \nSource Used: Sushi Girl 2012 720p BluRay X264-LCHD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e4e70d4552f4f74a16368d14ea0e9eed4c13137","amp;dn":"Sushi+Girl+2012+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e4e70d4552f4f74a16368d14ea0e9eed4c13137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,78,112,212,85,47,79,116,161,99,104,209,78,160,233,238,212,193,49,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
