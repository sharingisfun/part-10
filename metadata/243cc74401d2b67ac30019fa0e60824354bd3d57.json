Adobe Premiere Pro CC works natively with the video formats you want and accelerate production from scriptwriting to editing, encoding, and final delivery.\n\nSave time with industry-leading native tapeless workflows, which eliminate transcoding and rewrapping, while preserving the pristine quality of your footage. Adobe Premiere Pro CC captures and logs footage from virtually any camera. Import and export Apple Final Cut Pro and Avid projects in Adobe Premiere Pro CC so you can explore new possibilities with After Effects, Photoshop, and other Adobe software, bringing timesaving integration between Adobe tools to projects created in these other NLEs.\n\nFeatures :\nLive Text templates\nModify the text in After Effects compositions without leaving Premiere Pro. (Requires 2014 release of After Effects.)\n\nMasking and tracking\nCreate feathered masks that obscure or highlight objects by following their movement across frames. Send masks to After Effects via Dynamic Link to access more advanced tracking features.\n\nMaster clip effects\nWhen you apply effects to a master clip, the changes ripple down through every part of that clip in your sequence.\n\nEnhanced graphics performance in Mercury Playback Engine\nWork faster thanks to OpenCL workflow improvements, a GPU debayer for RED media, and new support for Intel Iris.\n\nFaster editing workflow\nGet better handling of large projects plus faster sorting and searching in the Project panel. Multiple new editing features respond to key customer requests like reverse match frame and volume keyframe nudge.\n\nNew delivery formats\nExport to industry-standard AS11 for broadcast and Digital Cinema Package (DCP) for screening rooms. Both formats include associated metadata. Also, export stereo audio to Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus.\n\nTypekit integration\nBrowse fonts from Typekit from the Title menu and download them for use in your projects.\n\nAutoSave to Cloud\nAutomatically back up your Premiere Pro projects to Adobe Creative Cloud.\n\nNew native format support\nGet built-in support for the ARRI AMIRA camera, with appropriate color LUTs applied as master clips on import.
