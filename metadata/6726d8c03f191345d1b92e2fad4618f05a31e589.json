As a result, architects and designers are pushing the boundaries to make best use of the available space. In this book, we take a look at some of these solutions and help you to think outside the square, to create a house that is both aesthetically pleasing and practical for modern living.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6726d8c03f191345d1b92e2fad4618f05a31e589","amp;dn":"Houses+For+Small+Spaces+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6726d8c03f191345d1b92e2fad4618f05a31e589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,38,216,192,63,25,19,69,209,185,46,47,173,70,24,240,90,49,229,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
