Taj Mahal has always made homage to Mrs. Etta Baker by performing her music. He explains, &quot;That chord in Railroad Bill is a very ancient root chord; it strikes straight through me, every time I hear it played.&quot;\n\nEtta Baker of Morganton, NC, was born in 1913 and played the guitar since the age of 3. She was the premier female Piedmont blues guitar instrumentalist, played the guitar everyday,and was constantly working on new arrangements. Etta maintained a beautiful yard and garden, and was matriarch of 108 members in her immediate family. Taj Mahal has been a major recording artist since his debut album in 1967. For 35 years, he has been a tireless preacher of American roots music.\n\nNOW\n\n1 John Henry - Etta Baker &amp;Taj Mahal - 3:41\n2 Crow Jane - Etta Baker &amp;Taj Mahal - 2:20\n3 Going Down the Road Feeling Bad - Etta Baker &amp;Taj Mahal - 2:46\n4 Madison Street Blues - Etta Baker &amp;Taj Mahal - 2:50\n5 Railroad Bill - Etta Baker &amp;Taj Mahal - 3:18\n6 Cripple Creek - Etta Baker - 1:39\n7 Johnson Boys - Etta Baker &amp;Wayne Martin - 1:52\n8 Going to the Race Track - Etta Baker - :32\n9 Lost John - Etta Baker - 1:58\n10 Dew Drop - Etta Baker - 2:20\n11 Poem - Etta Baker - :21\n12 Comb Blues - Etta Baker, Algia Mae Hinton &amp;Taj Mahal - 5:03\n\nTHEN\n\n13 -One Dime Blues - Etta Baker - 2:57\n14 - Sourwood Mountain - Mr. Boone Reid - 1:48\n15 - DonÃƒÂ¢??t Let Your Deal Go Down - Etta Baker - 1:22\n16- Railroad Bill - Etta Baker - 2:35\n17 - Johnson Boys - Mr. Boone Reid - 1:25\n18 - John Henry - Etta Baker - 2:36\n19 - Bully of the Town - Etta Baker - 2:58","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c17f9691ce0da43eade42fe7191b3726fd5205","amp;dn":"Etta+Baker+With+Taj+Mahal+%5B2004%5D+-+Blues+-+Acoustic+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c17f9691ce0da43eade42fe7191b3726fd5205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,193,127,150,145,206,13,164,62,173,228,47,231,25,27,55,38,253,82,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
