The twenty tracks date from 1955 and are some of his earliest national recordings. These were all recorded for the Los Angeles-based Specialty label, and came after previous records on regional based outfits in his Bayou homeland of Louisiana and Gulf Coast Texas. It\\'s easy to see why there was interest in presenting him to a wider audience, as these largely blues-based songs are both invitingly friendly and irresistibly danceable. His band was well seasoned from constant road work and the recordings capture the warm and intuitive interplay. rhythmically dynamic, one of their secret weapons was the scrub board playing of Clifton\\'s brother Cleveland.\n\n\nTracklist\n01 BoppinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ The Rock\n02 Ay-Te Te Fee\n03 The Cats DreaminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n04 Squeeze Box Boogie\n05 The Things I Did For You\n06 Think It Over\n07 Zodico Stomp\n08 Yesterday (I Lost My Best Friend)\n09 ChenierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Boogie\n10 IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m On My Way (Back Home To You)\n11 All Night Long\n12 Opelousas Hop\n13 IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m On My Way (Back Home To You)\n14 Wherever You Go IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Go\n15 Opelousas Hop\n16 CliftonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DreaminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n17 ChenierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Boogie\n18 Wherever You Go IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Go\n19 Ay-Te Te Fee\n20 All Night Long\n\n\nPrincipally recorded at Master Recorders and Ted Brinson\\'s Studio, Los Angeles, California between April and September 9, 1955. \n\nPersonnel: Clifton Chenier (vocals, accordion); Phillip Walker, Lonesome Sundown (guitar); Lionel Prevo (tenor saxophone); James K.
