This torrent contains a complete set of all the stories involving the Marvel Comics super hero team Excalibur that were published during the time period covered in Excalibur v1.\n\nExcalibur is a Marvel Comics superhero group, an offshoot of the X-Men, usually based in the United Kingdom. Conceived by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer Alan Davis, the original Excalibur first appeared in Excalibur: The Sword is Drawn (1987).\n\nThe first Excalibur consisted of the British superhero Captain Britain, his lover Meggan, and several onetime members of the X-Men and related mutant teams. An eponymous series featuring the team lasted from 1988 until 1998. Originally, it was a wacky series involving cross-dimensional travel that incorporated as many elements of Captain Britain?s mythos as it did the X-Men?s. It became a more typical X-Book in later years.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.
