Nicky Mehta, Ruth Moody, and Heather Masse, the latter of whom took over for Annabelle Chvostek in 2007, sing like siblings and play like seasoned veterans, resulting in a seamless, understated sound that feels both perennial and distinctly Canadian. Lonesome and surprisingly comforting, the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fourth studio album, Bright Morning Stars, offers up 13 meditations on love, life, and loss that fit right in with the trioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s penchant for melding traditional folk songs and sea shanteys with contemporary themes. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a quiet but powerful collection of snowbound balladry that may be too subtle and unassuming for 21st century attention spans, which is a large part of its charm. Comparisons to Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch are apt, but the Jennys' ability to harmonize like the family acts of old sets them apart from many of their contemporaries. Part Watersons and part Fleetwood Mac, songs like the pop-driven ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSwing Low Sail High,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the jazzy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMona Louise,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the timeless sounding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBird Song,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the sparse, largely a cappella title cut, feel grounded and effortless, despite their competing genres. \n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/the-wailin-jennys/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/the-wailin-jennys/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a06b9ec404af5cdf1be5786992f3af2164c66b4","amp;dn":"The+Wailin%5C%27+Jennys...Bright+Morning+Stars%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a06b9ec404af5cdf1be5786992f3af2164c66b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,6,185,236,64,74,245,205,241,190,87,134,153,47,58,242,22,76,102,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
