Nahin\nSeries: Science and Fiction\nCategory: Academic/Religion/Science Fiction\nPublisher: Springer; 2014 edition (April 30, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1493906178\nISBN-13: 978-1493906178\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - &quot;Can a computer have a soul? Are religion and science mutually exclusive? Is there really such a thing as free will? If you could time travel to visit Jesus, would you (and should you)? For hundreds of years, philosophers, scientists and science fiction writers have pondered these questions and many more.\n\nIn Holy Sci-Fi!, popular writer Paul Nahin explores the fertile and sometimes uneasy relationship between science fiction and religion. With a scope spanning the history of religion, philosophy and literature, Nahin follows religious themes in science fiction from Feynman to Foucault and from Asimov to Aristotle.\n\nAn intriguing journey through popular and well-loved books and stories, Holy Sci-Fi! shows how sci-fi has informed humanity's attitudes towards our faiths, our future and ourselves.&quot;\n\nThis torrent contains a fully indexed, browse-able and searchable copy of the book in PDF form.

Please seed, and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f4148403bec32bba46354bc8c2a420636716d8","amp;dn":"Holy+Sci-Fi%21+-+Where+Science+Fiction+and+Religion+Intersect+%28201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f4148403bec32bba46354bc8c2a420636716d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,244,20,132,3,190,195,43,186,70,53,75,200,194,164,32,99,103,22,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
