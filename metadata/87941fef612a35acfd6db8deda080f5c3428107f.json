From there, we'll learn how to edit animation from 3ds Max's Track Bar and Curve Editor.\n\nWe'll learn how to animate objects along a path, how to work non-destructively with animation layers, how to animate with the constraints, plus we'll learn how to transfer animation between characters. We'll even have a look at Populate: 3ds Max's intuitive crowd tool.\n\nBy the end of this training, you'll have the understanding you need to animate comfortably inside of 3ds Max.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87941fef612a35acfd6db8deda080f5c3428107f","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Animation+in+3ds+Max+2015+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87941fef612a35acfd6db8deda080f5c3428107f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,148,31,239,97,42,53,172,253,109,184,222,218,8,15,92,52,40,16,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
