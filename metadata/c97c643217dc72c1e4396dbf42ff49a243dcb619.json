Instead, he finds himself leading the death metal band Detroit Metal City, or DMC, as the costumed and grotesquely made-up &quot;demon emperor&quot; Johannes Krauser II. Although he hates the role and the things he has to do as a member of the band, he has a definite talent for it. Adapted from the hit Japanese comic book by Kiminori Wakasugi, the movie follows Negishi's antics as he tries to reconcile the two very different sides of his life and find out what it really means to achieve his dream.\n      \nYear: 2008\nDirected:   Toshio Lee\nGenre:      Drama/Music\nRuntime:    103 mins\nCountry:    Japan\nLanguage:   Japanese\nSubtitles:  Japanese/ English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup/Ripper:  CiELO\nvideo:         XViD 812 kbps\naudio:         MP3 VBR 128 kbps\nframe rate:    23.976 fps\nresolution:    624 x 336\n\n\n\nHuge thanks to Shadowlord(666) for the subs.\n\n\n\n          ** If you like a screenshot based moviequiz = Please visit **\n                  \n                ** &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=9004&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=9004&lt;/a&gt;  **\n\n\n           ** my uploads &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=16588&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=16588&lt;/a&gt; **\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c97c643217dc72c1e4396dbf42ff49a243dcb619","amp;dn":"Detroit+Metal+City+-+2008+-+DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c97c643217dc72c1e4396dbf42ff49a243dcb619","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,124,100,50,23,220,114,193,228,57,109,191,66,255,73,162,67,220,182,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
