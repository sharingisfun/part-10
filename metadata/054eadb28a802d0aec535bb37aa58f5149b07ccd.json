Like many others, they passed down recollections of history and conveyed religious ideas orally, developing a strong mythological and folkloric tradition through the generations. Christianity brought literacy to the Celts, and converts who became Christian monks wrote down many of the old stories, recording them in several languages, including Irish, Welsh, and Latin. These stories provide a rich, panoramic view of Celtic culture.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore is a fascinating reference to the myths and folklore originating from the people of the Celtic landsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ireland, Scotland, Celtic Britain, Wales, Brittany and central France, Galicia, and the smaller islands where the Celts lived. This accessible book offers a broad overview of the elements that constitute and characterize Celtic mythology and folklore, including figures, deities, events, stories, and places. Concise A-to-Z entries provide brief descriptions of the subjects, emphasizing the original sources of myths and traditions and including bibliographic references.\n\nThe encyclopedia is a valuable asset anywhere myths, legends, folklore, and Irish culture and history are popular.\n\nApproximately 1,000 entries cover:\n\n    * Heroic figures\n    * Historical places\n    * Mythic figures\n    * Narrative and epic cycles\n    * Sacred places and objects\n    * Themes and religious concepts\n    * Theories and controversies\n    * and more.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author(s)\n\nPatricia Monaghan, a member of the interdisciplinary faculty at DePaul University in Chicago, is the author of The Red-Haired Girl from the Bog: The Landscape of Celtic Myth and Spirit and of the forthcoming Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines.
