Hidden from massacres and looting, a strange meeting is held by nine families who share the Roman Empire. To retain their power, they decide to support a new religionÃ¢â‚¬â€ChristianityÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as its representative, the pope.\nBut who are these 9 mysterious families? Later, much later, it's the Renaissance. Christianity prospers. A brigand called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the ScorpionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ makes a living by unearthing relics in the depths of the Roman catacombs, which he sells at high prices to princes and bishops.\n\nVol1: The Mark of the Devil &amp; The Pope's Secret (2008)\nVol2: The Stone Cross &amp; The Devil In the Vatican\nVol3: The Holy Valley\nVol4: The Treasure of the Templars\nVol5: In the Name of the Father\nVol6: The Angel's Shadow\nVol7: The Mask of Truth\n\nBought and ripped: DivideBy0Comics ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34bc1eac5199de3483aba0e6859d856c562c4c94","amp;dn":"%5BCinebook%5D+The+Scorpion+Vol+1-7+ENG+Comic+BD+crop++%28DivideBy0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34bc1eac5199de3483aba0e6859d856c562c4c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,188,30,172,81,153,222,52,131,171,160,230,133,157,133,108,86,44,76,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
