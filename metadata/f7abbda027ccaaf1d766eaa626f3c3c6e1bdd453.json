I have\nto admit however that I sort of downloaded these 7GB and a half for only one\nsong, which happens to be Gary Moore's version of Jimi Hendrix' Red house, which\nhappens to be f*cking brilliant (look it up at&quot;Gary Moore Red House&quot;,\nfirst hit). Besides Gary Moore and some other great artists there are really\nHORRIBLE performers on this DVD so beware! (well, at least the performance of\nsome is really bad, I guess they have proven them selfs in the past.)\n\nThe first intention was to transcode it to xvid4 because there was some kind of\ndemand for it, but after 44 hours of transcoding on a 450MHz P3 (best I got :p )\nthe audio turned out to be out of sync and the interlacing was just... well...\nvery much there. I threw it away, ripped the audio track and encoded it to mp3,\nLAME style!\n\nInfo below from Wikipedia.org:\n\nThe Strat Pack: Live in Concert was a film by Joe Walsh, David Gilmour,\nBrian May and many more about the concert from the 50th Anniversary of the\nFender Stratocaster guitar, released in 2005 and recorded on September 24, 2004.\n\nPerformers:\nJoe Walsh: Guitar, vocals.\nDavid Gilmour: Guitar, vocals.\nBrian May: Guitar, vocals.\nPaul Rodgers: Guitar, vocals.\nRonnie Wood: Guitar, vocals.\nHank Marvin: Guitar, vocals.\nThe Crickets: Guitar, vocals.\nAlbert Lee: Guitar, vocals.\nGary Moore: Guitar, vocals.\nMike Rutherford: Guitar, vocals.\nPaul Carrack: Guitar, vocals.\nPhil Manzanera: Guitar, vocals.\nAmy Winehouse: Guitar, vocals.\nJamie Cullum: Guitar, vocals.\nTheresa Anderson: Guitar, vocals.\nPhil Palmer: Guitar, backing vocals.\nAndy Fairweather-Low: Guitar, backing vocals.\nPino Palladino: Bass guitar, backing vocals.\nPaul &quot;Wix&quot; Wickens: Keyboards.\nIan Thomas: Drums &amp; percussion.\n\n#EOACK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7abbda027ccaaf1d766eaa626f3c3c6e1bdd453","amp;dn":"The+Strat+Pack%3A+Live+in+Concert+-+mp3+192kBit%2Fs+by+ACK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7abbda027ccaaf1d766eaa626f3c3c6e1bdd453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,171,189,160,39,204,170,241,215,102,234,166,38,243,195,198,225,189,212,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
