Of course not as good as or even close to today's &quot;meuzik&quot; of great entertainers such as Miley Cyres, johans brothers, Rihanna and so on. May God have mercy on us! \n\nPart 42 brings you the music of:\n\n\nArmoury Show - Waiting for the Floods [1985]\n\nI Can Crawl - Desert (1986)\n\nSad Lovers and Giants - Feeding the Flame [1983]\n\nVenus in Furs - Platonic Love &amp; Other Stories [1984]\n\n\nBy the way I test-downloaded many of my torrents the other day and wanted to thank all of you who are still seeding those older torrents. Let this music be heard and re-discovered, though quarter a century late. Much appreciated!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c27ace21061b0f0089780d37babc96ba01a05dc","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+42%5D+New+Wave%2C+Post-Punk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c27ace21061b0f0089780d37babc96ba01a05dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,39,172,226,16,97,176,240,8,151,128,211,123,171,201,107,160,26,5,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
