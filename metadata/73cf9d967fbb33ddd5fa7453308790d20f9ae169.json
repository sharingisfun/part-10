Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of those he treated in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s theory, known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;meaning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;), holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.\n\n     Born in 1905, Viktor E. Frankl received the degrees of Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Vienna. During World War II he spent three years at Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps.\n\n     Through four decades Dr. Frankl made innumerable lecture tours throughout the world. He received honorary degrees from 29 universities in Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia. He held numerous awards, among them the Oskar Pfister Award of the American Psychiatric Association and an Honorary Membership of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. \n\nViktor Frankl died 1997 in Vienna.\n\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73cf9d967fbb33ddd5fa7453308790d20f9ae169","amp;dn":"Viktor+E.+Frankl+-+Man%5C%27s+Search+for+Meaning+%28audiobook%29+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73cf9d967fbb33ddd5fa7453308790d20f9ae169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,207,157,150,127,187,51,221,213,250,116,83,48,135,144,210,15,154,225,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
