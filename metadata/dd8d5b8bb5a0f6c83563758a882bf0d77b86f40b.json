Powered by fuel-efficient turbofan engines, the aircraft went through a long and varied evolutionary process, emerging as perhaps the finest long-range interdictor of the 1980s. It served in many roles, flying thousands of combat sorties, and carried a vast array of weaponry, including nuclear payloads, missiles, and bombs. It could also pack a Vulcan cannon. Total stores amounted to 31,500 pounds for any one mission, plus fuel and crew. The last operational F-111's were retired in 2011 by the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nFeatures\n\n    Includes FIVE physically distinct F-111 variants with ELEVEN unique stores loadouts.\n    Featured variants : FB-111A, F-111C, F-111E, F-111F, F-111G and the EF-111A Raven.\n\nELEVEN variants :\n\n1.
