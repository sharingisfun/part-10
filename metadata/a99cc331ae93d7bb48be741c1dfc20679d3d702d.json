Man isn't in a class with either his classic albums of the '70s or his superb comeback album of 1994, The Icon Is Love, but is a likeable and decent (though not outstanding) effort demonstrating that he hadn't lost his touch as a vocalist, composer or producer. With the black music charts dominated by rap and new jack swing in 1989, White remained artistically viable not by emulating the aggression of younger artists (many of whom were sampling his '70s hits left and right), but by being true to himself. Though White goes for a more high-tech, urban-contemporary-influenced production style that's indeed a departure from his lavish orchestral approach of the '70s, noteworthy cuts like the addictive &quot;L.A. My Kinda Place,&quot; the plea for unity &quot;Follow That and See (Where It Leads Y'all)&quot; and an inspired remake of the doo-wop classic &quot;Goodnight My Love&quot; are essentially the type of smooth, classy and sophisticated &quot;uptown soul music&quot; that put him on the map. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a99cc331ae93d7bb48be741c1dfc20679d3d702d","amp;dn":"Barry+White+-+The+Man+Is+Back%21%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a99cc331ae93d7bb48be741c1dfc20679d3d702d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,156,195,49,174,147,215,187,72,190,116,28,29,252,32,103,157,61,112,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
