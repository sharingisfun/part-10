You're in the Pepsi Generation!&quot;  Or so claimed Pepsi-Cola back in 1966.  Their television advertisements featured a catchy number called &quot;Music to Watch Girls By&quot; that Bob Crewe turned into his first top 40 hit, the instrumental piece going to number 15 in 1967.  The 45 single release was monophonic with &quot;Girls on the Rocks&quot; the B side.  Their LP, &quot;Music to Watch Girls By&quot; featured stereo versions of both songs.\n\nThe full title of this CD is &quot;The Best of the Bob Crew Generation: Music to Watch Girls By.&quot;  Among its 19 tracks are all of the songs from the original &quot;Music to Watch Girls By&quot; album except one.  Inexplicably, &quot;Girls on the Rocks&quot; is not included.  Why the producers would leave out &quot;Girls on the Rocks&quot; in favor of a monophonic version of &quot;Music to Watch Girls By&quot; is beyond me, but we're stuck with their decision.  I was able to find &quot;Girls on the Rocks&quot; on an &quot;Oldies but Goodies&quot; album but alas, it was the mono version, and badly recorded at that.\n\n1.
