Its handy intuitive Migrate OS to SSD wizard performs fast and safe Windows migrations to new storage devices (HDD or SSD) and even downsizes to smaller capacity drives.\n\nMove to 3TB drive\n\nTraditional MBR partitioning schemes do not work with HDD bigger than 2.2TB. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why, Paragon Software has developed a workaround method for MBR OS migration to Retained GPT (also known as Hybrid GPT) drives. Drive Copy 11 allows you to use 100% of high-capacity drives. Click here to know how.\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nRun Setup.exe\n\nTo Install Paragon Drive Copy 11 Pro Special Edition\n\nWhen.
