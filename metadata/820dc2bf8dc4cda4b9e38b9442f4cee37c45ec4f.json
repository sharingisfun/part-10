D. Livingston's signature wit and wisdom, Chili provides a wealth of recipes, expertise, and outspoken opinion on making the best, most bodacious bowl of red. A chili-head's delight, this book wrestles with the chili arguments that rage in cookoffs and home kitchens country-wide--with beans or without, tomatoes yes or no, ground meat or cubed, and more. Recipes include chili made with beef, pork, venison, fowl, elk, bison, and &quot;what-ya-got?&quot;; also jerky chili for camp or trail; chili dogs; regional renditions, and more. Whether you're in the mood for Crock-Pot Chili Con Carne, Easy Deer Camp Chili, Chili Meatloaf, or A.D.'s Jerky Chili, you're in for a treat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820dc2bf8dc4cda4b9e38b9442f4cee37c45ec4f","amp;dn":"Chili+-+Recipes+for+a+Bodacious+Bowl+of+Red+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820dc2bf8dc4cda4b9e38b9442f4cee37c45ec4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,13,194,191,141,196,205,164,185,227,139,148,66,244,206,227,124,69,236,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
