Mumbling through \\&quot;Sh-Boom,\\&quot; Freberg drags \\&quot;The Great Pretender\\&quot; snarling to \\&quot;The Heartbreak Hotel,\\&quot; snares \\&quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas,\\&quot; and takes Harry Belafonte\\'s famous \\&quot;Banana Boat\\&quot; sniffling down Lonnie Donnegan\\'s \\&quot;Rock Island Line.\\&quot; Along the way, he reveals Little Red Riding Hood\\'s true colors, turns Chicken Little over to a shrink, arrests a dragon for overacting (a \\&quot;dragonet\\&quot; -- get it?! Duuumb da-dumb dumb!), and puts Ebeneezer Scrooge in the modern-day business world (not a far stretch!). Musical? Maybe. Funny? Definitely! ~ Matthew Robinson\n\nIncludes liner notes by Steve Kolanjian &amp; Stan Freberg.\n\nPersonnel: Peter Leeds (vocals); Red Roundtree, Dick Roberts (banjo); Nariz Grande (trumpet); Buddy Cole (piano).\n\nLiner Note Author: Stan Freberg.\n\n01.
