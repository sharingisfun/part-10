Or he used to be, anyway. As an ex-Army Ranger, Gabe never thought he needed anyone. But after one horrible night in Afghanistan scars him in a way that he can't get past, he needs someone who can help him heal...even if he doesn't realize it.\n25-year old Madison Hill doesn't need anybody...or so she thinks. She grew up watching her parents' messed-up abusive relationship and she knows there's no way in hell that she's ever letting that happen to her.\nThey don't know it in the beginning, but Gabriel and Madison will soon develop a weakness: Each other.\nBut Gabriel's got a secret, a hidden monster that he's afraid Maddy could never overcome... And Maddy's got issues that she's afraid Gabe will never understand. They quickly realize that they need each other to be whole, but at the same time they know that they've got demons to fight.\nAnd the problem with demons is that they never die quietly.\n\nUntil We Burn\nDominic Kinkaide does bad, bad things.\nAs a 24-year old actor with the world on a string, not many women tell Dominic no. In a life where no doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exist, he stretches the boundaries between what is right, what is wrong and what is downright depraved. Dark and damaged, Dom wants no commitments.\nHe wants no attachments.\nHe only wants to disappear into the taboo, into a place where he feels something.\nAnything.\nBut when the aching need to disappear into the darkness is the only thing he has left, Dominic flounders. In a world that is hollow and sexual, without a guiding light or a reason to breathe, Dominic is lost and broken. He knows heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never be fixed. So he makes a decision.\nIf heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to hell, he might as well make it worth it.\nUNTIL WE BURN is a novella (book 2.5 in the Beautifully Broken series) intended to introduce Dominic Kinkaide, to enhance the reading experience of BEFORE WE FALL (Book 3).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:839ef0e280efc6ca0f480ed2d1f975ccbeccbba0","amp;dn":"Beautifully+Broken+Series+by+Courtney+Cole+%28Books+2+%26amp%3B+2.5%29+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"839ef0e280efc6ca0f480ed2d1f975ccbeccbba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,158,240,226,128,239,198,202,15,72,14,210,209,249,117,204,190,204,187,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
