As usual the judges are assisted by industry experts - Simon by One Direction heart-throb Louis Tomlinson, Cheryl by chart star Jess Glynne, Rita by US sensation Meghan Trainor and Nick by leading producer Mark Ronson. However, unlike in previous years, the hopefuls don't get the news straightaway. Instead they have had to wait a few weeks until this weekend, when back in the studio the judges will finally choose their finalists LIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 24-Oct-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e5ba8ced09b3ccda8f704abaee9264905e1ede","amp;dn":"The+X+Factor+UK+S12E13+WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e5ba8ced09b3ccda8f704abaee9264905e1ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,229,186,140,237,9,179,204,218,143,112,74,186,238,146,100,144,94,30,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
