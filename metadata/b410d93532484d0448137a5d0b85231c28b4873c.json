He was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm &amp; blues, gospel, and blues styles into his early recordings with Atlantic Records.[1][2][3] He also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his Modern Sounds albums.[4][5][6] While with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company.[2] Frank Sinatra called Charles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe only true genius in show business.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nRolling Stone ranked Charles number 10 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; in 2004,[7] and number two on their November 2008 list of &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;.[8] In honoring Charles, Billy Joel noted: &quot;This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley. I don't know if Ray was the architect of rock &amp; roll, but he was certainly the first guy to do a lot of things . . . Who the hell ever put so many styles together and made it work?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Anyone Ask For More  2004\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\nWhat'd I Say\nHow Long, How Long Blues \nAlone in the City \nCan Anyone Ask for More \nYou Always Miss the Water (When the Well Runs Dry)\n A Sentimental Blues \nDon't Put All Your Dreams in One Basket \nKiss Me Baby \nI've Had My Fun (Going Down Slow) \nShe's on the Ball \nI'm Going Down the River \nBaby Won't You Please Come Home \n Rockin' Chair Blues \nI Got a Woman \nSittin' on Top of the World (Now She's Gone) \nAin't That Fine \nSomeday \nThe Midnight Hour \nBlues Is My Middle Name\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\nGeorgia on My Mind \nRoll with Me Baby\nThe Sun's Gonna Shine Again\nJumpin' in the Morning\nThe Midnight Hour\nIt Should Have Been Me\nHeartbreaker\nSinner's Prayer \nMess Around\nLosing Hand \nFunny But I Still Love You\nFeelin' Sad\nI Wonder Who \nDon't You Know \nRay's Blues \nNobody Cares\nMr. Charles Blues \nBlack Jack \nI Got a Woman\nCome Back Baby \nGreenbacks\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b410d93532484d0448137a5d0b85231c28b4873c","amp;dn":"Ray+Charles+-+Ask+For+More+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2004+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b410d93532484d0448137a5d0b85231c28b4873c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,16,217,53,50,72,77,4,72,19,122,93,11,133,35,28,40,180,135,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
