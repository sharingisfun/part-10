If you like jazz, if you like rock, if you like fusion drifting to metal too then you should appreciate his production.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive discography, since I stumbled on a good bunch in flac and I wanted to share it lossless as much as possible. There are 29 albums covering his main production and some collaborations and the AVI rip of a 2001 Live Concert in Paris with Shawn Lane and the Vinayakrams. The albums are all in flac except for 4 of them which I was unable to find lossless.\n\nSeveral of the missing collaborations albums are available in other torrents of mine (i.e.: John Maughlin's and Trilok Gurtu's).\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n____________\n\nTrackers:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.h33t.com:3310/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.h33t.com:3310/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.istole.it:6969\n\nudp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce\n\nudp://open.demonii.com:1337\n\n____________\n\n\nAlbum list:\n\n1979 - The Bassic Thing - 320\n1984 - Elegant Punk - 224\n1988 - Axis\n1988 - Bass\n1988 - with Kollektiv - Kollektiv\n1989 - Adfa\n1990 - Jonas Hellborg Group\n1990 - The Word - 320\n1990 - with Ginger Baker - Middle Passage\n1991 - E\n1991 - The Silent Life\n1992 - with RAF - Ode To A Tractor\n1993 - Octave Of The Holy Innocents\n1994 - with Glen Velez - Ars Moriende\n1995 - with Shawn Lane, Jeff Sipe - Uppsala Nov. 28, 1995\n1995 - with Shawn Lane, Kofi Baker - Abstract Logic\n1996 - with Shawn Lane, Jeff Sipe - Temporal Analogues of Paradise\n1997 - with Shawn Lane - Time Is The Enemy\n1999 - Aram of the Two Rivers\n1999 - with Shawn Lane, Jeff Sipe - Zenhouse\n1999 - with Sultan Khan, Fazal Qureshi - Friends Across Boundaries\n2000 - with Bill Laswell - Filmtracks\n2000 - with Shawn Lane, Selvaganesh - Good People in Times Of Evil\n2001 - Live at New Morning Paris, France, May 15th - AVI\n2001 - with Lane, Vinayakrams - Paris DVD (audio rip) - 256\n2002 - with Shawn Lane, Jeff Sipe  - Personae\n2003 - Icon\n2006 - Kali's Son\n2007 - Art Metal\n2014 - with Mattias IA Eklundh, Ranjit Barot - The Jazz Raj\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfdefe4dfa5505aa20d4dc58b2e8345b42b4b077","amp;dn":"Jonas+Hellborg+1979+-+2014+discography+-+flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfdefe4dfa5505aa20d4dc58b2e8345b42b4b077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,222,254,77,250,85,5,170,32,212,220,88,178,232,52,91,66,180,176,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
