The Dictionary of Applied Mathematics for Engineers and Scientists fills that void. It contains authoritative yet accessible definitions to mathematical terms often encountered in other disciplines.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3294e2b3f8dd4ba49363947f5f26f725c71f812","amp;dn":"Dictionary+of+Applied+Math+for+Engineers+and+Scientists+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3294e2b3f8dd4ba49363947f5f26f725c71f812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,41,78,43,63,141,212,186,73,54,57,71,245,242,111,114,92,113,248,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
