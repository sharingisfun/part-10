George Harrison was a well-known advocate of the small four-string instrument, and VedderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hero Pete Townshend once cut a lovely little gem called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue Red and GreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on ukulele, a song that could easily slide onto this gently ramshackle collection of covers, re-recordings, and new tunes. To say that this is a minor album is to dismiss its intimacy and miss its appeal: VedderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-imposed curse is that he takes everything very seriously indeed, so to hear him without the weight of the world on his shoulders is disarmingly inviting. He has nothing more in mind on Ukulele Songs than singing, whether itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s with duet partners Glen Hansard and Cat Power or just on his own, tossing out love songs, something he generally has avoided with Pearl Jam. Vedder never has been ashamed of his bleeding heart -- itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something that grounds Pearl Jam even when theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in full-blast bombast mode -- yet itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s refreshing to have a record where that heart is pushed toward the center, beating fully and proudly on his lightest, sweetest album yet. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e795c4fde0cc27cfed7a5b91ddfad389517037e","amp;dn":"Eddie+Vedder...Ukulele+Songs%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e795c4fde0cc27cfed7a5b91ddfad389517037e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,121,92,79,222,12,194,124,254,215,165,185,29,223,173,56,149,23,3,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
