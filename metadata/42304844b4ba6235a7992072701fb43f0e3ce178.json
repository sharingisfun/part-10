A criminal, a thug, and a brawler, he was the master of bad choices, until one such choice landed him in prison for five years. Now Bax is out and looking for answers, and he doesn't care what he has to do or who he has to hurt to get them. But there's a new player in the game, and she's much too innocent, much too softÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and standing directly in his way.\n\nDovie Pryce knows all about living a hard life and the tough choices that come with it. She's always tried to be good, tried to help others, and tried not to let the darkness pull her down. But the streets are fighting back, things have gone from bad to worse, and the only person who can help her is the scariest, sexiest, most complicated ex-con the Point has ever produced.\n\nBax terrifies her, awakening feelings she never thought she'd have for a guy like him. But it doesn't take Dovie long to realizeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦some boys are just better when they're bad.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42304844b4ba6235a7992072701fb43f0e3ce178","amp;dn":"Better+When+He%27s+Bad+%28Welcome+to+the+Point+Book+1%29+Jay+Crownover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42304844b4ba6235a7992072701fb43f0e3ce178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,48,72,68,180,186,98,53,167,153,32,114,112,31,180,63,14,60,225,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
