Fine-tuned for powerful club sound systems, DARK PRESSURE puts an impressive array of four-on-the-floor rhythms at your fingertips Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from full-on energy to hypnotic groove and triplet-driven swing.\n\nThis is also the first MASCHINE Expansion to include pre-sliced percussion loops (64) for instant remixing. These loops are a source of inspiration when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re composing, and a great way to apply some additional layered rhythms to your productions.\n\nHis production and DJ style walks a line between upfront sounds for main rooms and tough, percussive underground grooves for dark warehouses. Now, with DARK PRESSURE, the secrets of his crowd-thrilling sets are in your hands.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bc19b8080a2ae569e5363cf20a25e978b586477","amp;dn":"Maschine+Packs+-+Dark+Pressure+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bc19b8080a2ae569e5363cf20a25e978b586477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,193,155,128,128,162,174,86,158,83,99,207,32,162,94,151,139,88,100,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
