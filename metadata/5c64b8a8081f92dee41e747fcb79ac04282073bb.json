During an arms raid at a tea house, his partner is shot and killed right before his eyes. Although Tequila immediately blasted the murderer, it just wasn?t enough to satisfy him. Now he is dedicated to ending the ring of weapons smuggling that is escalating in town. Also involved is a fellow cop undercover as a triad. Once they team up, no criminal is safe and the bloodshed culminates in some of the most amazing gunplay sequences ever captured on film.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c64b8a8081f92dee41e747fcb79ac04282073bb","amp;dn":"Hard+Boiled+%5BChow+Yun+Fat%5D%5BJohn+Woo%5D%5BCantonese+w%2F+Eng+Sub%2C+DVDRi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c64b8a8081f92dee41e747fcb79ac04282073bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,100,184,168,8,31,146,222,228,30,116,127,203,121,172,4,40,32,115,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
