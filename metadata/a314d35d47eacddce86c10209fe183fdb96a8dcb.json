The two Navajo cops, one old and one young--who originally debuted in separate series but have been collaborating for many books now--are among the most engaging, fully human characters in crime fiction. As usual, Hillerman puts them to work in a suspenseful, satisfying tale that integrates a wealth of Navajo lore plus breathtaking evocations of the American Southwest, all delivered in prose as clear, clean, and easy-flowing as a mountain stream. Longtime readers will be delighted by several developments, including a prominent role for the appealing Officer Bernadette Manuelito and a glimpse at the phlegmatic Leaphorn's testy side. But Hillerman welcomes new arrivals as well, with enough exposition to get you oriented.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a314d35d47eacddce86c10209fe183fdb96a8dcb","amp;dn":"Wailing+Wind+by+Tony+Hillerman+%5BNavasteries+%2315%5D+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a314d35d47eacddce86c10209fe183fdb96a8dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,20,211,93,71,234,205,220,232,108,16,32,159,225,131,253,185,106,141,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
