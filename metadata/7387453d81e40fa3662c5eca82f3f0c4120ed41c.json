The\nalbum is noted for a blend of regular rock and acoustic rock tracks\nwith shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles\nemployed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second\ntime the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave\nGrohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and\nhave a record that sounded different from their previous work. Grohl\ntried to focus on songs with messages that resonated on the audience\nwriting reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from the birth of\nhis daughter.\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01 - The Pretender [04:29]\n  02 - Let It Die [04:05]\n  03 - Erase Replace [[04:13]\n  04 - Long Road To Ruin [03:44]\n  05 - Come Alive [05:10]\n  06 - Stranger Things Have Happened [05:21]\n  07 - Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running) [03:14]\n  08 - Summer's End [04:37]\n  09 - Ballad Of The Beaconsfield Miners [02:32]\n  10 - Statues [03:47]\n  11 - But, Honestly [04:35]\n  12 - Home [04:52]\n  13 - Once And For All [Demo] [03:47]\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Foo Fighters\nGenre: Alternative rock / post-grunge / hard rock[\nAlbum Release Year: 2007\nNumber of Tracks: 13\nTotal Duration: 60 Minutes\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 918 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original CD Release\nConverter: EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheet, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 361 MB\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7387453d81e40fa3662c5eca82f3f0c4120ed41c","amp;dn":"Foo+Fighters+-+Echoes%2C+Silence%2C+Patience+n+Grace+2007+%5BEAC+-+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7387453d81e40fa3662c5eca82f3f0c4120ed41c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,135,69,61,129,228,15,163,102,44,94,202,130,243,240,196,18,14,212,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
