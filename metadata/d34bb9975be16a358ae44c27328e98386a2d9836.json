Special attention is given to the complex mining of mineral resources, such as: iron ore, coal deposits with drilling advance degassing wells, methane extraction from coal and anthropogenic deposits, heat receipt from mine water with help of thermal pumps.\nThe unique geological conditions for mining in Poland and the Ukraine require a new technological approach for mining thin and very thin coal seams with thickness of 1 meter and less, using selective coal extraction methods, leaving rock behind in the mine. Relevant technological solutions are discussed in this volume.\nFurther, technological process control during coal seams underground gasification is described together with pressure-temperature conditions of gas hydrates formation from gaseous mixtures of various content. Substantiation is also given to gas hydrates extraction technologies development and 21st century new pulse technologies of well drilling and a temperature mode of a rock-cutting tool and equipment with cryogenic-gravel filters is examined.\nGas extraction processes located in flooded deposits with uniform and macroheterogeneous collectors are presented with the description of an effective methodology of two-subbench technology of ore deposits extraction.\n\nAbout the Author\nProf. Dr. Volodymyr Bondarenko is Head of the Department of Deposit Mining of National Mining University of Ukraine, Dr. Sc. (Tech), Professor, Academician of the Academy of Engineering Sciences of Ukraine, Honoured Scientist of Science and Engineering, Laureate of the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Science and Technology.\nVolodymyr Bondarenko is a famous specialist in the field of underground mining of coal and ore deposits and author of scientific papers on mining. He is a chairman of the methodological committee of higher education standards preparation of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Ukraine for his speciality &quot;Mining&quot;. \nIryna Kovalevska (1968) graduated from the department of Mechanics, mechanical-mathematical faculty of DnipropetrovskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s state university in 1990. She is a mechanic, applied mathematics specialist.She took a post-graduate course at the Institution of Geotechnical Mechanics of the Ukraine named after M.S. Polyakov, defended dissertations of technical sciences candidate and doctor of technical sciences, and finally became professor of Underground Mining Department of theNational Mining University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34bb9975be16a358ae44c27328e98386a2d9836","amp;dn":"Progressive+Technologies+of+Coal%2C+Coalbed+Methane%2C+and+Ores+Mini","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34bb9975be16a358ae44c27328e98386a2d9836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,75,185,151,91,225,106,53,138,228,76,39,50,142,152,56,106,45,152,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
