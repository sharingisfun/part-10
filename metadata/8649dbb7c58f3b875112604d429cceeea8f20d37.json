The Fireballs, who used the same Norman Petty-run studio in Clovis, NM, as Buddy Holly, had a much more prominent &quot;border&quot; music feel to their melodies than the Ventures. The Ventures, on the other hand, had a much more full-bodied and versatile attack, accounting to a large degree for the Fireballs' comparatively slight place in history. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Do You Think\n02.Wishing\n03.True Love Ways\n04.Call In The Sheriff\n05.Don't Stop\n06.Good Good Lovin'\n07.It Won't Be Long\n08.Sugar Shack\n09.Ain't Gonna Tell Anybody\n10.Daisy Petal Pickin'\n11.When My Tears Have Dried\n12.Look At Me\n13.I'll Send For You\n14.What Kinda Love\n15.Cry Baby\n16.Bullmoose\n17.Lonesome Tears\n18.Indian Giver\n19.Red Cadillac And A Black Mustache\n20.Almost Eighteen\n21.Pretend\n22.I Wonder Why\n23.Maybe Baby\n24.Everyday\n25.Little Baby\n26.It's So Easy\n27.Bottle Of Wine\n28.Come On, React!\n29.Goin' Away\n30.Can't You See I'm Trying\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8649dbb7c58f3b875112604d429cceeea8f20d37","amp;dn":"The+Fireballs+-+The+Best+Of+%282004%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8649dbb7c58f3b875112604d429cceeea8f20d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,73,219,183,197,143,59,135,81,18,96,77,66,156,206,238,168,242,13,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
