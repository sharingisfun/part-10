A concept album, the record tells the story of the life, love, and death of a rough-and-tumble Irish immigrant, even going so far as to include an obituary in the liner notes. Musically, the album doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stray far from the sound the band has developed over the years, which definitely isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a bad thing. With their fusion of Celtic and punk, Dropkick Murphys have set themselves far enough apart from the bulk of punk rock that changing anything would feel disingenuous. Instead, the band freshens things up with the bold choice of making a punk rock concept album. This narrative element really works for Dropkick Murphys, adding another layer of thematic unity that complements their sonic vision wonderfully.\n\nReleased: March 1, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks: \n\n  1.
