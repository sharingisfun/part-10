From being flat broke in segregated Baltimore to living in a mansion with servants of his own, he becomes the toast of a city obsessed with music, money, pleasure and power, even as it ignores the rising winds of war.\n\nSong Yuhua is refined, educated, and bonded since age eighteen to ShanghaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful crime boss in payment for her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gambling debts. Outwardly submissive, she burns with rage and risks her life spying on her master for the Communist Party.\n\nOnly when Shanghai is shattered by the Japanese invasion do Song and Thomas find their way to each other. Though their union is forbidden, neither can back down from it in the turbulent years of occupation and resistance that follow. Torn between music and survival, freedom and commitment, love and world war, they are borne on an irresistible riff of melody and improvisation to Night in ShanghaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final, impossible choice.\n\nIn this impressively researched novel, Nicole Mones not only tells the forgotten story of black musicians in the Chinese Jazz age, but also weaves in a stunning true tale of Holocaust heroism little-known in the West.\n\nGenre: General Fiction/Classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a51adfc15370ef1a98ec75300a32045899cf0979","amp;dn":"Night+in+Shanghai+by+Nicole+Mones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a51adfc15370ef1a98ec75300a32045899cf0979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,26,223,193,83,112,239,26,152,236,117,48,10,50,4,88,153,207,9,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
