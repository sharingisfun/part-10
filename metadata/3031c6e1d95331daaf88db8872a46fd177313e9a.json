Designed specifically for graduate students and practitioners of public health, the book highlights the aspects of leadership unique to this field. Building on several existing competency-based models, the book focuses on preparing public health professionals to invigorate bold(er) pursuit of population health, engage diverse others in public health initiatives, effectively wield power, prepare for surprise in public health work, and drive for execution and continuous improvement in public health programs and organizations. It is based on research from leadership theory and practice and combines the viewpoint of a prominent scholar with that of a seasoned practitioner.\n\nBased on the premise that public health as a field is undervalued in health policy and practice, the book addresses the need for more informed and proactive public health leadership and describes the values, traits, and knowledge that undergird such leadership. At its heart are detailed examinations of 25 specific competencies required for effective public health leadership. Written in accessible and engaging language, the book includes 19 case studies and multiple examples from public health practice to demonstrate the successful application of leadership competencies. With an eye to the future, the book also includes content on emerging public health challenges, complexity science, innovation, resilience, quality improvement, and leading during unexpected events.\n\nKey Features:\nEmpowers public health students and practitioners with leadership knowledge and competencies\nExamines 25 specific competencies required for effective public health leadership\nCombines the expertise of an academic and a practicing health care leader\nProvides abundant case examples from public health practice\nPresents leadership development as a lifelong process","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3031c6e1d95331daaf88db8872a46fd177313e9a","amp;dn":"Leading+Public+Health-+James+Begun+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3031c6e1d95331daaf88db8872a46fd177313e9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,49,198,225,217,83,49,218,175,136,219,136,114,164,111,209,119,49,62,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
