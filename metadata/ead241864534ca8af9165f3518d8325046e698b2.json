Full of gallows humour, The Wipers Times was poignant, subversive and very funny. Produced literally under enemy fire and defying both authority and gas attacks, the magazine proved a huge success with the troops on the western front. It was, above all, a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity. In his spare time, Roberts also managed to win the Military Cross for gallantry.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 21 (~3406Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 89 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 2.19 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead241864534ca8af9165f3518d8325046e698b2","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Wipers+Times+1080p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead241864534ca8af9165f3518d8325046e698b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,210,65,134,69,52,202,138,249,22,95,53,24,216,50,80,70,230,152,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
