A cloth dyerâ€™s daughter, she grows up in a little house in the woods where her motherâ€“ashamed of her markâ€“can keep her far away from prying eyes. But on the night before her younger sisterâ€™s wedding, Flavia does something drastic, something that will draw her into a much wider and stranger world than she could have imaged from her secluded family cottage. Flavia finds herself at the convent of Santa Giuliana, just outside the city walls of Perugia.\r\nThere she meets Ghostanza, a courtesan-turned-widow, whose white-lead painted face entrances Flavia, and whose beauty is matched only by her cruelty. Flavia becomes her ornatrix: her hairdresser and personal maid. But as white-lead paint rots the flesh below it, so Perugia, and Santa Guiliana, is rotting below the shimmer of wealth and privilege. And Flavia is drawn into a world of desire and jealousy that has devastating consequences.\r\nRich in description and character, Kate Howardâ€™s stunning debut novel is painted against a vivid historical landscape with themes and characters relevant today, tackling issues of belonging, female identity, and the perception of beauty. It cannot fail to move.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf60130cb60604ba5c6c2ca91452cffc119cb9f","amp;dn":"The+Ornatrix+-+Kate+Howard+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf60130cb60604ba5c6c2ca91452cffc119cb9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,246,1,48,203,96,96,75,165,198,194,202,145,69,44,255,193,25,203,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
