Cale\nThe Definitive Collection (2006)\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nWith his laid-back rootsy style, J.J. Cale is best known for writing &quot;After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Cocaine,&quot; songs that Eric Clapton later made into hits. But Cale's influence wasn't only through songwriting -- his distinctly loping sense of rhythm and shuffling boogie became the blueprint for the adult-oriented roots rock of Clapton and Mark Knopfler, among others. Cale's refusal to vary the sound of his music over the course of his career caused some critics to label him as a one-trick pony, but he managed to build a dedicated cult following with his sporadically released recordings. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tmp3 @320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Call Me The Breeze\n02.Crazy Mama\n03.Magnolia\n04.After Midnight\n05.Lies\n06.Midnight In Memphis\n07.Cajun Moon\n08.Rock And Roll Records\n09.Cocaine\n10.Hey Baby\n11.I'll Make Love To You Anytime\n12.Don't Cry Sister\n13.Thirteen Days\n14.Sensitive Kind\n15.Carry On\n16.Mama Don't\n17.City Girls\n18.Devil In Disguise\n19.Don't Wait\n20.Money Talks\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98ae5c066ec8898156883809263eb9154437f40","amp;dn":"J.J.+Cale+-+The+Definitive+Collection++%282006%29+%7B320%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f98ae5c066ec8898156883809263eb9154437f40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,138,229,192,102,236,136,152,21,104,131,128,146,99,235,145,84,67,127,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
