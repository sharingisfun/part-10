They also wrote some catchy and energetic, if slightly sappy, originals in the purest Merseybeat style. While it doesn't add up to an enduring legacy, there's a lot to be said for the naive energy of the best of their early tunes.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wpfixq95ldfe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wpfixq95ldfe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nWeighing in at a hefty 34 tracks, this is the most exhaustive Swinging Blue Jeans anthology available. Do not mistake this, however, for the best collection of these cheery Liverpool British Invaders. That honor belongs to the American Hippy Hippy Shake collection, which is nearly as comprehensive (at 26 tracks) but much more well chosen. All their U.K. hits -- half a dozen, more or less -- are included here, as well as many B-sides, flop singles, and eight previously unreleased tracks (most of which bear the writing credits &quot;unknown,&quot; even the relatively well-known Little Richard song &quot;Ready Teddy&quot;). At their best, the Blue Jeans were one of the better British Invasion pop-rockers, and they did manage a fair number of good tracks, but a great deal of the selections here are uneventful or downright difficult to bear in their dated quaintness, fallow MOR pop, or lame rehashing of '50s rock. The small bonus is that the version of their 1968 single &quot;Now That You've Got Me (You Don't Seem to Want Me),&quot; written by Clint Ballard (also responsible for &quot;You're No Good&quot; and other great '60s tunes), is, for some reason, much better than the one on Hippy Hippy Shake. That's hardly worth the fairly hefty price of this import -- stick with the U.S. compilation.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Three Little Fishes\n02. Now I Must Go\n03. Hippy Hiip Shake\n04.
