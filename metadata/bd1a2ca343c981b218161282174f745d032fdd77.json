Sookie thinks that, at least this time, the dead girl's fate has nothing to do with her. But she is wrong. She has an enemy, one far more devious than she would ever suspect, who's out to make Sookie's world come crashing down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1a2ca343c981b218161282174f745d032fdd77","amp;dn":"Charlaine+Harris+-+Sookie+Stackhouse+-Deadlocked+%28bookeek%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1a2ca343c981b218161282174f745d032fdd77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,26,44,163,67,201,129,178,24,22,18,130,23,79,116,93,3,47,221,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
