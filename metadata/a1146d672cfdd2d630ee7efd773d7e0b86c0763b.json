CJB's fiddle player, Chris Whitten, is a Lawton native who was recently touring with Kevin Fowler's band. Here, Whitten really adds a feeling of authenticity to the strong song.\n\n&quot;Nobody to Blame,&quot; the single, is an acoustic country ballad that sounds all the sweeter with Whitten's fiddle.\n\nWith its fresh, clean guitar sound, Johnson's voice soars on in &quot;Finally Free.&quot;\n\nThe road map painted on &quot;Texas Kind of Way&quot; is a little clich?, but the rockin' guitar solo gives it an appealing edginess that works for Johnson.\n\nThere's no getting around the fact that &quot;Slam the Door&quot; sounds like a Waylon Jennings song. Johnson shares vocals with Texas music newcomer Brison Bursey of the Brison Bursey Band. This is the best song on the album.\n\nProducer Keith Davis, a guitarist in his own right who is with the Scott Wiggins Band, helps showcase Johnson's strong whiskey-kissed vocals and the solid musicianship of guitarist Matt Rogers, bassist Danny Salinas and drummer Nathan Reedy, a Bartlesville native.\n\n&quot;Six Strings One Dream&quot; is a fine album and one worthy of further attention on the Texas/Red Dirt/country music scene.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
