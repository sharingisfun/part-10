Ngor), the latter left at the mercy of the Khmer Rouge after Schanberg--who chose to stay after American evacuation but was booted out--failed to get him safe passage. Filmmaker Roland JoffÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, previously a documentarist, made his feature debut with this account of Dith's rocky survival in the ensuing madness of the Khmer Rouge's genocidal campaign. The script spends some time with Schanberg's feelings of guilt after the fact, but most of the movie is a shattering re-creation of hell on Earth. The late Haing S. Ngor--a real-life doctor who had never acted before and who lived through the events depicted by JoffÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©--is outstanding, and he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Oscars also went to cinematographer Chris Menges and editor Jim Clark.\n\nProduct Description\n\nWaterston stars as New York Times reporter Schanberg, a journalist who covered the war in Cambodia. Ngor stars as Dith, the translator and aide, who is exiled to Cambodian labor camps where millions of others have died.\nGenre: Feature Film-Drama\nRating: R\nRelease Date: 13-MAR-2001\nMedia Type: DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a964b2f931554960afaeed4405f5342b45914c0","amp;dn":"The+Killing+Fields+%281984%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a964b2f931554960afaeed4405f5342b45914c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,150,75,47,147,21,84,150,10,250,238,212,64,95,83,66,180,89,20,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
