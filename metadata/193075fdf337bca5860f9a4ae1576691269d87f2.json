What if an alien race had a reason to keep humanity entrenched in fear? And what if ancient beings that we've met before were still trying to protect us? And just what if the fate of Earth depended upon an average 17-year-old girl with a few secrets of her own? \n\nWould she discover that the power of love was truly the strongest of all? \n\n\n&quot;THE GLASS WALL&quot; - Book One of the &quot;Glass Wall&quot;: \n\n- A mysterious and dangerously handsome stranger ... \n- A slightly jaded 17-year-old girl ... \n- A paranormal world hidden within our own ... \n\n17-year-old Sydney's only interest in life is flying under the radar. But destiny has other plans when the tall, handsome, and unusual Rafael Channing moves into the neighborhood. Athletic and with killer looks, he wears black eyeliner like a magician and always seems to be there when she needs him the most. \n\nWhat starts out as a light-hearted investigation with her gadget-happy foster father takes a serious turn when she discovers that Rafael isn't human. Add Jareth, the country's latest rock sensation, into the mix and Sydney is swept into a mysterious world of Tulpas, the Fae, and the Brotherhood of the Snake. \n\nSydney doesn't know she's a Blue Thread of Fate. She doesn't know the fate of humanity depends on her choice of whom to trust--Jareth or Rafael. And she certainly doesn't know that she's taken the first step on the unexpected path of love. \n\n\n\n&quot;THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE SNAKE&quot; - Book Two of the &quot;Glass Wall&quot;: \n\n- The first kiss ... \n- A secret revealed ... \n- The arrival of the Mesmers ... \n\nAfter breaking the Glass Wall, Sydney finds herself on the run with Rafael. And as her feelings for him awaken, danger arrives in the form of Mesmers, agents of evil sent by the Brotherhood of the Snake. But when Jareth struts back onto the scene, it isn't long before Sydney finds herself immersed in sinister secrets, and the subsequent whirlwind of events leaves her wondering just who is right and who is wrong? \n\n\n\n&quot;THE INNER CIRCLE&quot; - Book Three of the &quot;Glass Wall&quot;: \n\n- A love is born that cannot be denied ... \n- The Brotherhood of the Snake just might be winning ... \n- A Decision of Fate is made ... \n\nAs Sydney navigates through the supernatural dangers surrounding her, she seizes control of her destiny and begins to fight back. And as she spies on the Inner Circle and the Brotherhood of the Snake, she discovers the power of human thought. And finds out she can no longer deny the love that she feels. \n\nBut then both Rafael and Jareth's secrets are revealed and a Blue-Threaded decision of fate is made. But is it the right one? \n\n\n\n&quot;THE EGG&quot; - Book Four of the &quot;Glass Wall&quot;: \n\n- A death ... \n- A beginning Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ \n- An egg to change the world ... \n\nFaced with her Blue Thread of Fate, Sydney must make a choice if Rafael and Jareth are to survive. But what if it is an inner demon sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not expecting? Can she truly understand the many shades of love? \n\n\n\nPrequel - the short story &quot;BEHIND THE MIRROR&quot; \n\nRafael Channing is a Fate Tracker, protecting his world and Earth from disaster, but what should he do when disaster appears in the form of love?\n\n\nProduct Details:\nFile size:  epub 923 KB, mobi 1.32 MB\nLanguage: English\n\n\n\nNotes: Have tested this ebook out on the desktop PC using Calibre for the epub file and Kindle for the mobi.
