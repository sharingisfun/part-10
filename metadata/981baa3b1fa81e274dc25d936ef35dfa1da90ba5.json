My life has undoubtedly been harsher than others, being forced to live in a wheelchair and all, but my imagination, personality and drive to continue has helped me to write. It's impossible to know if I'd still write if not for being a quadriplegic, but I've come to enjoy writing and sharing my passion and stories with others. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6924364.H_Lee_Morgan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6924364.H_Lee_Morgan&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:981baa3b1fa81e274dc25d936ef35dfa1da90ba5","amp;dn":"H.+Lee+Morgan%2C+Warlock+%28Complete+Works%29+-+sam2085","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"981baa3b1fa81e274dc25d936ef35dfa1da90ba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,27,170,59,31,168,30,39,77,194,93,147,110,243,93,250,29,169,11,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
