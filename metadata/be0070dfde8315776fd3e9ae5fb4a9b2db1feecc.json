Now, maybe, life is too easy for the ex-leatherneck. Not only does the beachfront motel George owned provide him with a place to live, but it also gives him a little spending money. Then he falls in love with the wife of a Miami millionaire and drops square in the middle of a dangerous con more deadly than sniper fire. With the stakes high and his heart on the line, George is bound to get caught in a nasty blast of crossfire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0070dfde8315776fd3e9ae5fb4a9b2db1feecc","amp;dn":"CAT+CHASER+-+Elmore+Leonard.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0070dfde8315776fd3e9ae5fb4a9b2db1feecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,0,112,223,222,131,21,119,111,211,233,174,95,180,169,178,219,31,238,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
