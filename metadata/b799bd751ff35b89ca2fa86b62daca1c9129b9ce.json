Because all currently available hardware does not yet contain a fixed-function decoder for HEVC, the current implementation utilizes the general shader and video processing units of the GPU. As a result the performance is lower and power consumption higher than you might expect. Future hardware will contain a fixed-function decoder and provide better acceleration. At this moment the decoder only works with high-end Intel (HD 4600/5x00/6x00) and NVIDIA (GTX 680/780/870/880/Titan) GPUs. Latest graphics driver is also required.\n\nFilename: K-Lite_Codec_Pack_1075_Full.exe\nSize: 30.218 KB\nMD5: c982526d3b0313dba41ca620160ff398\nSHA256: 3cf342b9c653e8f2705622e7b6ea0d96589f3fc20cbaeccef9a37ec922d5d8e4\n\nversion 10.7.7 ~ 12.3 MB ~ September 30th 2014\n\nUpdate for:\nK-Lite Codec Pack 10.7.5 and newer (Basic/Standard/Full/Mega)\n\nChangelog:\nUpdated MPC-HC to version 1.7.6.267\nUpdated LAV Filters to version 0.62-58-gd8d8713\n\nFilename: klcp_update_1077_20140930.exe\nSize: 12.641 KB\nMD5: e00f8b4a183c58bc422b3bec5d68fb02\nSHA256: 22c79c580dd4a0460ef824c693a26753569a873f7b7331c1ab753168d3e48633\n\n64-bit\nSince version 10.0.0 this package contains both 32-bit and 64-bit codecs. \nIt is no longer necessary to install 64-bit codecs separately.\n\nPrevious versions\nThe update pack above is only capable of updating a recent version of the codec pack. \nTo update an older version you need to install the latest version of the complete installer.\nOnce that is installed, you can install the update above if necessary.\n\nThe complete installers can be used to update any version of the codec pack. \nYou can simply install on top of your current installation. \nThe installer will automatically notify you if it is needed to uninstall the old version first, and offers to do that automatically.\n\nDo not forget to run installers as administrator.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b799bd751ff35b89ca2fa86b62daca1c9129b9ce","amp;dn":"K-Lite+Codec+Pack+10.7.7+%28Full%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b799bd751ff35b89ca2fa86b62daca1c9129b9ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,153,189,117,31,243,91,137,202,47,168,107,98,218,202,28,145,41,185,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
