Ripped by me personally in high quality h.264, these episodes come straight from the UK DVD box set.\n\n\nWatch using VLC, or any other media player that supports MKV/h.264 (all the decent codec packs support it).\n\nThere is one episode that has canned laughter, &quot;Our Finest Hour&quot;. This is because the original source material was damaged, so the syndicated version was used on the DVD. The quality is substantially lower than the other episodes, but this is how it appears on the DVD.\n\nSo far the first 7 seasons are up, 8 is ripped but untested. I'm watching the episodes before I upload them to check for quality, so I can guarantee that everything I upload is glitch free.\n\n***PLEASE***\n\nSeed for as long as you can, and always make sure you seed AT LEAST what you leech. I can't seed forever if you want new releases!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1052af019e8c80e5ba000554d11959e31313ea4e","amp;dn":"MASH+Season+7+-+No+Canned+Laughter+-+h.264+aac+HQ+%5BSlipTV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1052af019e8c80e5ba000554d11959e31313ea4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,82,175,1,158,140,128,229,186,0,5,84,209,25,89,227,19,19,234,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
