Indeed, with only a single exception,he is the poorest of his rank in the British Isles. It's a good thing therefore that he has two simple treasures in life: golfand his fiancee, Claire Fenwick. When she refuses to marry a man of only modest means, it stands to reason that he must go to where the money is and so Bill, in a moment of blinding inspiration, decides to go to America to seek his fortune. But even before he has left he receives the news that he is to inherit a million pounds. Problem solved isn't it?\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:206bf859475e7f4348aae24b4674ffe964f8891e","amp;dn":"Uneasy+Money+-+P.G.+Wodehouse+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"206bf859475e7f4348aae24b4674ffe964f8891e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,107,248,89,71,94,127,67,72,170,226,75,70,116,255,233,100,248,137,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
