Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner - PDF (OCR version)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhich is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask--but Levitt is not a typical economist. He studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life--from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing--and his conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. The authors show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives--how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In this book, they set out to explore the hidden side of everything. If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9dc4573e5dbda2d17a0a8018c7b7efc9541bfb","amp;dn":"Freakonomics+%28PDF%2C+OCR+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9dc4573e5dbda2d17a0a8018c7b7efc9541bfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,157,196,87,62,93,189,162,209,122,10,128,24,199,183,239,201,84,27,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
