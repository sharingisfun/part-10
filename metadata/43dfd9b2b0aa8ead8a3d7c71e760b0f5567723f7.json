Gone are the vaunted battles over the distribution of wealth and income. In their place are the powerfully rooted political battles fought between America's cultural poles: its racial and ethnic groups, its urban liberals and small town conservatives, its state's rightists and centrists, and ultimately also between advocates of culturally diverse positions and lifestyles.\n\nBesides his extensive knowledge of the historical record, his portrayal of individual participants, from FDR and Ronald Reagan through labor leader John L. Sullivan and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph, adds color and dimension to the narrative as it moves into contemporary times. \n\nWritten by: Michael Barone\nNarrated by: William Lavelle\nLength: 39 hrs and 58 mins\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:01-01-92\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43dfd9b2b0aa8ead8a3d7c71e760b0f5567723f7","amp;dn":"Our+Country+The+Shaping+of+America+from+Roosevelt+to+Reagan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43dfd9b2b0aa8ead8a3d7c71e760b0f5567723f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,223,217,178,176,170,142,173,138,61,124,113,231,96,176,245,86,119,35,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
