Write Great Code, Volume 2: Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level shows software engineers what too many college and university courses donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how compilers translate high-level language statements and data structures into machine code. Armed with this knowledge, they will make informed choices concerning the use of those high-level structures and help the compiler produce far better machine code Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all without having to give up the productivity and portability benefits of using a high-level language.\n\nIn this second volume of the Write Great Code series, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn:\n\n- How to analyze the output of a compiler to verify that your code does, indeed, generate good machine code\n- The types of machine code statements that compilers typically generate for common control structures, so you can choose the best statements when writing HLL code\n- Just enough 80Ãƒâ€”86 and PowerPC assembly language to read compiler output\n- How compilers convert various constant and variable objects into machine data, and how to use these objects to write faster and shorter programs\n\nWith an understanding of how compilers work, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to write source code that they can translate into elegant machine code. That understanding starts right here, with Write Great Code, Volume 2: Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1. Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level\nChapter 2.
