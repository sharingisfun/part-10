Translated by Chris Andrews.\n\nISBN: 9780811217057 | 280 pages | EPUB\n\n\nNAZI LITERATURE IN THE AMERICAS is a work of fiction by the Chilean author Roberto BolaÃƒÂ±o (1953-2003) and was the first of his books to reach a wide public.  When it was published by Seix Barral in 1996, critics in Spain were quick to recognize the arrival of an important new talent.  The book presents itself as a biographical dictionary of American writers who flirted with or espoused extreme right-wing ideologies in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is a tour de force of black humor and imaginary erudition. \n\nThe book is composed of short biographies, including descriptions of the writers' works, plus an epilogue (&quot;for Monsters&quot;), which includes even briefer biographies of persons mentioned in passing.  Although the writers are invented, they are all carefully situated in real literary worlds: BolaÃƒÂ±o's characters rebuff Allen Ginsberg's advances in Greenwich Village, encounter Octavio Paz in Mexico City, and quarrel with JosÃƒÂ© Lezama Lima in Cuba.\n\nChris AndrewsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ English translation was shortlisted for the 2008 Best Translated Book Award.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Nazi Literature in the Americas, a wicked invented encyclopedia of imaginary fascist writers and literary tastemakers, is BolaÃƒÂ±o playing with sharp, twisting knives.  As if he were Borges's wisecracking, sardonic son, BolaÃƒÂ±o has meticulously created a tightly woven network of far-right litterateurs and purveyors of belles lettres for whom Hitler was beauty, truth, and the great lostÃ‚Â hope.&quot; -- Stacey D'Erasmo, New York Times Book Review\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d388723def8a4e8ef5d772fbcd8e610360b40fb9","amp;dn":"Roberto+Bolano+-+Nazi+Literature+in+the+Americas+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d388723def8a4e8ef5d772fbcd8e610360b40fb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,136,114,61,239,138,78,142,245,215,114,251,205,142,97,3,96,180,15,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
