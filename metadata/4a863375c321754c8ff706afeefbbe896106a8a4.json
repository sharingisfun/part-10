But penetrating the reserve of high society households will take more finesse than Pitt can muster. Enter Charlotte Pitt, his wellborn wife, and her sister, Emily. As the social equals of the inhabitants of the Close, the women are privy to conversations that would never reach the ears of a mere policeman. What they find is a secret so shocking it will lead to more deathsÃ¢â‚¬â€including, quite possibly, PittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a863375c321754c8ff706afeefbbe896106a8a4","amp;dn":"Ann+Perry-Silence+in+Hanover+Close","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a863375c321754c8ff706afeefbbe896106a8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,134,51,117,195,33,117,76,143,247,6,175,238,251,190,137,97,6,168,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
