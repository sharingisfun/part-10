Taking its title from Jackson and Coltrane's nicknames, it is the only collaborative record by the pair, although only Jackson contributed original compositions.\n\n\n Vibraphonist Milt Jackson and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane make for a surprisingly complementary team on this 1959 studio session, their only joint recording. With fine backup by pianist Hank Jones, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Connie Kay, Bags and Trane stretch out on two of Jackson's originals (including &quot;The Late Late Blues&quot;) and three standards: a romping &quot;Three Little Words,&quot; &quot;The Night We Called It a Day,&quot; and the rapid &quot;Be-Bop.&quot; This enjoyable music has been included as part of Rhino's Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings box.
