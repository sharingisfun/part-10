His sole aim in life is to win the female he has just fallen in love with. Therefore, all the people around him become his victims. Not able to own up his crimes he is dragged down to hell.\n\nSir Peter Hall has long been associated with Glyndebourne, having directed there since 1970. His production of Mozart's tragic &quot;opera of all operas&quot;, as E.T.A. Hoffman once called it, for the 1977 Glyndebourne season has received universal praise - a high accolade for such an original production. Celebrated baritone and Glyndebourne favourite Benjamin Luxon perfectly embodies the unconscionable seducer Don Giovanni - although he nearly didn't appear after injuring himself during rehearsals jumping from a balcony as stage directions instructed.\n\nLuxon's supporting stars include Stafford Dean, Horiana Branisteanu and Leo Goeke, and Bernard Haitink conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce0f0cc9ba243dee1ada1dfaf325b994bedc9f0","amp;dn":"Don+Giovanni+-+Mozart+-+Glyndebourne+Chorus+-+Opera+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce0f0cc9ba243dee1ada1dfaf325b994bedc9f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,224,240,204,155,162,67,222,225,173,161,223,175,50,91,153,75,237,201,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
