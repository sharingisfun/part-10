The band's sound was compared to &quot;the jangly folk-pop of Fleet Foxes [and] hushed intimacy of Iron &amp; Wine&quot;.\n\nOne reviewer praised the album for &quot;some standout songs&quot; and the &quot;obvious&quot; talent of Tony Dekker, but criticized it for forgoing &quot;much of the mystique that made its predecessor [Ongiara] so intriguing&quot; and not having that album's same &quot;lasting appeal&quot;. However, the reviewer at the CBC praised the album as being the group's best, saying:\n\nThere's a magical, warm quality to the songs on Lost Channels, a richness and collective spirit that hasn't always been present in Great Lake Swimmers' songs. The Swimmers' first two albums, while still lovely, often felt a bit too breakable, that the airy arrangements supporting Dekker's plaintive confessionals might dissolve if you listened too hard. The seeds for a rootsier sound were planted on Ongiara and now they've come into full bloom.\nThe album was a shortlist nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b241063836d5f7ec26dd29a8f4e0e7790e866beb","amp;dn":"Great+Lake+Swimmers...Lost+Channels%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b241063836d5f7ec26dd29a8f4e0e7790e866beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,65,6,56,54,213,247,236,38,221,41,168,244,224,231,121,14,134,107,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
