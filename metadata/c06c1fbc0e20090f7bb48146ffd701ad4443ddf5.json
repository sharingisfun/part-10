They face challenges daily as our culture erodes Christian values through public schools, political compromises, the media, and peer pressures. They struggle to believe the Bible while the world keeps telling them that Christianity is an empty exercise. This book, the first in a groundbreaking new series, will give teens the insights they need into God's love and His WordÃ¢â‚¬â€answers that they will never receive from the world!\n\n\nAbout the author:\nKen Ham is the president/CEO and founder of Answers in Genesis - U.S. and the highly acclaimed Creation Museum. Ken Ham is one of the most in-demand Christian speakers in North America. Ken's emphasis is on the relevance and authority of the book of Genesis and how compromise on Genesis has opened a dangerous door regarding how the culture and church view biblical authority. His Australian accent, keen sense of humor, captivating stories, and exceptional PowerPoint illustrations have made him one of North America's most effective Christian communicators.\n\n\n\nFind great answers to these popular faith questions:\n-How can anyone believe that the Bible is true since it was written so long ago when people didn't know stuff?\n-If God's really so great, why does He let so much pain and bad stuff happen in the world, like earthquakes, floods, and wars??\n-I believe God created the earth, but does it really matter how old the earth is?\n-Who has the most evidence Ã¢â‚¬â€ creationists or evolutionists?\n-With everything I hear about God not existing . . . how can we even know that He does exist?\n-Come on, why would God punish the whole world for one guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mistake?\n-If God really loved the world, why would He make a flood to kill everyone off?\n-How could God populate the world with just two people a few thousand years ago?\n-Should people from different races marry each other, or is that wrong?\n-Why should I listen to what the Bible says about sex?\n-If Christians are supposed to love everybody, why do they always seem to hate gay people?\n-How are we supposed to talk about God and the Bible in school when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal?\n-How can we be sure Jesus is the only way to get to God?\n-The Bible . . . and dinosaurs . . . and dragons?\n-Why would God ever want to save someone as messed up as me?\n\n-Did creation really take just 6 days or did God use the big bang?\n-Noah's ark. . .
