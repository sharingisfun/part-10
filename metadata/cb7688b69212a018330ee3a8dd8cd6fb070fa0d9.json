Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI take no credit for this release, other than to expand the bandwidth capability \nof this collection to the bittorrent community for one of the highest quality \ncartoons to ever be put into production. I did not have any involvement in the \ncapturing, encoding, or initial distribution of this set of video files. \n\nThis torrent was uploaded and is seeded because of the death of the &quot;Sonic SatAM \nComplete DVD Collection&quot; torrent, which kept the community at 99.9% distribution \nfor several months. In response, the community now has access to the origonal \nfiles used in the DVD production through THIS torrent. If you want to support \nthe Sonic SatAM fanbase, return the favor and seed. Don&amp;#039;t let this die too!\n\nThese are the origonal files that are commonly seen slopply converted to mpeg2 \nfor use in DVDs on eBay. Currently this collection contians the highest quality \nepisodes you will find on the internet. If DiC, ABC, or whoever decides to \nrelease an official DVD collection, don&amp;#039;t download this, buy the boxset! In the \nmeantime, contact your local Sega, DiC, or Disney representative and ask to give \nus fans what we really want: a official DVD boxset. DVD sales have ressurected \nmany shows, we can hope for nothing less. Join a Sonic SatAM fansite and do your \npart!\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nSonic the Hedgehog is an American animated television series that was created by \nDiC, and aired from September 18, 1993 to June 3, 1995 on ABC. In contrast to \nthe comical Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog released almost simultaneously, \nthis cartoon features a darker setting and deeper, more involved story lines. \nAlso, it was based on the comic book series more than the game. To distinguish \nbetween the two series, fans typically refer to this as SatAM, because it was a \nSaturday morning cartoon, while Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog aired on \nweekdays in syndication. DiC was planing on making a third season of SatAM when \nABC decided to pull the plug on the show because of low ratings (the show with \nthe highest ratings at the time was Power Rangers) and also because the \npresident of ABC at that time simply disliked the show.\n\nFrom TV.com:\n&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog,&quot; also known as the SatAM (Saturday morning) series, was the \nsecond television program to star the famous video game icon. It followed the \nslapstick &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,&quot; which was known mostly for its \nlighthearted approach. The SatAM, however, took on a much darker tone, telling \nthe story of Sonic and his brave band of Freedom Fighters as they struggled to \nfree their home world, the distant planet of Mobius from the clutches of the \nevil Dr. Robotnik. \n\nThe first season was an unconventional mix of cartoon characters and a grim \nsetting. Characters were developed and mature themes were explored. The second \nseason, on the other hand, lightened the tone considerably, emphasizing the more \ncomedic aspects of the show and toning down the series&amp;#039; darkness considerably. \nThe show ultimately ended on a cliffhanger after only two seasons due to \nunderachieving ratings. However, this was not the end of the SatAM.\n\nThe series developed a cult following over the years resulting in countless fan \nfiction stories and discussion that kept show alive several years after it had \nbeen cancelled. Additionally, the Archie comic book adaptation of the &quot;Sonic&quot; \ncharacter began to modify itself to more closely resemble the SatAM series and \nremained in publishing ten years after the show had been cancelled. Furthermore, \nthe SatAM&amp;#039;s influence was felt in additional Sonic adventures with various \nelements of the series being included in the &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast!&quot; special \nand the &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; series. The SatAM is generally agreed to be the most \npopular of the American-made &quot;Sonic&quot; cartoons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb7688b69212a018330ee3a8dd8cd6fb070fa0d9","amp;dn":"Sonic+the+Hedgehog+SatAM+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb7688b69212a018330ee3a8dd8cd6fb070fa0d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,118,136,182,146,18,160,24,51,14,227,168,221,140,214,251,7,15,160,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
