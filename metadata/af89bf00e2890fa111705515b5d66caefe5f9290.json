As a result of intensive research and developmental efforts, the technology of generating energy from wind has significantly changed during the past five years. The book brings together all the latest aspects of wind energy conversion technology - right from the wind resource analysis to grid integration of the wind generated electricity. The chapters are contributed by academic and industrial experts having vast experience in these areas. Each chapter begins with an introduction explaining the current status of the technology and proceeds further to the advanced lever to cater for the needs of readers from different subject backgrounds. Extensive bibliography/references appended to each chapter give further guidance to the interested readers.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 223 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (April 22, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 354088257X\n# ISBN-13: 978-3540882572","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af89bf00e2890fa111705515b5d66caefe5f9290","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Wind+Energy+Conversion+Technology+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af89bf00e2890fa111705515b5d66caefe5f9290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,137,191,0,226,137,15,161,17,112,85,21,181,214,108,174,254,95,146,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
