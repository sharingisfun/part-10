Thanks to the OP.\n\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth is a 1952 drama film set in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. The film was produced, directed, and narrated by Cecil B. DeMille, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Its storyline is supported by lavish production values, actual circus acts, and documentary, behind-the-rings looks at the massive logistics effort which made big top circuses possible.\n\nThe film stars Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde as trapeze artists competing for the center ring, and Charlton Heston as the circus manager running the show. James Stewart also stars as a mysterious clown who never removes his make-up, even between shows.\n\nIn addition to the film actors, the real Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey's Circus' 1951 troupe appears in the film, with its complement of 1400 people, hundreds of animals, and 60 carloads of equipment and tents. The actors learned their respective circus roles and participated in the acts.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, the film's box office is among the highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada.\n\nA television series, also called The Greatest Show on Earth, was inspired by the film, but with Jack Palance in the role of Charlton Heston's character. The program ran on Tuesday evenings for thirty episodes on ABC during the 1963ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½1964 season.\n\nCast\n\nBetty Hutton \tas Holly\nCornel Wilde \tas The Great Sebastian\nCharlton Heston as Brad Braden\nJames Stewart \tas Buttons the Clown\nDorothy Lamour \tas Phyllis\nGloria Grahame \tas Angel\nHenry Wilcoxon \tas FBI Agent Gregory\nLyle Bettger \tas Klaus\nLawrence Tierney as Mr. Henderson\nBrad Johnson \tas unnamed reporter\n\n\nThe film features about 85 Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus acts, including clowns Emmett Kelly and Lou Jacobs, midget Cucciola, bandmaster Merle Evans and aerialist Antoinette Concello.\n\nThere are a number of unbilled cameo appearances (mostly in the circus audiences) including and Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, Dorothy Lamour's co-stars in the Road to... movies. William Boyd appears in his usual guise of Hopalong Cassidy. Danny Thomas, Van Heflin and Noel Neill are seen as circus patrons, among others. Leon Ames is seen and heard in the train wreck sequence. However, the plot and cameos play second fiddle to the documentary-like look at The Greatest Show On Earth in its last years under canvas.\n\nA barker, kept anonymous until the very end, is heard in the closing moments of the film. The voice is finally revealed to be that of Edmond O'Brien.\n\nAWARDS\n\nAt the 25th Academy Awards, the movie won Oscars for Best Picture (earning that recognition over films such as High Noon and The Quiet Man and the classic Singin' in the Rain) and for Best Story. It received nominations for Best Director, Best Film Editing, and Best Costume Design, Color.\n\nMany consider this film among the worst to have ever won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The American film magazine Premiere placed the movie on its list of the 10 worst Oscar winners and the British film magazine Empire rated it #3 on their list of the 10 worst Oscar winners. It has the second lowest spot on Rotten Tomatoes' list of the 81 films to win Best Picture.\n\nThere have been allegations that the film's Best Picture Oscar was due to the political climate in Hollywood in 1952. Senator Joseph McCarthy was pursuing Communists at the time, and Cecil B. DeMille was one of his supporters[citation needed]; another Best Picture nominee, High Noon, was produced by Carl Foreman, who would soon be on the Hollywood blacklist.\n\nAnother likely reason The Greatest Show On Earth was voted Best Picture of 1952 was that it was seen as a &quot;last chance&quot; vote for Cecil B. DeMille, to honor him for a lifetime of film making going well back into the silent movie era. DeMille's best work had been done before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was created. It may be that the members of the Academy (which included many veterans of the silent era) felt that as an elder statesman of Hollywood, he deserved the honor even if films like The Quiet Man, High Noon, Singing' in the Rain, Ivanhoe and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers were seen as better than The Greatest Show On Earth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752c84a4ffc8594b0b86fb7f6892bdb7a6f111b9","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+-+1952+-+The+Greatest+Show+on+Earth+%28Heston%2C+Lamour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752c84a4ffc8594b0b86fb7f6892bdb7a6f111b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,44,132,164,255,200,89,75,11,134,251,127,104,146,189,183,166,241,17,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
