He frequently performed with the slogan This Machine Kills Fascists displayed on his guitar. His best-known song is &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;. Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress.[1] Such songwriters as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Bruce Springsteen, Pete Seeger, Joe Strummer and Tom Paxton have acknowledged their debt to Guthrie as an influence.\n\nGuthrie traveled with migrant workers from Oklahoma to California and learned traditional folk and blues songs. Many of his songs are about his experiences in the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression, earning him the nickname the &quot;Dust Bowl Troubadour&quot;.[2] Throughout his life Guthrie was associated with United States communist groups, though he was allegedly not a member of any.[3]\n\nGuthrie was married three times and fathered eight children, including American folk musician Arlo Guthrie. He is the grandfather of musician Sarah Lee Guthrie.[4] Guthrie died from complications of Huntington's disease, a progressive genetic neurological disorder. During his later years, in spite of his illness, Guthrie served as a figurehead in the folk movement, providing inspiration to a generation of new folk musicians, including mentor relationships with Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan.\n\nWoody Guthrie was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Of Woody Guthrie 2008\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc: 1 \n\n\n1.
