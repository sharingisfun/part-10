Folk performers whom he befriended include Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, Patrick Sky, Phil Ochs, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Guthrie Thomas, and Joni Mitchell.\n\nAlthough Van Ronk was primarily an interpretive singer of traditional folk and blues songs along with covers of the songs of others, he still wrote a number of songs over his long career. Going Back to Brooklyn is the only album he made that is devoted entirely to his own compositions. Many of the songs were written, and some recorded, years and even decades previous to this release; however, all of the songs on this release were re-recorded specially for this album.\n\n01.&quot;Losers&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n02.&quot;Blood Red Moon&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:06\n03.&quot;Honey Hair&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:22\n04.&quot;Head Inspector&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:29\n05.&quot;Luang Prabang&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:36\n06.&quot;Antelope Rag&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:21\n07.&quot;Tantric Mantra&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:39\n08.&quot;Gaslight Rag&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:06\n09.&quot;Last Call&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:37\n10.&quot;Garden State Stomp&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n11.&quot;Zen Koans Gonna Rise Again&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:42\n12.&quot;The Whores of San Pedro&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:33\n13.&quot;Left Bank Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n14.&quot;Another Time and Place&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:37\n\n If you like the music, buy it!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92463946386aaca38de877fc5b2e6cf9d7366b6","amp;dn":"Dave+Van+Ronk+-+Going+Back+to+Brooklyn+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92463946386aaca38de877fc5b2e6cf9d7366b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,36,99,148,99,134,170,202,56,222,135,127,197,178,230,207,157,115,102,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
