He has attained astonishing mastery over the instrument. He was born into a family of shehnai players. \n\nHe made his first major public appearance in 1930 at the age of 14, when he played along with his uncle at the All India Music Conference in Allahabad. His second performance was at the Music Conference at the Lucknow Exhibition, where he won a gold medal for his recital.\n\nBismillah Khan was perhaps single handedly responsible for making the shehnai a famous classical instrument. He brought the shehnai to the center stage of Indian music with his concert in the Calcutta All India Music Conference in 1937. He was credited with having almost monopoly over the instrument as he and the shehnai are almost synomyms. \n\nHis concept of music was very beautiful and his vision, superb. He once said, &quot;Even if the world ends, the music will still survive&quot; and he often said, &quot;Music has no caste&quot;. \n\n[Note: Some of the albums have already been uploaded earlier by me (on Demonoid), so choose and download, if you wish]\n\nListing\n========\n\nMaestro&amp;#039;s Choice (192 kbps)\n-----------------\n01.
