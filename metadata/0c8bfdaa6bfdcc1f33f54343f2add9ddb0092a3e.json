But this triple-disc live set (culled from 1972 Long Beach/LA shows in advance of Houses of the Holy) addresses history with a vengeance, if a few decades late. These shows have rightfully assumed cult status in the bootleg market, showcasing a band at the peak of its creative and performing powers. Zep faithful will welcome the belated release as evidence for enduring loyalty, but younger fans may find its diversity and dynamics even more enlightening--indeed, whole careers have since been built on the musical ideas Jimmy Page and company toss off here as decorative filler. Crucially rooted in the amped-and-hammered American blues of the guitarist's former band, the Yardbirds, the marathon workouts of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; (which consume nearly an hour all by themselves) somehow encompass Ricky Nelson, Morocco, James Brown, Holst, Elvis Presley, and Muddy Waters amidst their trademark sturm und drang, while the acoustic set that closes out disc one showcases the band's--and particularly Robert Plant's--good-natured, crypto-Celtic folk appeal with energetic aplomb. Bigger and brasher than just about any rock act that followed in its historic wake, yet ever fan-loyal to its myriad influences, Led Zeppelin's live juggernaut finally gets the monument it deserves.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.LA Drone\n02.Immigrant Song\n03.Heartbreaker\n04.Black Dog\n05.Over The Hills And Far Away\n06.Since I've Been Loving You\n07.Stairway To Heaven\n08.Going To California\n09.That's The Way\n10.Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Dazed And Confused/Walter's Walk/The Crunge\n02.What Is And What Should Never Be\n03.Dancing Days\n04.Moby Dick\n\n\nDisc 3\n\n\n01.Whole Lotta Love/Boogie Chillun/Let's Have A Party/Hello Marylou/Going To California\n02.Rock And Roll\n03.The Ocean\n04.Bring It On Home/Bring It On Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n             ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c8bfdaa6bfdcc1f33f54343f2add9ddb0092a3e","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+How+The+West+Was+Won+3CD+%282003%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c8bfdaa6bfdcc1f33f54343f2add9ddb0092a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,139,253,170,107,253,204,31,51,245,67,67,242,173,217,221,176,9,42,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
