Hobbs tracks down Dominic and requests his help in bringing Shaw down; Dominic agrees when Hobbs presents him with a photo of Dominic's former girlfriend Letty Ortiz, whom he thought was dead. Dominic gathers his crew together and they accept the mission in exchange for full amnesty for their past crimes, which will allow them to return home to the United States; Mia and Elena remain with Jack.\n\nThe crew are led to Shaw's London hideout by one of his henchmen, but it is revealed to be a trap intended to distract the crew and police while Shaw's crew performs a heist elsewhere. Shaw flees by car, detonating his hideout behind him and disabling most of the police, leaving Dominic, Brian, Tej, Han, Gisele, Hobbs and Riley to pursue him. Letty arrives to help Shaw, and shoots Dominic without hesitation before escaping. Back at their headquarters, Hobbs tells Dominic's crew that Shaw is stealing components to create a Nightshade device which can disable power in an entire region; he intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, Shaw's investigation into the opposing crew reveals Letty's relationship with Dominic, but she is revealed to be suffering from amnesia.\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4a8860d4b53651dd55bedb19404d90f7489dfc","amp;dn":"Fast+and+Furious+6.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4a8860d4b53651dd55bedb19404d90f7489dfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,74,136,96,212,181,54,81,221,85,190,219,25,64,77,144,247,72,157,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
