Initially active from 1983 to 1991, they reformed in 2004. The band initially drew influence from second wave punk rock bands such as Discharge and The Exploited, and then adopted a straight forward thrash metal sound. To date, Onslaught have released five studio albums, one compilation, four singles and two live recordings: a live album and DVD. So what's different about this album as opposed to the last two? Well, Onslaught has been experimenting a bit... from the Egyptian-sounding guitar lines in Children Of The Sand (which couldn't fit the song better), to the nursery chimes reminiscent of Death Angel's song &quot;Falling Asleep&quot; at the open and close of 66'Fucking'6. All this while retaining the classic feel of Killing Peace.\n\nNot one of these songs lets up. If you're looking for a slow, melodic, acoustic Onslaught song... sorry to disappoint you but you're not going to find it here. Some songs have down-tempo sections, but there are most certainly no ballad-y songs, reinforcing the no-bullshit attitude from the band's Hardcore Punk background.\n\n\n \t\t 00 Onslaught album art 01.JPG  \t75.59 KB\n \t\t 00 Onslaught album art 02.JPG  \t67.72 KB\n \t\t01 A New World Order.mp3 320CBR \t1.43 MB\n \t\t02 Chaos Is King.mp3 320CBR     \t9.42 MB\n \t\t03 Fuel For My Fire.mp3 320CBR  \t11.71 MB\n \t\t04 Children Of The Sand.mp3 320CBR\t13.97 MB\n \t\t05 Slaughterize.mp3 320CBR      \t9.25 MB\n \t\t06 66 Fucking 6.mp3 320CBR      \t11.92 MB\n \t\t07 Cruci-Fiction.mp3 320CBR     \t11.82 MB\n \t\t08 Dead Man Walking.mp3 320CBR  \t9.43 MB\n \t\t09 Enemy Of My Enemy.mp3 320CBR \t11.86 MB\n \t\t10 Shellshock.mp3               \t15.25 MB\n \t\t Onslaught - VI.m3u             \t1.25 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f72b86a99dd7561820e998f35a9150911038fbd","amp;dn":"Onslaught+-+VI+%28320+CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f72b86a99dd7561820e998f35a9150911038fbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,114,184,106,153,221,117,97,130,14,153,143,53,169,21,9,17,3,143,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
