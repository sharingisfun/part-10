It is free, open source software that allows anyone to quickly and easily build web sites. Its full range of modulesÃ¢â‚¬â€including user permissions, security mechanisms, JavaScript menus, image uploaders, WYSIWYG editors, and moreÃ¢â‚¬â€ helps you easily create the foundation for a powerful web site. With its templating system (and a few tips and tricks), any graphic design file can be used to create a Drupal web site.\nFoundation Drupal 7 covers all the topics necessary to quickly build Drupal-powered web sites, explaining in simple terms how Drupal works and providing you with concepts, tips, and code snippets for every step of the development process. From setting up a Drupal-ready web host and installing Drupal to using the administrative interface and configuring a site from start to finish, there is something here for everyone. In addition to thoroughly discussing all of DrupalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core modules, this book reviews more than 50 contributed modules, including WYSIWYG HTML editors, JavaScript drop-down menus, web forms, and even the powerful Views module. Stephanie Pakrul, creator and maintainer of the Fusion theme, coauthors a chapter on how to lay out and add graphics to a site through DrupalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s administrative section. After reading this book, you will walk away with everything you need to know to quickly and successfully build a Drupal-powered web site.\n\n\n*Keep Learning and help us to share the knowledge across the World.\n tweet us @teamGOLU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69da187e4df2560b0b479b6165f1aea02ff62604","amp;dn":"Foundation+Drupal+7+-+Friendsof+%282010%29+PDF+-+GOLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69da187e4df2560b0b479b6165f1aea02ff62604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,218,24,126,77,242,86,11,11,71,155,97,101,241,174,160,47,246,38,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
