It explores the conflicts and demons that\r\nhave confronted Nashville's artists and music industry down the years, such as the\r\ncreative pressures of the 'Nashville Sound', the devastating impact of Elvis and\r\nthen Bob Dylan, the rise and fall of the urban cowboys and the struggle of several\r\nNashville legends to confront their inner demons.\r\n\r\nThe story unfolds through the testimony of musicians, producers, broadcasters and\r\nrare archive of the country legends. These include Dolly Parton, Charley Pride,\r\nWillie Nelson, Ricky Skaggs, Steve Earle, Kris Kristofferson and several hit-making\r\ncontemporary stars - Kasey Musgraves, Brad Paisley and Jason Aldean. This cast reveal\r\nthe unique power of country music to hold up a mirror to its fans and create a music\r\nthat has - for decades - touched the hearts of the South and of working people.\r\nKristofferson calls it the 'white man's soul music'.\r\n\r\nAlso featured are extensive musical performances by Nashville's greatest, from\r\nJohnny Cash to Loretta Lynn and George Jones to Garth Brooks. Several of Nashville's\r\nyounger stars describe their ongoing journey from their hometowns in the South to the\r\nstreets of this city, from the first studio demos and the sawdust of the Broadway bars\r\nto the stadiums and promo videos that now define country stardom..\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/76117266784086745324.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/25865536798310292589.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/25956879368942443249.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 935 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1200 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 1h 29mn\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6135d4e1ba2edfd5c1736fad4610bfc8e479e57","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Heart+of+Country+How+Nashville+Became+Music+City+USA+%5BMP4-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6135d4e1ba2edfd5c1736fad4610bfc8e479e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,19,93,78,27,162,237,253,92,23,54,250,212,97,11,252,142,71,158,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
