(Zac Brown BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sweet Annie is nowhere to be found). Apparently in its efforts to keep the charts current MediaBase will remove a song from the chart once it has dropped position 3 times in a row.  This is often called a Ã¢â‚¬Å“RecurrentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ single for radio airplay purposes.    \n\nOn Jan 21 of this year it was the #1 song, slipping to #5 the week after.  On Feb 4 it dropped to #13, and this week was removed from the chart, even though technically it received more airplay than most of the songs from #20-30.  \n\nTo the best of my knowledge all of the national countdown shows use Mediabase instead of Billboard data, possibly a sign of agreement that MediabaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formula is better, or perhaps the costs associated with using the name Billboard in conjunction with a countdown program are quite high.\n\nCheers,\n\nBaz-Master\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58424383ca37cd88040b1c338cb4ea2ba9dc9ca","amp;dn":"Top+30+Country+Feb+11%2C+2014+%28singles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58424383ca37cd88040b1c338cb4ea2ba9dc9ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,132,36,56,60,163,124,216,128,64,177,195,56,203,78,162,186,157,201,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
