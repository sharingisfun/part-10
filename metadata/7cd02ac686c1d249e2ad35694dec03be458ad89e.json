Grant is now a detective with the Seattle Police Department and long estranged from his sister. But his investigation into the bloody past of a high-class prostitute has led right to Paige's door, and what awaits inside is beyond his wildest imagining.\n\nOVER ANYONE WHO ENTERS\n\nHis only hope of survival and saving his sister will be to confront the terror that inhabits its walls, but he is completely unprepared to face the truth of what haunts his sister's brownstone.\n\n\nepub,mobi &amp; txt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd02ac686c1d249e2ad35694dec03be458ad89e","amp;dn":"Eerie+by+Blake+and+Jordan+Crouch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd02ac686c1d249e2ad35694dec03be458ad89e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,208,42,198,134,193,210,73,226,173,53,105,77,236,3,190,69,138,216,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
