Named after the day that new comics arrive in the U.S. comic shops, &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot; was a broadsheet anthology created to be reminiscent of the comic section in Sunday Newspapers. It also brought together some of the medium's top creators. The opening issue contained 15 continuous stories, including a new SGT Rock saga drawn by the legendary Joe Kubert and written by his own son, Adam; &quot;Metamorpho&quot; by Neil Gaiman and Michael Allred; &quot;Superman&quot; with a script by John Arcudi and art by Lee Bermejo; and stories featuring; Wonder Woman, Kamandi and Batman.\n\nThe new format proved a massive success with the first few issues quickly selling out and the Superman story being reprinted in USA Today. The series ended after 12 issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb18e9324388dd853c0baad6aefaccaa3506f7fc","amp;dn":"Wednesday+Comics+%2801+-+12+%2B+Extras%29+%282009%29+%28Minutemen-The+Trust%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb18e9324388dd853c0baad6aefaccaa3506f7fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,24,233,50,67,136,221,133,60,11,170,214,174,250,204,170,53,6,247,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
