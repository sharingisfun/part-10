Bergman held this film to be one of his most important; in his book Images, he writes: &quot;Today I feel that in Persona ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and later in Cries and Whispers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I had gone as far as I could go. And that in these two instances when working in total freedom, I touched wordless secrets that only the cinema can discover.&quot; He also said that\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAt some time or other, I said that Persona saved my life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that is no exaggeration. If I had not found the strength to make that film, I would probably have been all washed up. One significant point: for the first time I did not care in the least whether the result would be a commercial success...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe film explores an encounter between two women: Elisabet a successful actress who has become mute during a performance of Electra, and Alma (soul in Spanish and Portuguese), the nurse charged with caring for her. Some critics have seen August StrindbergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s play The Stronger as a source of inspiration for Persona. Bergman wrote Persona during nine weeks while recovering from pneumonia. During filming Bergman wanted to call the film A Bit of Cinematography. His producer suggested something more accessible and the title of the film was changed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6bd88ed8c9193475393c1b89d73f8725e267d47","amp;dn":"Persona+-+Ingmar+Bergman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6bd88ed8c9193475393c1b89d73f8725e267d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,189,136,237,140,145,147,71,83,147,193,184,157,115,248,114,94,38,125,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
