It just covers her work at the Hickory label in the early to mid-'60s, leaving her subsequent country-oriented material for the company untouched. Because of its thorough look at her early Hickory years, however, it might be a more preferable listen for pop/rock-oriented fans than the chronologically wider-ranging (though shorter) The Very Best of Sue Thompson on Varese Sarabande, which tagged on a bunch of her duets with Don Gibson. Thompson is most known for her rather novelty-oriented polka-tempoed hits &quot;Norman&quot; and &quot;James (Hold the Ladder Steady),&quot; but in fact much of her output was very much in the orchestrated pop/rock and country field Brenda Lee was ploughing in the same era. You get both sides of the coin on this CD, and the Brenda Lee-like stuff actually holds up better -- the 1961 single &quot;Angel, Angel,&quot; written by the great songwriting team of Boudleaux and Felice Bryant, is perhaps the most accurate Lee sound-alike ever done. Thompson doesn't measure up to Lee, though -- her voice and interpretive skills aren't in the same class, and nor is the material. So this is an inconsistent listen, and too long for non-collectors. But it does have some decent songs, including a few obscure ones by major songwriters like the Bryants, John D. Loudermilk, and Roy Orbison (though the latter's &quot;Bad Boy&quot; hardly rates among his finer moments). Thompson also gets into a strangely more soul-oriented groove on a few of the later cuts -- 1965's &quot;Sweet Hunk of Misery&quot; (an obvious Supremes imitation written by Fame Studios chief Rick Hall), the fairly decent gutsy rocker &quot;It's Break-Up Time,&quot; and Loudermilk's &quot;Paper Tiger.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc138a3599642c4cdca998fc3aba2b151dc72fc","amp;dn":"Sue+Thompson+-+Suzie%3A+The+Hickory+Anthology+1961-1965++%5B2004%5D%5BEA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc138a3599642c4cdca998fc3aba2b151dc72fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,193,56,163,89,150,66,196,205,202,153,143,195,171,162,177,81,220,114,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
