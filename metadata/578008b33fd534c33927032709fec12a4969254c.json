On most selections she is accompanied by her French quintet, but there are also two guest appearances apiece for organist Jimmy Smith and pianist Silver (&quot;Nice's Dream&quot; and &quot;Song for My Father&quot;). Bridgewater uplifts Silver's lyrics, proves to be in prime form, and swings up a storm. Other high points include &quot;Filthy McNasty,&quot; &quot;Doodlin',&quot; and &quot;Blowin' the Blues Away.&quot; A gem. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Permit Me To Introduce You To Yourself\n02 - Nica's Dream\n03 - The Tokyo Blues\n04 - Pretty Eyes\n05 - Saint Vitus Dance\n06 - You Happened My Way\n07 - Soulville\n08 - Filthy McNasty\n09 - Song For My Father\n10 - Doodlin'\n11 - Lonely Woman\n12 - The Jody Grind\n13 - Blowin' The Blues Away\n\nNo .cue file.\nEnjoy and share!
