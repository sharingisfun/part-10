But now the very place that brought them together-the Loggerhead Island Research Institute--is out of funding and will have to shut down. That is, unless the Virals can figure out a way to save it!\n\nSo when Tory learns of an old Charleston legend about a famous she-pirate, Anne Bonney, whose fortune was never found, she can't believe her luck--buried treasure is exactly what she needs to save the Institute on Loggerhead!
