Designed for novices with basic programming skills, Robot Development Using MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Robotics Developer Studio provides clear instructions on developing and operating robots. It includes an extensive array of examples, with corresponding step-by-step tutorials and explanations.\n\nThe first several chapters of the book introduce the development environment of MSRDS, including concurrency and coordination runtime (CCR), decentralized software services (DSS), visual simulation environment (VSE), and the Microsoft Visual Programming Language (MVPL). The text then covers the inputs and outputs to the robot and control logic and describes how MSRDS can be used to control a LEGO robotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hearing and vision. It also presents a real-life example involving a sumo robot contest. The final chapter provides information on related academic courses, websites, and books.\n\nThe top-down approach used in this text helps readers think of a robot as a system rather than an assemblage of parts. Readers gain an understanding of methods for integration, design trade-offs, and teamworkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all essential skills for building robots. The MSRDS codes for all examples are available at http://msrds.caece.net/\nAbout the Author\n\nShih-Chung (Jessy) Kang is an associate professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU). Dr. Kang began using MSRDS on a research project in 2006 before its official launch by Microsoft and now often teaches about robotics using it. He earned his Ph.D. from Stanford University.\n\nWei-Tze (Aries) Chang is a postdoctoral researcher at NTU. Dr. Chang is also an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at Tamkang University. He earned his Ph.D. from NTU.\n\nKai-Yuan Gu is a digital design engineer for the Mighty Power Solutions Corp., where he designs automated products for energy-saving devices and lighting. He earned a masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree from NTU.\n\nHung-Lin Chi is a doctoral student in the Department of Civil Engineering at NTU. He is currently researching the integration of robot-sensing techniques into remote-controlled systems for cranes.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 287 pages\n    * Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 1 edition (June 23, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1439821658\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1439821657","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cdc22107887f7f97743c4cf5c14e3b5e010f618","amp;dn":"Robot+Development+Using+MSRDS%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cdc22107887f7f97743c4cf5c14e3b5e010f618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,220,34,16,120,135,247,249,119,67,196,207,92,20,227,181,224,16,246,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
