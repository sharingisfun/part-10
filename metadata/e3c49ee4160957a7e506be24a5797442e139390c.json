It was written by Nora and Delia Ephron based on the play Parfumerie by MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³. The film is about two letter-writing lovers who are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. An adaptation of Parfumerie was previously made as The Shop Around the Corner, a 1940 film by Ernst Lubitsch and also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime by Robert Z. Leonard starring Judy Garland. You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film. Ephron insists that You've Got Mail was as much about the Upper West Side itself as the characters, highlighting the &quot;small town community&quot; feel that pervades the Upper West Side.[citation needed]\n\nThe name of the film is an example of product placement, based on the trademark greeting that AOL users hear when they receive new e-mail. About one year later, AOL and Time Warner (the entertainment conglomerate that owns Warner Bros. studios, which released this film) announced a corporate merger.[citation needed]\n\nThe film received significant media coverage[citation needed] leading up to its release in anticipation of the romantic coupling of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who had appeared together previously in Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou've Got Mail - Soundtrack 1998\n\n\nYou've Got Mail was a soundtrack released in 1998.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tHarry Nilsson - &quot;The Puppy Song&quot; - 2:43\n2.\tThe Cranberries - &quot;Dreams&quot; - 4:31\n3.\tBobby Darin - &quot;Splish Splash&quot; - 2:12\n4.\tLouis Armstrong - &quot;Dummy Song&quot; - 2:19\n5.\tHarry Nilsson - &quot;Remember&quot; - 4:02\n6.\tRoy Orbison - &quot;Dream&quot; - 2:12\n7.\tBobby Day - &quot;Rockin' Robin&quot; - 2:36\n8.\tRandy Newman - &quot;Lonely at the Top&quot; - 2:32\n9.\tStevie Wonder - &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours&quot; - 2:38\n10.\tSinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor - &quot;I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City&quot; - 3:08\n11.\tHarry Nilsson - &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; - 3:31\n12.\tCarole King - &quot;Anyone At All&quot; - 3:09\n13.\tBilly Williams - &quot;I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter&quot; - 2:08\n14.\tGeorge Fenton - &quot;The 'You've Got Mail' Suite&quot; - 5:36\n15.\tJimmy Durante - &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot; - 3:04\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3c49ee4160957a7e506be24a5797442e139390c","amp;dn":"You%5C%27ve+Got+Mail+-+Soundtrack+1998+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3c49ee4160957a7e506be24a5797442e139390c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,196,158,228,22,9,87,167,229,6,190,36,165,121,116,66,225,57,57,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
