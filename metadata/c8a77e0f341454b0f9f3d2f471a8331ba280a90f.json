It is the most humanist of films, but it asserts that humanism is powerless without politics, just as politics is purposeless without humanism. The last sequence is the most perfect ending in cinema, so broad in implication, so exquisite in form. The reunion of mother and son Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the revelation of human love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is at once the most important thing in the world, and an event insignificant against the panorama of human suffering. The double perspective Ã¢â‚¬â€œ never to see things in isolation, always in context Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is assured by MizoguchiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style, and defines his art. Sansho Dayu is, in Gilbert AdairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words, Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of those films for whose sake the cinema existsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nAlexander Jacoby, Senses Of Cinema.com\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Sansho the Bailiff.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 4.37 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Overall bit rate : 5 037 Kbps\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Bit rate : 4 313 Kbps\n      Width : 960 pixels\n      Height : 720 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : DTS\n      Codec ID : A_DTS\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 560 Kbps / 512 Kbps\n      Language : Japanese\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047445/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047445/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJapanese audio; English and Portuguese subtitles (srt)\n\nRipped and posted at Karagarga by PSiF, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a77e0f341454b0f9f3d2f471a8331ba280a90f","amp;dn":"Sansho+the+Bailiff.1954.720p.BluRay.x264-PSiF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a77e0f341454b0f9f3d2f471a8331ba280a90f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,167,126,15,52,20,84,176,249,243,210,244,113,168,51,27,162,128,169,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
