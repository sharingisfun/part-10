The band name was inspired by an Immortal demo track, &quot;Enslaved in Rot.&quot; After many line-up changes throughout their career, BjÃƒÂ¸rnson and Kjellson are the only remaining original members. By 2004 the line-up solidified with guitarist Arve &quot;Ice Dale&quot; Isdal, drummer Cato Bekkevold, and keyboardist/vocalist Herbrand Larsen.\n\nAnd Led Zeppelin well we all know about them.\n\nAlong with an original version of Immigrant song I was motovated to make this. Give em a listen.\n I like what Enslaved did with the song,and the original is thrown in just to keep it in perspective.\n\nTracks\n\n1.
