More beautiful than ever, Rita Hayworth stars as Terpsichore, the Goddess of Dance. From her perch Up Above, Terpsichore discovers that Broadway producer Danny Miller (Larry Parks) intends to put together a musical satire, lampooning herself and her fellow Greek Gods. Eliciting the aid of Heavenly emissary Mr. Jordan (Roland Culver, taking over from the earlier film's Claude Rains), Terpsichore descends to Earth in human form, landing a role in Miller's play. Through her bewitching influence, Miller agrees to abandon his plans for a satire, transforming his production into a portentiously serious &quot;work of art&quot;-which lays a large and noxious egg with the opening-night crowd. Somehow, our ethereal heroine manages to set things right, but there's still one nagging problem: Will she, a goddess, ever be permitted to fall in love with a mere mortal like Miller? Repeating their Here Comes Mr. Jordan roles, James Gleason and Edward Everett Horton appear respectively as the eternally flustered Max Corkle (formerly a fight promoter, now a theatrical agent) and the pompous, rule-bound Heavenly messenger #7013. Silly but immensely entertaining, Down to Earth was remade as the sillier but decidedly less entertaining Xanadu in 1980. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039337/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039337/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nAlexander Hall\n\n\n\n        Rita Hayworth\t ... \tTerpsichore / Kitty Pendleton\n\tLarry Parks\t... \tDanny Miller\n\tMarc Platt\t... \tEddie\n\tRoland Culver\t... \tMr. Jordan\n\tJames Gleason\t... \tMax Corkle\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:40:48\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 656x496  4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1940 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,25 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 135 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e160a1bfcea08f7af9c4ced96cba56af3dc9df6","amp;dn":"Down+To+Earth+%281947%29+Rita+Hayworth+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e160a1bfcea08f7af9c4ced96cba56af3dc9df6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,22,10,27,252,234,8,247,175,156,76,237,150,203,165,106,243,220,157,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
