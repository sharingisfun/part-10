There are many Ska influences on the album, but the band dabbles in all sorts of musical genres on One Step Beyond, creating their own unique brand of Pop\r\nHistory will rightly remember Madness as one of Britainâ€™s greatest ever singles groups, but itâ€™s on their albums that the Nutty Boys fully displayed their kaleidoscopic mastery of pop.\r\n\r\nTheir first â€“ reissued to celebrate its 30th anniversary, and including a second disc of B sides, Peel Sessions, videos and rarities â€“ One Step Beyondâ€¦ saw Madness commit to tape a raucous live show that had already won them a committed following across the pubs of their native north London.\r\n\r\nTheir debut single The Prince, originally released on Two-Tone (and rerecorded here, with an excellent dubby coda and extended sax solo from Lee â€˜Kixâ€™ Thompson), placed the septet firmly alongside kindred ska-revival spirits like The Specials. But Madness had other strings to their bow, their sound a Doc Marten-ed hybrid of soul, rockabilly, music hall, 60s pop, British sitcom and whatever else the groupâ€™s seven performer/songwriters had happened upon up â€˜til that point. Indeed, Madnessâ€™s eclecticism soon became their trademark, along with their wildly exuberant personalities, Mike Barsonâ€™s thunderous piano chords, Thompsonâ€™s squawking sax, Chris Foremanâ€™s genre-hopping guitar heroics (twanging like Dick Dale in Trenchtown on The Prince, chiming like The Byrds on Bed &amp; Breakfast Man), and the droll delivery of frontman Suggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt times, One Step Beyondâ€¦ seems so wild a jamboree of song that the whole shebang should just collapse into chaos. But thanks to the able and whip-smart work of production duo Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley â€“ collectively, the George Martin to the Maddiesâ€™ Beatles â€“ and the abundant energy and charisma of the group in their early prime, its chaotic carnival proved a triumph. And while later albums saw the groupâ€™s songwriting skills further blossom and mature, the vaudevillian nuttiness of their debut set hasnâ€™t diminished over the decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
