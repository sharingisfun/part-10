The event comprised two concerts on a circus stage and included such acts as The Who, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, and Jethro Tull. John Lennon and his fiancee Yoko Ono performed as part of a supergroup called The Dirty Mac, along with Eric Clapton, Mitch Mitchell, and Keith Richards. It was originally meant to be aired on the BBC, but the Rolling Stones withheld it because they were unhappy with their performance.\n\nThe Stones contended that they withheld the film's release due to their substandard performance, because they had taken the stage early in the morning and were clearly exhausted. Many others believe that the true reason for not releasing the video was that The Who, who were fresh off a concert tour, upstaged the Stones on their own production.[ The Stones had not toured recently, and were not in top playing condition to match The Who.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb151/bonzi23/Front.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb151/bonzi23/Front.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n   1. &quot;Mick Jagger's Introduction of Rock and Roll Circus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:25\n   2. &quot;Entry Of The Gladiators&quot; (Julius FuÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­k) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:55\n   3. &quot;Mick Jagger's Introduction of Jethro Tull&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:11\n   4. &quot;Song For Jeffrey&quot; (Ian Anderson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n          * Suonata dai Jethro Tull\n   5. &quot;Keith Richards's introduction of The Who&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:07\n   6. &quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot; (Pete Townshend) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:33\n          * Suonata dagli Who\n   7. &quot;Over The Waves&quot; (Juventino Rosas) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:45\n   8. &quot;Ain't That A Lot Of Love&quot; (Homer Banks/Willia Dean Parker) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n          * Suonata da Taj Mahal\n   9. &quot;Charlie Watts's Introduction of Marianne Faithfull&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:06\n  10. &quot;Something Better (Gerry Goffin/Barry Mann) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n          * Cantata da Marianne Faithfull\n  11. &quot;Mick Jagger's and John Lennon's Introduction of The Dirty Mac&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:05\n  12. &quot;Yer Blues (Lennon/McCartney) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n          * Suonata dai The Dirty Mac\n  13. &quot;Whole Lotta Yoko&quot; (Yoko Ono) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n          * Suonata da Yoko Ono e Ivry Gitlis con i The Dirty Mac\n  14. &quot;John Lennon's Introduction of The Rolling Stones&quot;/&quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 (Jagger/Richards)\n  15. &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59 (Jagger/Richards)\n  16. &quot;No Expectations&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13 (Jagger/Richards)\n  17. &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24 (Jagger/Richards)\n  18. &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:49 (Jagger/Richards)\n  19. &quot;Salt Of The Earth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57 (Jagger/Richards)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6670020d6c54e4e1a26d668605c717082d7d2f17","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Rock+And+Roll+Circus+%5BDVD9+HQ+Audio+-+MultiSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6670020d6c54e4e1a26d668605c717082d7d2f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,112,2,13,108,84,228,225,162,109,102,134,5,199,23,8,45,125,47,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
