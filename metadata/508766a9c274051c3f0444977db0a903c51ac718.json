The series began on the web on TheWB.com with ten episodes, roughly five minutes in length, all of which premiered on December 8, 2008. Adult Swim picked up the rights to the show in 2009 and began airing episodes in 2010.\n\nThe storyline centers on the staff of Childrens Hospital, a hospital for children named after a Dr. Childrens. The hospital sporadically (and usually without reason) is mentioned as being located within Brazil, despite making virtually no effort to conceal that the series is shot in Los Angeles, California. Corddry is part of an ensemble cast portraying the hospital's doctors, which also includes Lake Bell, Erinn Hayes, Rob Huebel, Ken Marino and Megan Mullally. Malin ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦kerman and Henry Winkler joined the cast for season two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508766a9c274051c3f0444977db0a903c51ac718","amp;dn":"Childrens+Hospital+-+Seasons+1%2B2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508766a9c274051c3f0444977db0a903c51ac718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,135,102,169,194,116,5,28,63,4,68,151,125,176,169,3,197,26,199,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
