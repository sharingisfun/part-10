The long-held picture of German women holding down the home front during the war, as loyal wives and cheerleaders for the Fuhrer, pales in comparison to LowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incisive case for the massive complicity, and worse, of the 500,000 young German women she places, for the first time, directly in the killing fields of the expanding Reich.\n\n HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Furies builds a fascinating and convincing picture of a morally Ã¢â‚¬Å“lost generationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of young women, born into a defeated, tumultuous postÃ¢â‚¬â€œWorld War I Germany, and then swept up in the nationalistic fervor of the Nazi movementÃ¢â‚¬â€a twisted political awakening that turned to genocide. These young womenÃ¢â‚¬â€nurses, teachers, secretaries, wives, and mistressesÃ¢â‚¬â€saw the emerging Nazi empire as a kind of Ã¢â‚¬Å“wild eastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of career and matrimonial opportunity, and yet could not have imagined what they would witness and do there. Lower, drawing on twenty years of archival and field work on the Holocaust, access to post-Soviet documents, and interviews with German witnesses, presents overwhelming evidence that these women were more than Ã¢â‚¬Å“desk murderersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or comforters of murderous German men: that they went on Ã¢â‚¬Å“shopping spreesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for Jewish-owned goods and also brutalized Jews in the ghettos of Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus; that they were present at killing-field picnics, not only providing refreshment but also taking their turn at the mass shooting. And Lower uncovers the stories, perhaps most horrific, of SS wives with children of their own, whose female brutality is as chilling as any in history.\n\n HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Furies will challenge our deepest beliefs: genocide is womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business too, and the evidence can be hidden for seventy years.\n\n\n2013 epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c36c77b75ae600f8fab5dcaafb924a2f6c936d4d","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Furies%3A+German+Women+in+the+Nazi+Killing+Fields+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c36c77b75ae600f8fab5dcaafb924a2f6c936d4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,108,119,183,90,230,0,248,250,181,220,170,251,146,74,47,108,147,109,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
