Recorded over a six month period in 1970/71 at Bearsville, In My Own Time was Dalton's only fully planned and realized studio album. The material was carefully selected and crafted for her by producer/musician Harvey Brooks, the Renaissance man of rock-jazz who played bass on Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited and Miles' Bitches Brew. It features ten songs that reflected Dalton's incredible ability to break just about anybody's heart - from her spectral evocation of Joe Tate's One Night of Love, to the dark tragedy of the traditional Katie Cruel. Known as a great interpreter of choice material, Dalton could master both country and soul genres with hauntingly pining covers of George Jones' Take Me and Holland-Dozier Holland's How Sweet It Is.
