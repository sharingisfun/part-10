And\nit has retained its energy. And there&amp;#039;s a lot to be said\nfor that, I think.&quot;\n\nDave Sardy produced the new album which was recorded at\nLondon&amp;#039;s Abbey Road studios and mixed in Los Angeles.\n\nGallagher described the music as &quot;more hypnotic, more\ndriving&quot; than previous records.\n\nThe band, which has sold an estimated 50 million albums\nworldwide, will release the new record globally on its\nown Big Brother record label for the first time.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05bea645b0b8fdcbaafa4e22214667c3c9a4db5d","amp;dn":"Oasis-Dig_Out_Your_Soul-2008-OASiS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05bea645b0b8fdcbaafa4e22214667c3c9a4db5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,190,166,69,176,184,253,203,170,250,78,34,33,70,103,195,201,164,219,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
