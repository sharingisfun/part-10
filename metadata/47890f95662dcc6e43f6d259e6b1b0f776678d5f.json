This is the ultimate book on how to stay alive-based on the principal of keeping the body's core temperature at a lively 98.6 degrees.\n\nIn his entertaining and informative style, Cody stresses that a human can live without food for weeks and without water for about three days or so. But if the body's core temperature dips much below or above the 98.6 degree mark, a person can literally die within hours. It is a concept that many don't take seriously or even consider, but knowing what to do to maintain a safe core temperature when lost in a blizzard or in the desert could save your life. Lundin delivers the message with wit, rebellious humor, and plenty of backcountry expertise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47890f95662dcc6e43f6d259e6b1b0f776678d5f","amp;dn":"98.6+Degrees+-+The+Art+of+Keeping+Your+Ass+alive+-+Cody+Lundin.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47890f95662dcc6e43f6d259e6b1b0f776678d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,137,15,149,102,45,204,110,67,246,210,89,230,177,176,247,118,103,141,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
