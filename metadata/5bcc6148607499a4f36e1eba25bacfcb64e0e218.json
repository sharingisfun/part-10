Hayashi (Pergamon, 1967).pdf\r\n\r\nWenner-Gren Center International Symposium Series, Volume 8: Olfaction and Taste II covers the proceedings of the Second International Symposium, held in Tokyo, Japan on September 1965. \r\nThis book is composed of 53 chapters that bring together theoretical and experimental studies on the chemoreception in insects, other invertebrates and vertebrates, from fishes to the monkey, and their significance in delineating human olfaction and taste. Other chapters deal with the study of the chemoreceptive organs and their related parts of the nervous system, which will be helpful in the analysis of the function of other sensory organs and their neural connections. This book also discusses the evidence that the epithelium of the front of the tongue has other properties than that of the back of the tongue as far as the conversion of its cells into gustatory cells is concerned under the influence of the outgrowing gustatory nerve fibers. The remaining chapters describe the transmission and decoding of coded information from the receptors in the central nervous system. \r\nThis book is of value to biologists, physiologists, and research workers who are interested in the complex mechanism of olfaction and taste","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bcc6148607499a4f36e1eba25bacfcb64e0e218","amp;dn":"Olfaction+and+Taste+II+-+T.+Hayashi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bcc6148607499a4f36e1eba25bacfcb64e0e218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,204,97,72,96,116,153,164,243,110,30,186,37,186,207,203,100,224,226,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
