This is a great book that illustrates the Zionist backboning of Millenialist Christian movements in the early 1900s. Today the Jehovah's Witnesses are one of the most dangerous religious cults around. Their policies have killed many people and they have brainwashed and stolen the minds of millions.\n\nBackground\nOnce there was a Jewish family whose name was Roessel. They lived in early 17th century Germany. They moved to a country called Scotland. There they respelled the name Russell. They took on ways of their new homeland. The English tried to settle Protestants from Scotland and Ireland in order to the control the Irish.\n\nThat C.T. RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s family was in Scotland for a period, and also from the German states which seem to be a hotbed for Jewish Satanism (Bavarian Illuminati) may be only a coincidence and then again it might be a clue to understanding the origins of the Watchtower Society.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Church which jealously guards its turf has repeatedly accused the JehovahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Witnesses of being financed by the agents of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½International Zionism.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (New York Times, June 4, 1970 cf. Awake! Nov. 22 1976, p. 23)\n\nRussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s WT Society was financed by some heavyweights. The history of the WT Society gives evidence that the power to bring in a One-World New Order to accomplish certain goals. Sadly, the JWs, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½in the trenchesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ havenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t known how they have been used.\n\nJewish Banking Firms/Families\nJ.P. Morgan, the RothschildÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s (Illuminist Jews) representative in the United States, set up a trust fund to unite various Christian denominations. Russell praises this in his Jan. 1, 1911 WT. pp.1-4 (WTR p.4735), ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Mr. MorganÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s well-known business capacity, exhibited in connection with financial trusts, encourages many to believe that he will accomplish the desired end in connection with the movement. More and more all denominations are craving a religious trust of federation and are becoming more and more willing to sacrifice doctrines and principles formerly held dear, in order to accomplish this federation.\n\nJ.P. MorganÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s trust fund was set up to pay denominations to federate, and C.T. Russell promoted this ecumenical movement. Russell saw it as fulfillment of scripture.\n\nOn pages 51-52 in my 6/1//ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½93 newsletter (Newsletter From a Christian Ministry) I copied two newspaper articles from Germany (Der Morgen 5/18/ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½23) back in 1923 where a letter from a Freemason discloses how they are financing the Watchtower SocietyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s work. Another source of information on the eliteÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s connections to the WT Society is a colleague in the Netherlands, Robin de Ruiter, who wrote ?Precaucion! Testigos de Jehova, which was published in Spanish. For Spanish readers who want an in-depth overview of what is wrong with the Watchtower Society, this is the book to get. Robin de Ruiter has been researching the connections between Kuhn, Loeb, &amp; Co (Jewish banking firm), the Warburgs (Jewish Banking family), and the Watchtower Society.\n\nThere are whole layers of secret interactions between the Illuminati and the WatchtowerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s key men. Darrell Talmage who worked in the WatchtowerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Law Office which Covington ran, personally in the 1950-53 period witnessed that large sums of money were coming to the Watchtower Society secretly, although he wasnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t able to find out where they came from.\n\nThe WT Society Collaborates With Jewish Groups\nAfter RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s death, and while Rutherford, the second WT president was confined in a Federal Penitentiary, the WT headquarters shifted back from Brooklyn to Pittsburgh. The Watchtower magazine on Sept.1, 1918 printed a revealing letter from the men in Pittsburgh who were running the Watchtower Society. The letter equates the Watchtower Society with the Jewish Zionist movement. Whether the two are actually the same or not, it is evident from this article, that the Watchtower leaders were not concerned that the Society and the Zionist movement be identified together.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½On Saturday and Sunday we had the pleasure of hearing our dear Brother Thorn expound the further unfolding of GodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s plan. He spoke of the restoration of the Jews to their land, called the attention so the significance of their Passover Supper coming the day in the history of our Society. Note how in this wonderful sequence of events the ceremonial and governmental features of the movements effected have been kept separate and distinct. This Congress accomplished more than did the former twenty Zionist conventions put togetherÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (The Watchtower 1 Sept ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 18, p.275)\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦Russell interviewed a large number of Jewish notables and leaders who came to visit him at the central offices of the Witnesses in Brooklyn.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\n\nSome like the Jewish editor of the Boston Jewish Advocate, Jacob de Haas, a Hasidic Jew and prominent member of the Munich Zionist meeting on Aug. 25, 1897, felt Russell had identical religious beliefs to his.\n\nAnother Jew, Raymond G. Jolly, states about his meeting with Russell, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½I was very much impressed with this godly manÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ So much so that Jolly joined RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s movement along with many other Jews. Numerous Jews would become prominent figures in the Watchtower Society including Paul S.L. Johnson, John J. Hoefle, and Olin R. Moyle. Many with Jewish heritage would also find RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s movement attractive such as Frederick Franz and Nathan Knorr. Early lists of Bible Students show that people of Jewish heritage may have made up to 20 percent of RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s movement. This author gives that figure, not as a statistic, but as one of the many factors that lead to him to conclude that Jews joined Russell faster than the general population. (Another movement during this same time period which started out as 100% Jewish and also was supported by the Order of the BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith was Freud &amp; Psycho Analysis. David BakanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s book Sigmund Freud and the Jewish Mystical Tradition documents some of the Cabalistic/occult roots to Pyscho-Analysis. Freud was a BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith member.)\n\nJews referred to Russell as a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½great friend of the Jewish people.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ And Russell did love them, even those who were secular humanists, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½I feel great sympathy for the Jews in their unbeliefÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (Russell C.T. Jewish Hopes ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Jerusalem Restoration Prospects, Pittsburgh PA 1910.)\nOne of the undeniable leaders of the Jewish people are the Rothchilds. Pastor Russell wrote the Rothschilds several letters. The connections that Charles T. Russell, his family, and his organization had with the Rothschilds , the Morgans, and other Illuminati figures is just part of the overwhelming circumstantial evidence that Charles T. Russell was connected to the Illuminati.\n\nThe BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith Finances Russell\nEdith Star Miller, a researcher into international politics and the causes of social unrest, managed to position herself amongst various important people. By rubbing shoulders with the right people she came upon ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½irrefutable evidenceÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ of a bewildering drama of a conspiracy between various organizations. She found out that BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith was responsible for getting Russell started.\n\nFrank Goldman, both a member of the Order (as BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith is known) and a Mason, escorted Pastor Russell by car to the Hippodrome for RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s two hour talk. Jewish financiers had by the way rented the Hippodrome for Russell. After Russell finished his talk, the Zionist anthem ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Rosh HashanahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ was played. Frank Goldman went on to become the President of BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith.\n\nInterestingly, the BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith points out in their Los Angeles BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith Messenger(Jan 15, 1971) their close affinity, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Jews themselves are JehovahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Witnesses. In due time, according to prophecy, Jerusalem will be the capital of the world and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, and other ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ancient WorthiesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ will be resurrected and form the nucleus of GodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Kingdom on earth. This was the understanding of Pastor Russell from his studies of the prophecies, and he so taught during his long ministry.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\n\nThe Watchtower Society distributed a Yiddish periodical Di Stimme (The Voice) all over the world. (WT Jan. 1, 1911 WTR p. 4355) They especially attempted to place it in Russia, to motivate Russian Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Because the paper was ostensibly Christian its distribution came under less restrictions than Jewish literature. (Nice cover to bring Jewish propaganda to Bolshevik run Russia)\n\nThe Watchtower Society offered to supply Di Stimme periodical to anyone ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½in any quantity-free.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (WT Jan.1 1911, p.19 WTR p.4742) There seems to have been no bottom line to the financial backing of the WT Society.\n\nThe same year that the offer was made to supply the Yiddish paper to anyone ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½in any quantityÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½free,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the WT SocietyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s account books claimed a $22,415.93 deficit. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½We doubt not this indebtedness will soon be cancelled; nevertheless the fact that it is nearly double the shortage of last year cautions us that we must to some extent put on the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½brakes.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (WTR 1911, p.4936)\n\nSo how does the Society show caution and put on the brakes? Does it stop printing and distributing millions of pieces of free Zionist literature? No. They have subtly bilked their readers for more donations, but the pace of the free giveaway of the Zionist literature doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t abate. The reason for this is given away in the WT of Jan,1, 1911, p.4 which quietly reveals that funding came from Jewish sources. The distribution of Di Stimme was aided ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦by Jewish Journals interested in the messageÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\n\nSecret backers have always been the secret to RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s success. In 1882, Russell tells readers, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦a brother who has already contributed largely guarantees any debts incurred, to the amount of one thousand dollars in excess of receipts.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\n\nAlthough there are reports of anonymous donations every now and then of the amounts like $9,000 and $1,000, the real underwriting must have been almost a blank check when one examines the WT Societies activities.\n\nFurther, the ease with which Russell visits, works with, and writes Jewish leaders indicates a close relationship.\n\nEvidence of RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Jewish Help Stands In Court\nIsnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t the evidence that the BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith helped RussellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Watchtower Society circumstantical? It wouldnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t hold up in court would it?\nIndeed, it has held up in court.\n\nA Swiss physician, Dr. Fehrmann, at a public meeting on Jan. 21, 1924 upset some people by asserting the BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith and the International Jews had contributed large sums to the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ernst Bibel ForscherÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (that is in Swiss German the Earnest Bible Students which was the name the RussellitesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½that is the Internationla Bible Students, the followers of the Watchtower SocietyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½were know as.) R.G. Binkele of Zurich charged Dr. Fehrmann with slander on this particular point, and the Dr. in a libel court of law successfully defended this statement.\n\nDr. Fehrmann brought forth a number of proofs. One letter entered as evidence was a Masonic letter from high Masonic sources dated 27 December, 1922. The letter was of unquestionable genuiness and stated, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½We give them (the Earnest Bible Students), in the usual indirect ways, much money through a number of brothers, who during the war made a pile. It wonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t hurt their fat pocket books. They are Jews.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\n\nZionist James P. Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb, &amp; Co. told the US Senate that we were going to get a one-world-government, whether we liked it or not. The only question is, whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent. Another member of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. the Jewish leagel officer Louis Marshall said, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Zionism is but an incident of a far-reaching plan.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Russell was fully aware that the Declaration of Independence of the Zionist State (published in the Jewish World, Feb. 9, 1882) said ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The great ideal of Judaism isÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦that the whole world shall be imbued with Jewish teaching, and that in a Universal Brotherhood of nations-a greater Judaism in fact-all separate races and religions shall disappear.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Judaism today (earlier aka Pharisaism, aka Babylonian occultism) would like to be world-wide and is promoting a New Age movement based on ancient Babylonian occultism.\n\n\nMore Connections to Jewish Banking\nIf suspicions are worth mentioning, I suspect that the Watchtower Society, which does business with Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, may play some money laundering role. They would be the perfect cover, and all their financial records have been extremely secret for most of this century.\n\nNot only are they majority of Governing Body members of Jewish heritage, but some of the Society leaders hobnob with some of the financial Jewish elite. A couple of examples that were not in my Be Wise As Serpents book along this lune are as follows. Anton Koerber bought his way into the Watchtower Society hierarchy. He gave the WT. Soc. President a Cadillac. He sent a donation for $2,000 to The Dawn, a splinter group from the WT, and requested a meeting with their trustees. He tried to get this splinter group to establish them into an organization like the Watchtower Society which they rejected. In 1953, in appreciation for his money, the WT Society made Anton Koerber chairman of the International Convention at Yankee Stadium. The parents of S.S. Kresge, who set up the department stores by that name, were friends of Pastor Russell and were International Bible Students (the old name for JehovahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Witness). S.S. KresgeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s President Charles B. Van Dusen, was a 33rd degree Freemason.\n\nPerhaps the second most vital position of the WT Society was the London office, as it helped with the European and Commonwealth work. Paul S.L. Johnson, a Jew, had been assigned this position by Russell. Johnson had for some time thought Russell had selected him to succeed, and a majority of the Directors thought so to. For a while the London office and British Guinea were loyal to Johnson rather than Rutherford. But Rutherford tricked the law into believing that the four Directors who opposed him were illegal, and forced their dismissal. Then he had the upper hand.\n\nRutherford, Franz, Freemasonry, Jewish Bankers, and Rhodes Scholarship\nIt is hard to picture Rutherford as a Mason, He was so narrow-minded and had so many prejudices that it isnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t likely that he would have been asked or would have cared to join. Nonetheless it would not be beyond the realm of possibility. One conspiracy writer has written that he was. Rutherford had a friend in the US Senate, German-born Jew from Cumberland, MD named George Louis Wellington, who also was a banker and president of Edison Electric Illuminating Co. (The Cyclopaedia of American Biography, p.545) If birds of a feather flock together, then it is possible that Rutherford, who had friends such as Sen. Wellington, might have been a Freemason, in spite of his anti-Masonic diatribes in the Watchtower. (It is also possible that Rutherford was a Zionist too.)\n\nWas Paul Johnson slated by the BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith (Jewish Masonic Lodge) to take over the Watchtower Society? Was Rutherford and his close henchmen tried on sedition, because they upset the plans of the BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nai BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rith to put their man in? Did Rutherford strike a deal at some point with the Powers? Circumstantial evidence points to Rutherford agreeing to some kind of working relationship with the Conspiracy. Or did the One-World-Government planners support both sides of the struggle for power over the Watchtower Society?\n\nAlso of great significance is Frederick FranzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s claim that he was offered the Rhodes Scholarship (offered to potential Illuminati leader elites) in 1914. but that he turned it down to go into the Watchtower Society. This author has the court transcripts from Scotland where Franz under oath states this. The transcripts are of the Douglas Walsh trial and can be ordered through the author if someone really wants to read about the Watchtower leaders under interrogation. Much ballyhoo was made by Christians that Franz must have lied because the Rhodes Scholarship Trust does not admit having records showing him having been selected. But that is not what Franz claimed. He only claimed they contacted him and offered it to him.\n\nIt is reasonable to believe the Rhodes Scholarship Trust would interview prospective candidates before going public with the selection process. As the Rhodes Scholarship is one way into the Illuminati , they also do not give out more information than they like to the public, so it is no wonder they donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t have any recollection of Franz. Rhodes Scholarships are given out to teach men how to bring in a One-World-Government. Why did they want to select Frederick William Franz? Furthermore, there is another Governing Board member of the JehovahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Witnesses, Lloyd Berry, who did get the Rhodes Scholarship and its training, and who survived the death of Franz.\n\n\nWhy Would Jews Support The Christian Pastor Russell?\nObviously today the Watchtower Society (Jehovah's Witness) would be a good investment. And for someone who was trying to destroy the power of Christianity, the WT Society is very powerful investment. The Society targets minorities and the lower classes for recruitment, so it isn't quite the threat to someone in the power structure. But what about then, in Charles T. Russell's day?\n\nNot much attention has been given this question.\n\nThe prominent Jew, Jeane Kirkpatric, who was the U.S.'s ambassador to the UN described Russell's Zionism as &quot;a neglected man.&quot; Such praise is significant. Kirkpatric is a CFR member, in favor of a One-World-State, and is often praised in the CIA's NATIONAL REVIEW. Her husband was involved in intelligence in key operations.\n\nPastor Charles T. Russell (Jehovah's Witness Founder) preached Judaism with a veneer of Christianity. Perhaps no one else has more successfully pass of Jewish thoughts as Christian, than C.T. Russell.\n\nConsider what Russell taught. Russell said:\n\n1.The Jews would be the principal rulers during the millenium.\n2.That the nations of the world would have to become Jews during the Millenium.\n3.That God would bless the world through the Jewish people.\n4. Russell advised the Jews to go to their Rabbis to learn how to protect themselves from Christian teachings.\n5.Russell told Christians they should stop trying to convert the Jews, for it was against God's will to convert them.\n6.and that it was God's will for Jews to remain Jews..\n7. Russell promoted Zionism, &amp; often reprinted articles from leading Jews in the WT.\nWhat does Russell do for Christianity.\nEverything sacred to Christianity is attacked.\n8.Russell says the Messiah is a collection of Jews, with maybe a few Gentiles included.\n9. Russell says the Protestant and Catholic Bibles are inaccurate, and that only he could understand the Bible. The WT Society would carry this to its logical conclusion, they produced their own Bible called the New World Translation, which true to its makers preconceived ideas, tries to erase the deity of Jesus Christ.\n10. Christians are the most guilty and horrible people on earth.\n11. God has not tried to save the world of mankind, but wants the world to join Judaism.\n\nIf Russell had labelled himself a Jew, he never would have been listened to by the Christians. But by labelling himself the most orthodox of Christians, many Christians bought into his message, which was the identical message some of th emost rabidly anti-Christian Jews have advocated for years.\n\nRussell Says The Jews Are Superior Morally and Intellectually\n\nRussell preached that the Jews are superior to Christians morally and intellectually. &quot;Judged in this broad, general way, who will dispute that the twelve million Jews are not in advance of the average Christendom intellecually and morally?&quot; C.T. Russell.\n\nThat's quite appropriate for a man who has turned the Messiah basically into a collection of Jews. Russell's hatred for Christianity could serve the interests of any group bent on Christendom's destruction.\n\nThe WT Society vilifies Christianity in the fasion the Talmud does. &quot;...with great pomp and glory that unholy system rides upon the backs of peoples. Without the support of the common peoples that wicked system called 'Christendom' could not survive...instead of heeding the message...those constituting the unholy alliance...continue to oppress.... The doom of 'organized Christianity&quot; or Babylon is sealed.&quot; (Watchtower Magazine 10/15/27 p.312 cf. Babylon the Great, p. 559 and a host of otherWT references.)\n\nIn contrast, the WT Society doesn't attack the modern Jewish religion, or its adherents, except with mild jabs.\n\n&quot;But what grieves me today is the large scale voluntary assimilation (into Christian society) especially among Jewish Youths,&quot; states a modern day follower of Russell, Bible Student Kenneth W. Rawson.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated:\n\nFreemasonry and Judaism: The Secret Powers Behind Revolution &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4616984/Freemasonry_and_Judaism__-_Powers_Behind_Revolution_-_Poncins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4616984/Freemasonry_and_Judaism__-_Powers_Behind_Revolution_-_Poncins&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOccult Theocrasy - Lady Queenborough Edith Star Miller  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4406122/Occult_Theocrasy_-_Lady_Queenborough_Edith_Star_Miller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4406122/Occult_Theocrasy_-_Lady_Queenborough_Edith_Star_Miller&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBorn in Blood - The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry - Robinson  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4355265/Born_in_Blood_-_The_Lost_Secrets_of_Freemasonry_-_Robinson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4355265/Born_in_Blood_-_The_Lost_Secrets_of_Freemasonry_-_Robinson&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Hidden Power Behind Freemasonry - Gordon &quot;Jack&quot; Mohr  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4333326/The_Hidden_Power_Behind_Freemasonry_-_Gordon_Jack_Mohr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4333326/The_Hidden_Power_Behind_Freemasonry_-_Gordon_Jack_Mohr&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Deadly Deception - Jim Shaw - (Masonic Defector)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5031277&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5031277&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy public URL: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy RSS feed: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cd845e6d85e2cbc0242c66a5383204152a79a1a","amp;dn":"The+Watchtower+and+the+Masons+-+Fritz+Springmeier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cd845e6d85e2cbc0242c66a5383204152a79a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,216,69,230,216,94,44,188,2,66,198,106,83,131,32,65,82,167,154,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
