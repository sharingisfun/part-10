Even while playing nothing but woodwinds, Kirk easily sidesteps the usual pitfalls of the all-woodwinds album, most often a certain limp treacliness. This is due in large part to an undeniably funky backing trio powered by the brilliant organist Jack McDuff, but Kirk's own playing is as meaty and impassioned as ever. He opens the set with whirlwind solos on &quot;Three for Dizzy&quot; and continues with the powerful title track and &quot;Funk Underneath,&quot; a track showcasing bassist Joe Benjamin and drummer Arthur Taylor that forecasts the soul jazz of the late '60s. Even an utterly unironic cover of &quot;The Skater's Waltz&quot; escapes lightweightness.\n\nRahsaan Roland Kirk (1936-1977) was a blind American jazz saxophonist, perhaps best known for his ability to play more than one saxophone at once. \n\nKirk was born Ronald Kirk on 7th August 1936, in Columbus, Ohio, but felt compelled by a dream to transpose two letters in his first name to make Roland. After another dream in about 1970 he added Rahsaan to his name.\n\nHis playing was generally rooted in soul jazz or hard bop, but KirkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s encyclopedic knowledge of jazz history allowed him to draw convincingly on any element of the musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history, from ragtime to swing and free jazz. Kirk also regularly explored classical and pop music.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 &quot;Three For Dizzy&quot; 5:11\n02 &quot;Makin' Whoopee&quot; 5:07\n03 &quot;Funk Underneath&quot; 6:15\n04 &quot;Kirk's Work&quot; 3:54\n05 &quot;Doin' The Sixty-Eight&quot; 4:20\n06 &quot;Too Late Now&quot; 3:52\n07 &quot;Skater's Waltz&quot; 4:23\n\nRecorded in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on July 11, 1961.\nOriginally released on Prestige (7210)\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nRoland Kirk (tenor sax, manzello, strich, flute, siren); \nJack McDuff (Hammond organ); \nJoe Benjamin (bass); \nArthur Taylor (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58327a2fa119906a38825a41eb53447709bd024","amp;dn":"Roland+Kirk++Kirk%5C%27s+Work%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58327a2fa119906a38825a41eb53447709bd024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,131,39,162,250,17,153,6,163,136,37,164,30,181,52,71,112,155,208,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
