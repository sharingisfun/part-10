For three years (1998-2001) Pierre Carles followed Pierre Bourdieu, a major sociologist, working to have his research understood and people prompted to action. Sociology is a fighting sport, not an intellectual technical tool for the elite to validate their choices. People need sociology to understand the growing inequalities and fire back, find their way out of the all-economic fatalism.
