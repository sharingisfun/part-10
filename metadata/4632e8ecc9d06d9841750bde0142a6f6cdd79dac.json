According to a government source, 50 percent of American adults identified themselves as &quot;regular drinkers&quot; (having at least 12 drinks in the past year).\n\nThis encyclopedia presents an overview of the entire history of alcohol in America from the first colonies to present day, focusing on the often-marginalized and pop culture aspects of alcohol use and misuse. Entries illuminate topics such as the favorite alcoholic beverages in America; how they are manufactured; the role of alcohol in everyday life, special events, and across history; the impacts of alcohol consumption on society and health; and much more. Connections and influences from outside the United States are also considered for some topics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4632e8ecc9d06d9841750bde0142a6f6cdd79dac","amp;dn":"Alcohol+In+Popular+Culture+-+An+Encyclopedia.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4632e8ecc9d06d9841750bde0142a6f6cdd79dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,50,232,236,201,208,109,152,65,117,11,222,1,66,166,246,205,215,157,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
