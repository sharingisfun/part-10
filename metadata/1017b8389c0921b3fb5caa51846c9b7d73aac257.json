The latter style could be pinpointed to the 1970 release Band of Gypsys, a live recording which saw Hendrix hook up with old pals Billy Cox (guitar) and Buddy Miles (drums), and shy away from the pyrotechnics of his early days in favor of heavy jamming. Thirty-six years after the release of the Band of Gypsys' lone album comes a follow-up, Band of Gypsys Return, on which Hendrix's shoes are filled by such players as Eric Gales, Kid Rock's Kenny Olson, and Guitar World Magazine's Andy Aledort, among others. Comprised of both studio and live recordings, several Hendrix classics are revisited, as well as a pair of tunes penned by Cox for Jimmy Stewart (aka Buzzard), who was a musical influence on Hendrix and Cox (according to Cox's liner notes). For the most part, the renditions of the Hendrix classics follow the original versions closely -- especially Aledort's fine job of re-creating the long-and-winding solos of &quot;Machine Gun,&quot; as well as Olson tackling &quot;Stone Free.&quot; But elsewhere, tracks like &quot;Manic Depression&quot; get a significant overhauling, and the two aforementioned Stewart tribute tracks, &quot;You've Got the Best in Town&quot; and &quot;Let Your Word Be Your Bond&quot; fit in well. As evidenced by Band of Gypsys Return, Cox and Miles still make up one hell of a rhythm section. \n\nTRACKLIST\n\n1.POWER OF SOUL (7:23)\nBilly Cox: Bass &amp; Backing Vocals\nBuddy Miles: Drums &amp; Vocals\nAndy Aledort: Guitar\nSheldon Reynolds: Backing Vocals[/color]\nRecorded at Clinton Recording Studios, New York, NY\n\n2.MACHINE GUN (12:23)\nBilly Cox: Bass &amp; Backing Vocals\nBuddy Miles: Drums &amp; Vocals\nAndy Aledort: Guitar\nSheldon Reynolds: Backing Vocals\nRecorded at Clinton Recording Studios, New York, NY\n\n3.MANIC DEPRESSION (5:03)\n[color=lime]Buddy Miles: Vocals\nHenri Brown: Bass\nMatt Frenette: Drums\nRick 'Hendrix'4.Guitar\nJoe Bashorun: Keyboards:\nRecorded at Meshra Studios, Surrey, Canada\n\n5.YOU'VE GOT THE BEST IN TOWN (3:13)\nBilly Cox: Bass &amp; Vocal\nJerry Stockard: Drums\nJames Nixon: Guitar &amp; Backing Vocals\nShannon Wilford: Harmonica\nGary Serkin: Guitar\nRecorded at Midas Touch Studios, Nashville, TN\n\n6.LET YOUR WORD BE YOUR BOND (3:46)\nBilly Cox: Bass &amp; Backing Vocals\nEugene Golden: Keyboards &amp; Backing Vocals\nGary Serkin: Guitar\nRecorded at Midas Touch Studios, Nashville, TN\n\n7.STONE FREE [LIVE] (4:11)\nBilly Cox: Bass &amp; Vocals\nBuddy Miles: Drums\nKenny Olson: Guitar]\nRecorded Live At Experience Music Project, Seattle WA\n\n8 POWER OF SOUL [LIVE] (7:08 )\nBilly Cox: Bass\nBuddy Miles: Drums &amp; Backing Vocals\nAndy Aledort: Guitar &amp; Backing Vocals\nSheldon Reynolds: Vocals\nRecorded Live At Experience Music Project, Seattle WA\n\n9.WHO KNOWS [LIVE] (9:32)\nBilly Cox: Bass\nBuddy Miles: Drums &amp; Backing Vocals\nEric Gales: Guitar &amp; Backing Vocals\nSheldon Reynolds: Guitar &amp; Vocals\nKenny Olson: Guitar\nRecorded Live At Experience Music Project, Seattle WA\n\n10.FOXEY LADY [LIVE] (5:32)\nBilly Cox: Bass\nBuddy Miles: Drums\nEric Gales: Lead Guitar &amp; Vocals\nSheldon Reynolds: Rhythm Guitar[/color]\nRecorded Live At San Diego Street Scene, San Diego, CA\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1017b8389c0921b3fb5caa51846c9b7d73aac257","amp;dn":"Billy+Cox+%26+Buddy+Miles++The+Band+Of+Gypsys+Return+%28rock%29%28mp3%4032","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1017b8389c0921b3fb5caa51846c9b7d73aac257","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,23,184,56,156,9,33,179,251,92,170,81,132,108,155,125,115,170,194,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
