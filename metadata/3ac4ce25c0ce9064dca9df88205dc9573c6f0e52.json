(In utter defiance of historical accuracy, the team consists of three Americans and one Brit.) Armed with jeeps equipped with .50-caliber machine guns--and endless chutzpah--they wage a highly irregular war against Rommel's Afrika Korps. Their most common nemesis is Hauptmann Dietrich, though Dietrich and the Rats join forces from time to time against a common enemy. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060018/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060018/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n640x464\nFrame Rate 29/frames per second\nTotal bitrate 1140 kbps\n\nEnjoy season 1.
