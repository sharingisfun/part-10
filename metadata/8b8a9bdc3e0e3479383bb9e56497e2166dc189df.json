She has been noted for her ethereal visual style and symbolic lyrics.[1]\n\nNicks joined Fleetwood Mac on December 31, 1974, along with her then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song &quot;Dreams&quot;, which was the band's first and only U.S. number one) and remained at #1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the ninth highest selling album of all time.\n\nNicks began her solo career in 1981 with the 8 million selling album Bella Donna, and she has produced six more solo studio albums to date. Her seventh solo studio album entitled In Your Dreams, and her first in ten years, has completed production with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics fame at the helm, and was released on May 3, 2011.\n\nAfter the release of her first solo album, Rolling Stone deemed her &quot;The Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll&quot;.[2] Having overcome cocaine addiction, and dependency on tranquilizers, Nicks remains a popular solo performer. As a solo artist, she has garnered eight Grammy Award nominations[3] and, with Fleetwood Mac, has a further five nominations (one of her nominations with Fleetwood Mac won the 1977/1978 award for Album of the Year for Rumours). As a member of Fleetwood Mac, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Your Dreams 2011\n\n\nIn Your Dreams[1] is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks, released on May 3, 2011 by Reprise Records. It is her first studio album since 2001's Trouble in Shangri-La.\n\nIn late February 2010, David A. Stewart (musician and record producer, best known for his work with Eurythmics) revealed, using his Twitter account, that he was working with Nicks on at least four new songs, including one called &quot;Everybody Loves You&quot;.[2][3] A 38-second snippet of the song was posted on Stewart's Twitter account. He confirmed that he and Nicks were working on an album, and said that it is being done &quot;in a very new way&quot;.[4]\n\nOn March 16, 2010, Stewart reported on his Twitter that he and Nicks were now recording songs together.[5] On BBC Radio 2 on May 3, 2010, he stated in an interview with DJ Simon Mayo that the new album will be recorded throughout June with a release later that year, however this proved premature.\n\nOn July 5, 2010, Stewart tweeted several pictures and messages about him and Nicks working in the studio.[6][7] In one of the tweets, Stewart stated that he, Nicks, Waddy Wachtel, Mike Campbell, Michael Bradford, Mike Rowe, and Steve Ferrone were all working on the album, and that Mick Fleetwood has also contributed drums to at least one track. Waddy Wachtel has been Nicks' lead guitarist for most of her solo career, featuring prominently on all of her albums to date. Stewart also stated in that tweet that seven tracks have been completed thus far and it was their final day of these sessions in the studio together.[8] Nicks was scheduled to played five live dates in the US in August, and then returned to the studio to complete writing and recording on the album.\n\nIn a July 2010 interview for the Santa Barbara Independent, Nicks had mentioned a new song on the album, entitled &quot;Italian Summer&quot;, which she wrote in 2009 while on vacation in Italy.[9] Later, in a July 29 interview with the Ventura County Star, Nicks gave an in-depth interview about her career, her new album, and the August &quot;mini tour&quot; she embarked on.[10] She had this to say about the new songs:\n\nThere is an Italian love song I wrote when I was in Italy last summer. There is a crazy, wild rock 'n' roll song called &quot;The Ghosts Are Gone&quot;. There is a song about a novel called &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;, the precursor to Jane Eyre. It was a crazy movie in the '80s that I loved. There are two tracks that Michael Campbell wrote that I wrote songs on top of, and they are just magical. There are love songs, hard rock 'n' roll songs, really contemplative songs and very Bob Dylan-y songs and there are lots of good poems.\n\nThe cover of the album was released on March 7, 2011, via Nicks' website.[11] The cover photograph was taken by Kristin Burns and features Nicks and a horse in a forest scene.[12] The track listing was made available soon after.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Secret Love&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;For What It's Worth&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;In Your Dreams&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;New Orleans&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Annabel Lee&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Soldier's Angel&quot; (with Lindsey Buckingham)\n9.\t&quot;Everybody Loves You&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Ghosts Are Gone&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;You May Be The One&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Italian Summer&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Cheaper Than Free&quot; (with Dave Stewart)\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b8a9bdc3e0e3479383bb9e56497e2166dc189df","amp;dn":"Stevie+Nicks+-+In+Your+Dreams+2011+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b8a9bdc3e0e3479383bb9e56497e2166dc189df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,138,155,220,62,14,52,121,56,59,185,229,100,151,226,22,109,193,137,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
