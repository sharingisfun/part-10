Author J.

The chapters describing the daring escape attempts by Frank Morris and two accomplices from this Ã¢â‚¬Å“inescapableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ prison became the basis for the 1979 Clint Eastwood movie. Discover the intriguing and absorbing saga of Alcatraz, whose name is still synonymous with punitive isolation and deprivation, where AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most violent and notorious prisoners resided in tortuous proximity to one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite cities.The true-crime classic first published in 1963 is reissued in this special edition.Includes archival photos of the prison and prison life.This story will appeal to Bay Area locals and tourists alike.Alcatraz hosts more than a million visitors each year\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJ.
