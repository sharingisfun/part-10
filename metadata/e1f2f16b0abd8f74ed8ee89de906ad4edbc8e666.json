But when the dead girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father seeks to lay the blame on ResnickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partner, DI Lynn Kellogg, Resnick finds the line between the personal and the professional dangerously blurred.\n\nMeanwhile, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency starts to show a keen interest in one of KelloggÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder cases--a case the agency is convinced is linked to international gun running and people trafficking.
