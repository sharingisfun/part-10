Never before have the original rules for these sports coexisted in one volume. Brimming with history and miscellany, it is the ultimate sports book for the thinking fan. Each sportâ€™s chapter includes a short history, the sportâ€™s original rules, and a deeper look into an element of the sport, such as the evolution of the baseball glove; sports with war roots; a compendium of sports balls; and iconic sports trophies. Written by ESPN The Magazineâ€™s former editor in chief, Gary Belsky, and executive editor, Neil Fine, and filled with period-style line drawings in a handsome package, On the Origins of Sports is a book that sports fans and history buffs alike will want to display on their coffee tables, showcase on their bookshelves, and treasure for generations.\r\n\r\nGary Belsky â€“ On The Origins Of Sports 2016 RETAiL eBOOK â€“ DiSTRiBUTiON\r\nApril 19, 2016| English | 256 Pages| PDF | 38.27 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba21bfe180b64fc47d96373c433ea8465ee2e30a","amp;dn":"Gary.Belsky-On.The.Origins.Of.Sports.2016.RETAiL.eBOOK-DiSTRiBUT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba21bfe180b64fc47d96373c433ea8465ee2e30a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,33,191,225,128,182,79,196,125,150,55,60,67,62,168,70,94,226,227,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
