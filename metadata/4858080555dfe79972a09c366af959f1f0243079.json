Those expecting the elegant guitar figures of old were in for quite a surprise. Sweet and crunchy rhythm guitars and goofy synthesizers were the new order of the day, as was a stream of lyrical vitriol. The beguiling eight-minute &quot;The Osmonds&quot; runs down a list of everything an English boy could encounter in the '70s, from velvet flares to the IRA, and ends with a nod to David Essex's &quot;Rock On.&quot; The '70s actually hold up pretty well under Lawrence's critical gaze, particularly considering his passing shots in &quot;Middle of the Road&quot; at the usually revered Stones, Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, and spliffs -- or his outright hostility in &quot;I'm Against the Eighties,&quot; which focuses on &quot;winklepicker kids Mary Chain&quot; and &quot;Duran Duran fake makeup boys.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4858080555dfe79972a09c366af959f1f0243079","amp;dn":"Denim+-+Back+In+Denim+%5B1992%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4858080555dfe79972a09c366af959f1f0243079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,88,8,5,85,223,231,153,114,160,156,54,106,249,89,241,240,36,48,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
