With their replacements, and the addition of extra players, the group had grown to 8 members, producing a varied sound and feel in the music. Thus following the path that always created interest in them. On this disc are three bonus tracks that have never before been released on any of the group s earlier albums. Fans of the group will delight in the fact that they have never heard these songs before. The music on this disc, like all of The Daredevils self-styled, rootsy material has withstood the test of time and offers the same listener appeal as it always did. \n\nTracklist\n1 River to the Sun 3:24 \n2 Crazy Lovin' 3:45 \n3 Giving It All to the Wind 4:15 \n4 The Fox  2:47\n5 Backroads 3:36 \n6 Snowbound 3:31 \n7 Following the Way That I Feel 3:33 \n8 Love Makes The Lover 3:21 \n9 True Believer 4:15 \n10 Moon On The Rise 3:04 \n11 Stinghead  2:10 \n12 Sweetwood  4:30 \n13 Plainity  2:32 \n14 Valencia Road  2:53\n\nTracks  12,13 &amp; 14 Bonus Tracks not on Original Album\n\n\n\nOzark Mountain Daredevils:[/b] [/color]Randle Chowning (vocals, guitar, mandolin); Steve Canaday (vocals, guitar, drums); Michael Granda (vocals, acoustic guitar, bass instrument); Russell Chappell (vocals, keyboards); Steve Cash (harmonica); John Dillon, Larry Lee, Rune Walle, Jerry Mills.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3310bbcc60de2f58ffd6232b986fa12758aad537","amp;dn":"The+Ozark+Mountain+Daredevils++Don%5C%27t+Look+Down+%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3310bbcc60de2f58ffd6232b986fa12758aad537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,16,187,204,96,222,47,88,255,214,35,43,152,111,161,39,88,170,213,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
