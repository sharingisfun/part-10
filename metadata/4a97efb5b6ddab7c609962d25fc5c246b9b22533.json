It is structured on the assumption that an activity-oriented lesson is the most effective instructional strategy for the teaching of study skills: more succinctly, that Ã¢â‚¬Å“learning by doingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the best way study smart.\n\nThe Level I includes a pretest and post-test, a wide variety of teaching suggestions, unit summaries, activities for retrieval and closure as well as teaching adaptations through the use of technology. It was published to help teachers assist students in the development of essential study skills and to reinforce their existing strategies that work. The program supports academic independence for students that have a wide range of ability with college and career readiness as a tangible and realistic goal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a97efb5b6ddab7c609962d25fc5c246b9b22533","amp;dn":"The+hm+Learning+and+Study+Skills+Program%2C+4E-Teacher+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a97efb5b6ddab7c609962d25fc5c246b9b22533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,151,239,181,182,221,171,124,96,153,98,210,95,197,194,70,185,178,37,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
