There are thousands of different species of fungi, so it can be hard to tell which are edible and which are poisonous when you are picking them for yourself in the wild. Safe and unsafe species often closely resemble each other, and worrying about which mushrooms are safe and which might be deadly can take all the fun out of mushrooming. Enter Mushrooming with Confidence! \n\nImproving on the usual overwhelming and exhaustive wild plant guidebook, Mushrooming with Confidence is a slim, handy manual that focuses on the tastiest and most common mushrooms, so that you can easily spot those that are not only safe to eat, but also a delight to cook and share! \n\nHere mushrooms are divided into four identification categories so that anyone will be able to recognize what he or she is looking at quickly and correctly. Thirty of the most common and delicious types are explained in detail, from the common field mushroom to the pretty purple amethyst deceiver and the prolific and tasty charcoal burner. Each mushroom includes a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Positive ID ChecklistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that the reader can go through to be absolutely certain they have the right species, and more than 300 color photographs make it a snap to know exactly what kind of mushroom youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found . . . and whether you really want to pick it! \n\nWith lists of the best tools for mushrooming, the best techniques for getting a mushroom out of the ground in one piece, and even how to remove worms, Mushrooming with Confidence will extinguish any fear or doubt that might stop you from hunting down your own delicious mushrooms. This will prove a fun and essential guide for novice and experienced pickers alike! \n\n300 color photos\n\n\nBy Alexander Schwab\nPublished by Skyhorse Publishing in 2012\nTags: nonfiction, food &amp; drink, nature, guide, mushrooms, fungi, mycology\nEPUB, Retail, 176 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a162e3a6bb5ad9bcf3de5fdbb88e211d6f273364","amp;dn":"Mushrooming+with+Confidence%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a162e3a6bb5ad9bcf3de5fdbb88e211d6f273364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,98,227,166,187,90,217,188,243,222,95,219,184,142,33,29,111,39,51,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
