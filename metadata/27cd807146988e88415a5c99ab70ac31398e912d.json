Along the way, the X-Men must deal with a threat from Mr. Sinister (even initially before he was known to them) and Spider-Man faces Kraven the Hunter, as well as the heroes combining to take on various rogues from their respective galleries. Smart and fun, which many nods to previously established history of all the characters involved, this limited series is well-written by Christos Gage with art by Mario Alberti that lends a classic feel to the proceedings. Thanks to Minutemen-InnerDemons for this digital copy - please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27cd807146988e88415a5c99ab70ac31398e912d","amp;dn":"X-Men+and+Spider-Man+01-04+%282009%2C+Dgtl%2C+Minutemen-InnerDemons%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27cd807146988e88415a5c99ab70ac31398e912d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,205,128,113,70,152,142,136,65,90,92,153,171,112,172,49,57,142,145,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
