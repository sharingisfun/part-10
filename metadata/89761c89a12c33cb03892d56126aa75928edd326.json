ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what the wisdom of history teaches us. \n\nAnd Adolph Hitler was surely the greatest enemy ever faced by modern \ncivilization. Over half a century later, the horror and fascination \nstill linger. \n\nNo one is better able to explain the unexplainable about this man and \nhis movement than professor Thomas Childers. \n\nWith these lectures, you will see what great teaching is all about. \nAs the Student Course Evaluations at the University of Pennsylvania \nput it: &amp;quot;Words do not seem adequate to describe Professor Childers.&amp;quot; \n\nTwo Crucial Questions\n\nProfessor Childers has designed this course to answer two burning questions \nthat have nagged mankind ever since Hitler and Nazism were destroyed.---\n\n1) How could a man like Adolf Hitler and a movement like Nazism come \nto power in, of all places, 20th-century Germany? After all, this was \na highly educated, industrially developed country at the very heart \nof Western Europe. \n\n2) How were the Nazis able to establish the foundations of a totalitarian \nregime in such a short time and hurl all of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â€and the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€into \na devastating war that would consume so many millions of lives?\n\nAnd the answers lead us to other questions:\n\nWho voted for the Nazis and why? How did the Nazis campaign? What did \nthey seem to stand for? \nWhy was there apparently so little resistance? \nWhat made the regime popular at home? \nHow were the Nazis able to seize control of the press, the radio, the \ncourts, and police with so little trouble? \nCan it happen again? \nWhat must we do to make sure that it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t? \nHow did it all begin? \nYou start by exploring the catastrophic impact of World War I on Germany \nand how the war and the humiliating Treaty of Versailles crippled the \nWeimar Republic. \n\nThe Repercussions of the Versailles Treaty in Germany\n\nUntil the very end of World War I, despite enormous casualties in trench \nwarfare and great sacrifices on the home front, Germany had appeared \nto be winning. \n\nThen, in November 1918, the roof suddenly caved in. Inexplicably to \nmany Germans, Germany had lost the war! \n\nThe new democratic government, the Weimar Republic, was forced by the \nvictorious Allies to sign a humiliating treaty and begin its political \nlife carrying a staggering burden. You learn:\n\nhow this widened divisions already present in German society \nhow it created the setting in which extreme nationalist movements could \nthrive.\nThen you examine short-term factors that help explain HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise \nto power:\n\nthe grave economic problems confronting the Weimar government upon which \nHitler and his minions fed: the chaotic hyperinflation of 1923, the \nharsh stabilization of 1924, and the Great Depression \nthe deep cleavagesÃ¢â‚¬â€religious divisions, lingering regional loyalties, \nand growing social or class tensionÃ¢â‚¬â€that made nation-building in the \nnew Germany so difficult \nhow the Nazis used innovative modern campaign techniques to exploit \nthe economic hardship of the day: here is the first use in politics \nof exit polls, radio appeal, and use of aircraft by the candidate \njust which German voters found the Nazis appealing, and why. \nHitler in Power: The Third Reich\n\nThe second half of the course deals with Nazism in power, the Third \nReich. These lectures answer the question of how President Hindenburg \ncame to name Hitler as chancellor in January 1933, at a time when Nazi \nappeal was waning. \n\nAnd they show how Hitler and his henchmen began systematically and ruthlessly \nbreaking resistance, taking over the major institutions of state power \nand creating a totalitarian system of terror, propaganda, and pervasive \nregimentation. \n\nHitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wars: Why and How?\n\nBy 1935, with power now firmly in Nazi hands, the ideological core of \nthe National Socialist movement began to reveal itself. \n\nProfessor Childers anatomizes HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horrifying racial ideas and the \npolicies adopted to transform those ideas into reality. He describes \nthe NazisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mounting repression of the Jewish population and the role \nof the SS in shaping and enforcing these anti-Semitic policies.\n\nHitler as Global Chess Player\n\nNext comes HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conduct of foreign policy between 1933 and 1939. \n\nYou see how he outmaneuvered the apprehensive Western European powers \nand how and why he puzzled the world by entering into an accommodation \nwith his deadly enemy, Stalin, on the eve of World War II. \n\nYou see why the Munich agreement was such an important turning point, \nthe seeming triumph of National Socialism on the world stage.\n\nThe &amp;quot;Final Solution&amp;quot;\n\nIn his closing lectures, Professor Childers focuses on HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war \nagainst the Jews from Mein Kampf to Auschwitz.\n\nHitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war was not simply a traditional geopolitical conflict, a grab \nfor land and resources; it was a racial war as well. It is revealed \nmost obviously in the ideological war against the Soviet Union.\n\nHitler saw his enemy as a &amp;quot;Judeo-Bolshevist&amp;quot; conspiracy, which he was \ncalled on to eliminate. This meant not only a war of annihilation of \nthe Soviet Union; it also meant the destruction of the European Jewish \ncommunity.\n\nProfessor Childers shows how Hitler conducted his war against the Jews \nto the very end and how, finally after so much death and destruction, \nhis evil empire itself was destroyed by Allied might.\n\n&amp;quot;Should I buy Audio or Video?&amp;quot;\n\nThis course works well in any format. The DVD and videotape versions \nfeature dozens of illustrations, including portraits, photographs, maps, \nand on-screen graphics. (Note: Given the nature of the course subject, \nsome photographs include graphic depictions of the Nazi period and the \nHolocaust.)\n\nCourse Lecture Titles \n  The Third Reich, Hitler, and the 20th Century \nThe First World War and Its Legacy \nThe Weimar Republic and the Rise of the Nazi Party \nThe Twenties and the Great Depression \nThe Nazi Breakthrough \nHitler's Assumption of Power \nRacial Policy and the Totalitarian State \nHitler's Foreign Policy \nMunich and the Triumph of National Socialism \nWar in the West, War in the East \nHolocaustÃ¢â‚¬â€Hitler's War Against the Jews \nThe Final Solution\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89761c89a12c33cb03892d56126aa75928edd326","amp;dn":"TTC+%5BThomas+Childers%5D++The+History+Of+Hitler%5C%27s+Empire+%282nd+Ed+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89761c89a12c33cb03892d56126aa75928edd326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,118,28,137,161,44,51,203,3,137,45,86,18,106,167,89,40,237,211,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
