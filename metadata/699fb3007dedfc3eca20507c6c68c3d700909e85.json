One day, after getting into a fight with some hunters, he is located by Yukio, a woman with mutant powers enabling her to see people's deaths, representing Yashida, the CEO of a technology corporation, who is dying of cancer. Logan saved Yashida's life when he was a prisoner of latter while at a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki during its bombing, and Yashida wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan to return the favor.\n\nIn Tokyo, Logan meets Yashida's son Shingen and Shingen's daughter, Mariko. Yashida offers to conduct a transplant, removing Logan's immortality and transferring it to himself. Logan refuses and prepares to leave the following day. That night, while Logan dreams of Jean, Yashida's doctor, the mutant Viper, injects a robotic parasite in Logan's system, which affects his healing factor. The next morning, Logan is informed that Yashida has died, and attends the funeral, where he saves Mariko from Yakuza assassins with help from Yashida's associate Kenuichio Harada, a skilled archer and Mariko's former lover, who still loves her. In the process, Logan is shot and finds out he is not healing as before.\n\nAfter fighting more assassins on a bullet train, Logan and Mariko hide in a local hotel. While Mariko sleeps, Logan stands guard outside and experiences another hallucination of Jean before passing out from his injuries. When he awakens, he discovers that Mariko had the hotel owner's grandson, a veterinarian, stitch him up. Meanwhile, Harada meets with Viper who, after demonstrating her mutant powers on him, demands he find Logan and Mariko.\n\nLogan and Mariko go to Yashida's house in Nagasaki. As they slowly fall for each other, Logan starts revealing his past to Mariko. Meanwhile, Yukio has a vision of Logan dying, and goes to warn him. However, she is too late and Mariko is captured. After interrogating one of her kidnappers, Logan goes to confront Mariko's fiance, corrupt Chief of Justice Noburo Mori, who reveals that Shingen has ordered the kidnapping.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699fb3007dedfc3eca20507c6c68c3d700909e85","amp;dn":"Wolverine+-+Lobezno+Inmortal+%282013%29+AudioLATINO+TSRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699fb3007dedfc3eca20507c6c68c3d700909e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,159,179,0,125,237,252,62,202,32,80,124,108,104,195,215,0,144,158,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
