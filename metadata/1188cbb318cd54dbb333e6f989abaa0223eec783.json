Thanks ***\r\n\r\n*** What are these update packages ?\r\n\r\nUpdate packages for Microsoft Office 2016 contain current updates published since its initial release (October 2015) + 2 batch files.\r\nIt applies to any Microsoft Office 2016 Volume License product (suites, single applications, any edition / language).\r\n\r\n*** Update packages can be used to\r\n\r\n- 1. Update a Microsoft Office 2016 product installed on the target machine = 'offline update'\r\n- 2. Extract MSP update files for later integration in a distribution media / folder\r\n\r\n*** How to's\r\n\r\nXXX 1. Update Microsoft Office 2016 (obviously requires Microsoft Office 2016 VL to be installed on the target machine)\r\n.\r\nUnzip this torrent and run batch file 'Install Updates', preferably as admin.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nFor each update package contained in the directory, the batch file will first determine if it needs to be installed / updated, then install each package in sequence.\r\nThe batch file enables logging so that the log files are generated in the userâ€™s %temp% temporary folder, for example, C:Users\\AppDataLocalTempofficeupdate.log.\r\nLet the batch file do its job, then you can check which updates were actually installed: have a look at the officeupdate.log or go to Windows Update --&gt; Update history --&gt; Installed Updates\r\n\r\nMicrosoft batch file reference: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc178995.aspx#DeployExeWithScript\r\n\r\nXXX 2. Extract MSP update files for later integration in a distribution media / folder (requires an installation package for Microsoft Office 2016 Volume License)\r\n\r\n- If your installation package is in ISO format, extract it to your hard drive in a folder of your choice\r\n- Unzip this torrent and run batch file 'Extract Updates'\r\n- This will create a subfolder 'updates', that will include all *.msp update files\r\n- Go to your Office 2016 installation package, delete all existing files (*.xml's + *.msp's) in the 'updates' folder and copy the newly extracted *.msp update files in your installation package 'updates' folder\r\n\r\nThat's it, your distro of Microsoft Office 2016 VL has been fully updated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1188cbb318cd54dbb333e6f989abaa0223eec783","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+2016+VL+Update+Packages+April+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1188cbb318cd54dbb333e6f989abaa0223eec783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,136,203,179,24,205,84,219,179,51,230,249,137,171,170,2,35,238,199,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
