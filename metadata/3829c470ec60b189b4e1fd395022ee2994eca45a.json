After conducting exclusive interviews with more than one hundred current and former Secret Service agents, bestselling author and award-winning reporter Ronald Kessler reveals their secrets for the first time.\n\n- -\n\nSecret Service agents, acting as human surveillance cameras, observe everything that goes on behind the scenes in the president's inner circle. Ronald Kessler reveals what they have seen, providing startling, previously untold stories about the presidents, from John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as about their families, Cabinet officers, and White House aides. \n\nKessler portrays the dangers that agents face and how they carry out their missions---from how they are trained to how they spot and assess potential threats. With fly-on-the-wall perspective, he captures the drama and tension that characterize agents' lives. \n\nIn this headline-grabbing book, Kessler discloses assassination attempts that have never before been revealed. He shares inside accounts of past assaults that have put the Secret Service to the test, including a heroic gun battle that took down the would-be assassins of Harry S. Truman, the devastating day that John F. Kennedy was killed in Dallas, and the swift actions that saved Ronald Reagan after he was shot. \n\nWhile Secret Service agents are brave and dedicated, Kessler exposes how Secret Service management in recent years has betrayed its mission by cutting corners, risking the assassination of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and their families. Given the lax standards, &quot;It's a miracle we have not had a successful assassination,&quot; a current agent says. \n\nSince an assassination jeopardizes democracy itself, few agencies are as important as the Secret Service---and few subjects are as tantalizing as the inner sanctum of the White House. Only tight-lipped Secret Service agents know the real story, and Kessler is the only journalist to have won their trust.\n\n- - -\n\n  From Wiki:\n\n After leaving the Washington Post, Kessler authored seventeen nonfiction books on politics and current affairs. Three of his books reached the general nonfiction New York Times Best Seller list: Laura Bush (2006), a biography of the first lady; A Matter of Character (2004), an admiring look at George W. Bush's presidency; and Inside the White House (1995), a behind-the-scenes expose of presidencies from Lyndon B. Johnson to Bill Clinton. \n\n A fourth book, The Season (1999), an investigative report of the lives of millionaires in Palm Beach, Florida, made the bestseller list for business books. KesslerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book The FBI: Inside the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency led to the dismissal of William S. Sessions as FBI director over his abuses. \n\n In his book The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI, Kessler presented the first credible evidence that Bob WoodwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and Carl BernsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Watergate source dubbed Deep Throat was FBI official W. Mark Felt. The book said that Woodward paid a secret visit to Felt in California and had his limousine park ten blocks away from FeltÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home so as not to attract attention. \n\n Jon Stewart of The Daily Show said Kessler's The Terrorist Watch: Inside the Desperate Race to Stop the Next Attack is a &quot;very interesting look inside the FBI and CIA, which I think is unprecedented.&quot; The Washington Times said of the book, &quot;Ronald Kessler is a veteran Washington-based investigative journalist on national security...His unparalleled access to top players in America's counterterrorism campaign allowed him a rare glimpse into their tradecraft, making The Terrorist Watch a riveting account.&quot;\n\n Kessler's latest book, In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes With Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect, was described by USA Today as the &quot;inside scoop on those grim-faced guys who protect the president.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3829c470ec60b189b4e1fd395022ee2994eca45a","amp;dn":"IN+THE+PRESIDENT%5C%27S+SECRET+SERVICE+-+Ronald+Kessler.+%7BFerraBit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3829c470ec60b189b4e1fd395022ee2994eca45a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,41,196,112,236,96,177,137,180,225,253,57,80,34,238,41,148,236,164,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
