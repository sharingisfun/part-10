It was actually Byrd who took James Brown into the band and together they made history with a string of hits up to the 1970s. Later he would join Brown again with vocals on several recordings like &quot;Sex Machine&quot;, &quot;Talkin' Loud &amp; Saying Nothin' and &quot;Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved&quot;. He would also go on and record solo hits of his own. Notably his &quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot; scored big around the U.S. \n\n Review by Richie Unterberger\n\nAs is the case with the JB's and other James Brown protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©s, Bobby Byrd's legacy is spread over numerous out-of-print, difficult-to-find vinyl records. So this 22-song retrospective, which gathers numerous singles, and a couple of previously unreleased tracks spanning 1964 to 1973, is a welcome consolidation of his most significant work into one package. Solid stuff, covering both standard soul from the '60s and hard funk (usually featuring the JB's) from the early '70s, though it sounds a lot more like a James Brown record with a different vocalist than a Bobby Byrd record that happens to benefit from James Brown's backing crew. Brown produced (and occasionally contributed to) all of the recordings here, and duets with Bobby on the 1968 single &quot;You've Got to Change Your Mind.&quot;\n\n\n\n \nTracklist:\n\n1 \t\tI Know You Got Soul \t\t\t        3:05 \t\n2 \t\tKeep On Doin' What Your Doin' \t\t\t2:49 \n3 \t\tI Need Help (I Can't Do It Alone), Pts. 1 &amp; 2 \t5:35 \t\n4 \t\tIf You Got a Love You Better (Hold On to It) \t4:24 \t\n5 \t\tI'm Not To Blame \t\t\t        2:51\n6 \t\tHot Pants - I'm Coming, I'm Coming, I'm Coming \t3:27 \t\n7 \t\tSayin' It and Doin' It Are Two Different Things 3:14 \n8 \t\tYou've Got to Change Your Mind (ft.
