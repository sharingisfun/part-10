However, there hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been an easy way for creating animations with web standards until now. This book enables even those with little knowledge of HTML or programming web content to freely create a variety of rich compositions involving motion and interactivity.\n\nLearning Adobe Edge Animate will detail how to use this professional authoring software to create highly engaging content which targets HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Content created in Adobe Edge Animate does not rely on a plugin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so it can be run within any standard browserÃ¢â‚¬â€œ even on mobile.\n\nLearning Adobe Edge Animate begins with providing a complete overview of the shifting web landscape and the Edge Animate application. We then move on through the variety of panels and toolsets available, and explore the many options we have when creating motion and interactivity using Edge Animate.\n\nThe book presents the reasoning behind engaging, standards-based web content and how Edge Animate fills the need for professional tooling in this area. In the book, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll examine content creation, the importing of external assets, how to achieve fluid animation and advanced transitioning through the Edge Animate timeline. The book also covers some cool topics such as interactivity through Actions and Triggers, and it examines workflow options across Adobe Creative Suite applications. Sprinkled throughout the book are tips and references for those coming to Edge Animate from a background in Flash Professional.
