His life begins to change, however, when he finds out he's on academic probation, and when he stumbles into love with Miss Cross, a pretty teacher of the elementary school at Rushmore. Added to the mix is his friendship with Herman Blume, wealthy industrialist and father to boys who attend the school, and who also finds himself attracted to Miss Cross. Max's fate becomes inextricably tied to this odd love triangle, and how he sets about resolving it is the story in the film.\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nStars:           Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams\nimdb:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128445/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128445/&lt;/a&gt;        \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/APLrD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/APLrD.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/VR29I.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/VR29I.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/XYHrA.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/XYHrA.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/CYza1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/CYza1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c331c55d7786ce19635f13175fb0f4b8356d44","amp;dn":"Rushmore+%281998%29+BRRip+720p_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c331c55d7786ce19635f13175fb0f4b8356d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,195,49,197,93,119,134,206,25,99,95,19,23,95,176,244,184,53,109,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
