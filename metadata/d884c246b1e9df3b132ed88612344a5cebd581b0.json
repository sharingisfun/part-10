Making his name with tightly produced and crisply mastered tech trance bombs, the reluctant superstar from Eindhoven quickly shot to the higher echelons of the dance world, conquering every corner of the globe with razor sharp, crowd pleasing DJ sets. His infectious enthusiasm and personality have won him legions of fans who will no doubt be licking their lips, as here is his debut artist album, Supernaturalistic.
