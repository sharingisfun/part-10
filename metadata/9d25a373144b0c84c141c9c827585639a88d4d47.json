(The acronym stands for Computer-Aided Drafting, Computer-Aided Design,\nor both, depending on whom you talk to.) WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equally amazing to the grizzled old-timer writing these words is the fact that many of\ntodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hotshot AutoCAD users werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even born when the program first hit the street! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost as amazing that, 25 years and\ncounting after its birth, AutoCAD remains the king of the microcomputer CAD hill by a tall margin, making it one of the longest-lived PC\nprograms ever. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conceivable that the long-term future of CAD may belong to special-purpose, 3D-based software such as the Autodesk\nInventor and Revit programs, but for the present and the near future anyway, AutoCAD is where the CAD action is.\nAutoCAD has grown more complex over the years, in part to keep up with the increasing complexity of the design and drafting processes that\nAutoCAD is intended to serve. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not enough just to draw nice-looking lines anymore. If you want to play CAD with the big boys and\ngirls, you need to carefully organize the objects you draw, their properties, and the files in which they reside. You need to coordinate\nyour CAD work with other people in your office who will be working on or making use of the same drawings. You need to be savvy about\nshipping drawings around via the Internet. You may even need to be a little cognizant of working with AutoCAD in three dimensions.\nAutoCAD 2012 provides the tools for doing all these things, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not always easy to figure out which hammer to pick up or which nail\nto bang on first. With this book, you have an excellent chance of creating a presentable, usable, printable, and sharable drawing on your\nfirst or second try without putting a T-square through your computer screen in frustration.\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not (And What Is) in This Book\nUnlike many other For Dummies books, this one does sometimes tell you to consult the official software documentation Ã¢â‚¬â€ such as it is.\nAutoCAD is just too big and complicated for a single book to attempt to describe it completely.\nAutoCAD is also too big and complicated for a book like this to cover every feature. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t address advanced topics like database\nconnectivity, customization, or programming, in the interest of bringing you a book of a reasonable size Ã¢â‚¬â€ one that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll read rather\nthan stick on your shelf with those other 1,000 page tomes!\nAutodesk likes to keep its users (and us authors!) guessing about new features in future releases of the software. AutoCAD 2009 surprised\nusers and authors alike with a totally revamped user interface, replacing the drop-down menus and toolbars of previous versions with a\nMicrosoft Office 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œstyle Ribbon (happily, Autodesk doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t force its users to adopt the new look the way Microsoft does Ã¢â‚¬â€ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nstill an Ã¢â‚¬Å“AutoCAD ClassicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ interface available). The new interface got some tweaking in AutoCAD 2010 Ã¢â‚¬â€ 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Menu Browser, which\nessentially duplicated the pull-down menu structure, was replaced with a better-thought-out Application Menu.\nAutoCAD 2010 also delivered two significant new features Ã¢â‚¬â€ parametric drawing and organic (or free-form) 3D modeling. The changes in\nAutoCAD 2012 are relatively minor compared with those: AutoCAD added inferred constraints to its parametric toolbox, and 3D benefitted\nfrom the addition of a major suite of surface-modeling tools. But while the program may not have changed that much from the last release,\nthe book you hold in your hands has changed. For years now, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been bemoaning the fact that lack of space prevented virtually any\ncoverage of 3D modeling. I guess the editors at Wiley got tired of my whining, so AutoCAD 2012 For Dummies proudly presents three new\nchapters on 3D modeling and visualization, written by 3D expert (and AutoCAD 2012 For Dummies technical editor!) Lee Ambrosius.\nThis book focuses on AutoCAD 2012 and addresses its slightly-less-capable but much-lower-priced sibling, AutoCAD LT 2012. I do\noccasionally mention differences with previous releases so that everyone has some context and upgraders can more readily understand the\ndifferences. I also mention the important differences between AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know what you Ã¢â‚¬â€ or your LT-using\ncolleagues Ã¢â‚¬â€ are missing so far as this book is concerned; the major difference is the almost-total absence of 3D capabilities in AutoCAD\nLT. This book does not cover the discipline-specific features in AutoCAD-based products such as AutoCAD Architecture 2012 or AutoCAD\nMechanical 2012 (except for some general discussion in Chapter 1), but most of the information in this book applies to the general-purpose\nAutoCAD features in the AutoCAD 2012Ã¢â‚¬â€œbased versions of those programs as well.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/business-nlp-for-dummies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/business-nlp-for-dummies/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d25a373144b0c84c141c9c827585639a88d4d47","amp;dn":"AutoCAD.2012.For.Dummies%282011%29David.Byrnes.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d25a373144b0c84c141c9c827585639a88d4d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,37,163,115,20,75,12,132,193,65,201,200,39,88,86,57,168,141,77,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
