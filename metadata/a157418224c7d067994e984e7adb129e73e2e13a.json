The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand -- where none had existed before -- for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. ...\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-kingston-trio-p2038/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-kingston-trio-p2038/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nA mammoth four-CD, 107-song box set of their most famous and commercially successful work, recorded for Capitol between the late 1950s and mid-'60s. All of the big hits are here, as well as key album cuts and a whopping 33 previously unreleased studio and live tracks. Collectors will appreciate the inclusion of rarities by related groups like Dave Guard and the Calypsonians (a pre-Kingston Trio outfit), Dave Guard and the Whiskeyhill Singers (Guard's post-Kingston outfit, also featuring Judy Henske), and the Cumberland Three (John Stewart's pre-Kingston group), as well as the awesomely detailed 48-page insert. But this is way too much for anyone but the fanatic. It's interesting to hear the Kingstons' now-obscure versions of songs that would become hits many years later by other artists, like &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; &quot;The First Time (Ever I Saw Your Face),&quot; &quot;Seasons in the Sun,&quot; &quot;It Was a Very Good Year,&quot; and (most incredibly) &quot;Let's Get Together.&quot; But for all its historical significance, the execution is usually far too sterile and whitebread to appeal to contemporary listeners, unless it's on purely nostalgic grounds.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-capitol-years-r231974&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-capitol-years-r231974&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002TOY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002TOY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
