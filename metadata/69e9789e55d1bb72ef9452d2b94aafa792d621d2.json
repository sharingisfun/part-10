Starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore with an ensemble cast featuring Bella Thorne, Emma Fuhrmann, Terry Crews, Joel McHale, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Kevin Nealon, and Shaquille O'Neal, the film was released on May 23, 2014.[3]\n\nBlended marked the third romantic comedy collaboration between Sandler and Barrymore, following The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates. Coraci also previously directed Sandler and Barrymore in The Wedding Singer. It also marked Sandler's first role in a Warner Bros. film.\n\nLauren Reynolds (Drew Barrymore), a divorcee, who has two sons, Brendan (Braxton Beckham) and Tyler (Kyle Red Silverstein), meets Jim Friedman (Adam Sandler), a widower with three daughters, Hilary (Bella Thorne), Espn (Emma Fuhrmann), and Lou (Alyvia Alyn Lind) on a blind date. As Jim's clumsy careless attitude and Lauren's perfectionist nature make each other uncomfortable, the blind date ends up in disaster.\n\nLauren complains about the date to her best friend Jen (Wendi McLendon-Covey). Jim also complains about the way she acted and dressed to his buddy Doug (Shaquille O'Neal).\n\nLauren finds that her elder son, Brendan, has a crush on their babysitter Tracy through a swimwear model's picture, on which he pasted Tracy's face. Lauren tears the picture up but then wants to rectify her actions, so she goes to a pharmacy to search for the particular adult magazine that contains the same poster. Jim finds his eldest daughter, Hilary, needs tampons, so he goes to buy them at the same pharmacy. There, Jim helps Lauren buy the magazine and Lauren helps him buy tampons.\n\nLater, Jim goes to Lauren's house and tells her that the cashier from the pharmacy mixed up their credit cards. Then Jen arrives and begins complaining that she broke up with her boyfriend Dick because he has five kids. Jen explains that she, Dick, and his children are no longer going on a trip to Africa, which had been previously planned by Dick. Jim learns that Jen's boyfriend is his boss, so while Lauren asks Jen to let her go on the trip, Jim calls Dick to ask him to sell the trip to him. Both Jim and Lauren excitedly exclaim that they're going to Africa with their kids.\n\nBoth families meet in Africa, which is actually South Africa as stated by the concierge, and neither Jim nor Lauren is happy to see the other. To make things more awkward, they are put in a romantic suite, while the kids stay in their own room.\n\nThe families are put together for a &quot;blended familymoon&quot;, where they get together with other couples, including the oversexed Eddy (Kevin Nealon) and Ginger (Jessica Lowe), as well as Eddy's teenage son Jake (Zak Henri), who Hilary develops a crush on at first sight.\n\nThe kids make an awkward impression with each other, with Brendan calling his mom &quot;hot,&quot; and the others not knowing how to react to Espn acting like her mom is there with her. Over time, they begin to bond with each other and each other's parents.\n\nJim makes the boys happy by helping them with adventurous sports, while Lauren takes care of the girls, and helps Hilary to change her tomboy look into a more feminine one. Jim and Lauren warm up to each other as time passes. They inadvertently get together for a couples massage and have fun with each other.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, Lauren puts on a beautiful black dress that she admired earlier which Jen bought (actually stole) for her. She wears it that evening and receives admiration from everyone. While the children are pulled away for a kids-only buffet, Jim and Lauren are sat down for a romantic dinner, which Lauren soon discovers was actually planned by Jim specifically for her, and not by Dick for Jen. They chat briefly about basic parenting techniques and then pull in for a kiss; however, at the last second, Jim pulls away, apologizing and explaining that he &quot;can't do it&quot;.\n\nAfter returning home, Jim realizes he misses Lauren and that he's fallen in love with her. Although Espn is not fully ready to move on from her mother's passing, she also doesn't want her dad to lose Lauren. At the kids' behest, Jim goes to Lauren's house to give her flowers, only to find Mark there, pretending to be back with Lauren. Tyler gets excited to see Jim and wants to play ball, but Jim sadly leaves and Mark bails on his son again. Mark later tries to make a move on Lauren, but she refuses since he has continuously failed to be a good father, as well as having an affair with his receptionist during their marriage.\n\nThat following Saturday, Lauren and Brendan go to support Tyler at his game, along with Jen, Dick and his kids. Mark, once again, is a no-show. Jim and his daughters arrive to show encouragement, inspiring Tyler to hit the ball. Jim then finds Lauren and they admit to wanting to be together, and they finally kiss, to the happiness of their kids.\n\n\nVideo:\n\nSource - BluRay Disc\n\nCodec - H264\n\nFile Type - m4v\n\nFile Size - 701 mb\n\nLength - 01:57:12\n\nFrame Width - 640\n\nFrame Height - 420\n\nData Rate - 710 kbps\n\nTotal Bitrate - 829 kbps\n\nFrame Rate - 30 fps\n\nAudio:\n\nCodec - mp3\n\nBit Rate - 118 kbps\n\nChannels - 2(stereo)\n\nAudio Sample Rate - 48 khz\n\nEncoded by - The Immortal HeAdCnA\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e9789e55d1bb72ef9452d2b94aafa792d621d2","amp;dn":"Blended+2014+720p+BRRip+H264+-+HeAdCnA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e9789e55d1bb72ef9452d2b94aafa792d621d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,233,120,158,85,209,187,114,239,148,82,210,185,74,175,167,146,214,33,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
