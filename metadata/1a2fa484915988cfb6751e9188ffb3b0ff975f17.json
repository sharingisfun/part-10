Built in the 18th century, it is still one of the largest privately owned homes in Europe. It was commissioned by one of the wealthiest families in the country whose power and riches put them on a par with royalty. And much of the family's vast fortune was spent on this impressive building and its surrounding estate. But today Wentworth Woodhouse is something of a mystery. Few people know the house, and fewer still have witnessed its palatial grandeur at first hand. By unravelling its hidden history, this film reveals a story of intrigue, family feuding and political wrangling dating back over two hundred years.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1567 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 464\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.793 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-country-house-revealed-a-secret-history-of-the-british-ancestral-home-by-dan-cruickshank-2265621.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-country-house-revealed-a-secret-history-of-the-british-ancestral-home-by-dan-cruickshank-2265621.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2fa484915988cfb6751e9188ffb3b0ff975f17","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Country+House+Revealed+4of6+Wentworth+Woodhouse+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2fa484915988cfb6751e9188ffb3b0ff975f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,47,164,132,145,89,136,207,182,117,30,145,136,255,179,176,255,151,95,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
