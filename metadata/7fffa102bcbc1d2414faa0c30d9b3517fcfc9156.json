Nico Hunter would never be the same. \n\nElle has a good life. A job she loves, a great apartment, and the guy sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been dating for more than two years is a catch and a half. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boringÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and she strives to keep it that way. Too many emotions are dangerous. Her own past is living proof of what can happen when you lose control.\n\nThen Nico walks into ElleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office and everything changesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦for both of them. But what can the tattooed, hard-bodied MMA fighter and the beautiful and always steady attorney have in common? A lot more than they bargained for.\n\n***Author's note*** THIS IS A STAND-ALONE NOVEL.
