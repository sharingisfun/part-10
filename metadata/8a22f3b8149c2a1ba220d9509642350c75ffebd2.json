They put out 4 albums: Gamma 1 in 1979, Gamma 2 in 1980, Gamma 3 in 1982 (all on Elektra Records) and Gamma 4 in 2005. Their best known song is probably &quot;Fight to the Finish&quot; from their first album, but another popular song was &quot;Meanstreak&quot;.\n\nHistory\n\nRonnie Montrose put the band together after having released a solo album (Open Fire) in 1978, after having disbanded the hard rock band Montrose in 1977. Gamma were a far more AOR-oriented band than Montrose, and used a lot of the latest keyboard technology in their sound.\n\nTheir debut album &quot;Gamma 1&quot; was released in 1979 and reached #131 on the Billboard Album charts, totalling 17 weeks on the survey. Gamma scored a hit single with &quot;I&amp;#039;m Alive&quot; which got to #60 on Billboard&amp;#039;s Singles charts. The original lineup of Ronnie Montrose (guitars), Davey Pattison (vocals), Alan Fitzgerald (bass), Jim Alcivar (keyboards) and Skip Gillette (drums) recorded this album.\n\n&quot;Gamma 2&quot; was issued in 1980. Alan Fitzgerald (who later joined Night Ranger as their keyboardist) was replaced by bassist Glenn Letsch, and Denny Carmassi came in on drums. The album had a memorable cover design by Mick Haggerty, featuring 2 sharks with only their fins visible burrowing through a lawn that was being sprinkled. The album peaked at #65, and featured a heavier sound. (e.g. &quot;Mean Streak&quot; and &quot;Cat On A Leash&quot;). There was also a cover version of Thunderclap Newman&amp;#039;s classic &quot;Something in the Air&quot;. It was produced by Gary Lyons and Ronnie Montrose.\n\nJim Alcivar was replaced by Mitchell Froom and &quot;Gamma 3&quot; was released in 1982. The album reached #72 and produced the single &quot;Right The First Time&quot; which reached #77 on the charts and #10 on Billboard&amp;#039;s Album Rock Tracks chart. In Canada, &quot;Right The FIrst Time&quot; peaked at #27, making the song the band&amp;#039;s only top 40 hit on a national pop chart. The album&amp;#039;s opening track, &quot;What&amp;#039;s Gone Is Gone&quot;, and tracks like &quot;No Way Out&quot;, were arena rockers, while others like &quot;Condition Yellow&quot; and &quot;Moving Violation&quot;, continued the odd writing style and sounds that the band started with on their debut album.\n\nHowever, Gamma&amp;#039;s label Elektra Records never really promoted the band, and with only moderate sales, they disbanded.\n\n* Ronnie Montrose resumed solo activities, releasing a series of instrumental albums with little success, before reforming Montrose in 1987 with a new lineup.\n\n* Davey Pattison went on to sing for Robin Trower, and also sang on two songs from Ronnie Montrose&amp;#039;s 1990 solo album, &quot;The Diva Station&quot;.\n\n* Denny Carmassi went on to drum for over a decade with Heart, then played with Coverdale/Page and Whitesnake. In 2002 he joined Foreigner for touring duties.\n\n* Mitchell Froom went on to become a highly successful producer in the 1980s and 1990s, producing albums for Elvis Costello, Los Lobos, Crowded House, Suzanne Vega, Paul McCartney, the Del Fuegos, Bonnie Raitt, and many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nGamma - Gamma 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Gamma\nAlbum................: Gamma 1\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1979\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.97\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, APE v2,000\nInformation..........:\n\nRipped by............: Grayghost on 12/2/2008\nPosted by............: Grayghost on 12/2/2008\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\nCovers...............: Front Back\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
