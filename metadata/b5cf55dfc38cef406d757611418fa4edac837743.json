R. Cash, was an American singer-songwriter, actor,[3] and author,[3] who has been called one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century.[4] Although he is primarily remembered as a country music artist, his songs and sound spanned many other genres including rockabilly and rock and rollÃ¢â‚¬â€especially early in his careerÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as blues, folk, and gospel. Late in his career, Cash covered songs by several rock artists, among them the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails[5][6] and the synthpop band Depeche Mode.[6][7][8]\n\nCash was known for his deep, distinctive bass-baritone voice;[9][10][11] for the &quot;boom-chicka-boom&quot; freight train sound of his Tennessee Three backing band; for his rebelliousness,[12][13] coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor;[9] for providing free concerts inside prison walls;[14][15] and for his dark performance clothing, which earned him the nickname, &quot;The Man in Black&quot;.[16] He traditionally started his concerts by saying, &quot;Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.&quot;[17][18] and usually following it up with his standard &quot;Folsom Prison Blues.&quot;\n\nMuch of Cash's music, especially that of his later career, echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption.[9][19] His signature songs include &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, &quot;Get Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Man in Black&quot;. He also recorded humorous numbers, such as &quot;One Piece at a Time&quot; and &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called &quot;Jackson&quot;; as well as railroad songs including &quot;Hey Porter&quot; and &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;.[20]\n\nCash, a devout but troubled Christian,[21][22] has been characterized &quot;as a lens through which to view American contradictions and challenges.&quot;[23][24][25] A Biblical scholar,[3][26][27] he penned a Christian novel entitled Man In White,[28][29] and he made a spoken word recording of the entire New King James Version of the New Testament.[30][31] Even so, Cash declared that he was &quot;the biggest sinner of them all&quot;, and viewed himself overall as a complicated and contradictory man.[32][33] Accordingly,[34] Cash is said to have &quot;contained multitudes&quot;, and has been deemed &quot;the philosopher-prince of American country music&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Walk The Line  2005\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nHey Porter\nGive My Love to Rose\nGuess Things Happen That Way\nLuther Played the Boogie\nI Could Never Be Ashamed of You\nBlue Train\nI Walk the Line\nThe Ways of a Woman in Love\nDown the Street to 301\nGoodbye Little Darlin'\nThanks a Lot\nFolsom Prison Blues\nRock Island Line\nYou're the Nearest Thing to Heaven\nI Heard That Lonesome Whistle Blow\nGet Rhythm\nThere You Go\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5cf55dfc38cef406d757611418fa4edac837743","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+I+Walk+the+Line+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5cf55dfc38cef406d757611418fa4edac837743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,207,85,223,195,140,239,64,109,117,118,17,65,143,164,237,172,131,119,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
