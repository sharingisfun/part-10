Connectify is an easy-to-use and reliable software router that makes use of your Wi-Fi card to share your Internet connection.\nOn the other hand, Connectify Dispatch will help you quickly and easily combine all your PCs Internet connections for blazing speeds. Dispatch is particularly well-suited for BitTorrent and web pages - any download that naturally involves multiple files.\nWhile monolithic streams like Netflix canGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t be split across connections, Dispatch will assign them to the fastest connection - and route other requests to secondary connections.\n\nNew Features:\nDispatch:\nApplication Settings: The Applications screen (Settings &gt; Applications) has been totally redone, and has become a powerful new tool to both understand and control what your applications are doing with your Internet connections.\nThe window is scalable. If you stretch it wide, it will show you all of the information on each application in separate columns. If the window is narrower, it will show only the most pertinent information.\nEvery application running on your system gets a row in the table. That row turns green whenever it actually accesses the Internet. There are several columns of data: Current Usage, Total Usage and Tracked Connections (open sockets).\nEach application has an Adapter Setting. Selecting this brings up a dialog that lets you select how Dispatch will handle connections from the application:\nSmart Load Balancing:\nDefault Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Uses DispatchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intelligent load balancing algorithm\n\n\nInstructions:\n&gt;Install the latest version of Connectify\n&gt;Finish the entire installation\n&gt;Now launch Connectify Activator\n&gt;Click Activate PRO button\n&gt;Activator will show a message box saying Connectify successfully activated\n&gt;Wait 1 minute and Launch Connectify\n&gt;Ignore and close Activate Connectify Windows [image]\n&gt;ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it you are ready to go with Connectify PRO !\n&gt;Launch Dispatch and make sure its PRO too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceff0c2bee61df7a81dd1f4cb72729d3695fba19","amp;dn":"Connectify+Hotspot+Pro%2BDispatch+Pro+9.0.3.32290","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceff0c2bee61df7a81dd1f4cb72729d3695fba19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,255,12,43,238,97,223,122,129,221,31,76,183,39,41,211,105,95,186,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
