The Dark Angels, too, face a time of testing, both among the stars and on their home world Caliban. Luther, once Lion ElÃ¢â‚¬â„¢JonsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trusted second-in-command, now languishes as an exile in all but name while his master struggles to thwart the traitorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ advance upon the forge world Diamat. But an ancient evil gathers its strength beneath the surface of Caliban, and the First Legion will soon be thrust into a deadly conflict where all that they know will be cast into doubt.\n\n\nremember to support the artist and buy the book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d4a662cbfcac55e2a261c571d09eecb4d349b8","amp;dn":"Mike+Lee+-+Warhammer+40k+-+Fallen+Angels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97d4a662cbfcac55e2a261c571d09eecb4d349b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,212,166,98,203,252,172,85,226,162,97,197,113,208,158,236,180,211,73,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
