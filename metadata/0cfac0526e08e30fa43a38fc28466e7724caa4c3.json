This country house in the Buckinghamshire countryside was home to BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most brilliant mathematical brains, like Alan Turing, and the scene of immense advances in technology Ã¢â‚¬â€œ indeed, the birth of modern computing. The military codes deciphered there were instrumental in turning both the Battle of the Atlantic and the war in North Africa.\n\nBut, though plenty has been written about the boffins, and the codebreaking, fictional and non-fiction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Robert Harris and Ian McEwan to Andrew HodgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ biography of Turing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what of the thousands of men and women who lived and worked there during the war?
