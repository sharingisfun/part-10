Unlike the vast majority of BR's discography, Into the Unknown makes use of slower tempos, nonstandard punk instrumentation like keyboards/synth, and AOR-style lyrics and presentation. I have heard it referred to as Bad Religion's &quot;prog rock record.&quot; According to legend, nearly all copies of the original pressing of 10,000 were returned by pissed-off fans who expected something more in the vein of BR's How Could Hell Be Any Worse (1982). The musical departure also caused a temporary rift in the band, as drummer Pete Finestone and bassist Jay Bentley quit over their creative differences with Graffin and Gurewitz. The album was not reissued until the retrospective Thirty Years of Bad Religion box set, and has generally been disavowed by the band as a disastrous mistake. \n\nTaken out of it's original context, however, the album is actually pretty decent and worth a listen. \n\n1. It's Only Over When... 3:33 \t\n2. Chasing The Wild Goose 2:48 \t\n3. Billy Gnosis \t3:30 \t\n4. Time And Disregard \t6:50 \t\n5. The Dichotomy \t4:48 \t\n6. Million Days \t3:48 \t\n7.
