It increases your throughput and \nreduces your Ping. Whenever you access the Internet with more than one data stream cFosSpeed can optimize the traffic. \nThe program attaches itself as a device driver to the Windows network stack where it can then perform packet inspection \nand layer-7 protocol analysis. Ping optimizer plus packet prioritization. Traffic Shaping is a method for optimizing the \nInternet traffic. It allows maximum speed while ensuring minimal Ping. Outgoing traffic is not sent out indiscriminately. \nInstead, data packets are first queued and then sent out in order of their priority. This way, data that is needed immediately \nis transmitted before less time-critical data. cFosSpeed also reduces network congestion for downloads by lowering the \nTCP window size to keep the sender from sending too much data at once.\n\nConnections:\n- Broadband: Cable and DSL\n- Narrow band: Modem and ISDN\n- Mobile (UMTS, HSDPA, GSM, GPRS, HSCSD)\n- DSL, PPPoE\n- DSL, PPPoA (VCmux and LLC)\n- DSL, PPTP\n- VDSL\n- Cable\n- ISDN\n- IP over AAL\n- RFC1483/2684 bridged\n\nCFosSpeed ??increases throughput and reduces the ping:\nEvery time you connect to the internet and using more than one data stream CFosSpeed ??can optimize traffic.\n- Improves your Ping for online games\n- Supports Internet quickly during heavy loading / unloading\n- NEW: Improved mobile internet\n- Reduce problems with the audio / video Internet streams\n- Improves voice quality in programs using VoIP\n\nOptions:\n- If an ACK is not sent quickly enough, the download may be slow during the injection (in the case of the standard prioritization).\n- With the standard Auto Tuning TCP for Windows download can be slow. Rashireniem RWIN for cFosSpeed ??can increase \nthe speed.\n- CFosSpeed ??can also increase download speeds for specific programs: the test results).\n- CFosSpeed ??supports low latency ping, even with large amounts of downloads and uploads.\n\nPrioritization:\n- Using the prioritization schemes settings, you can always give their full width of the channel program, since cFosSpeed ??\ndetermines which threads should be a priority.\n- For example, traffic for the games, VoIP and Audio / Video data will have higher priority than downloading / uploading.\n- Distribution of files will by default use the entire width of the Internet channel, but slow down when the program will be used \nwith higher priority.\n- The whole scheme of prioritization is fully customizable and can be changed on the fly.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Full download speed when downloading\n- Keep a low response time of your Internet connection even under heavy load channel\n- Fewer network latency in online games\n- Improved sound quality in VoIP\n- Status window with a custom design - you can always see what proihodit\n\nChanges in 9.05 Build 2070:\nAdded IPv6 to spd ports / stat_infos.\nMPEG Dash is now detected if the content-type is either &quot;text&quot; or &quot;application/...&quot;. Thanks again Lo0olz for dumps.\nFixed IPv6 prefix length for adapter's primary IPv6 address.\nFixed half-open session counter after &quot;spd ns&quot;.\n&quot;Open cFosSpeed console&quot; is now available as well in the context menu under Traffic Shaping, since Win8 doesn't offer the \nstart menu any more.\n\nInstall Notes :-\n\n1. Unrar the app\n2. Install cFosSpeed.\n3. Install the auto trial reset or use the manual reset. \nAnd Enjoy...........\n\nNote: \n1. Configure your security application to allow TR.\n\n2. You have to use this setup if you want to uninstall the auto-reset!\n\n``````````````````````````\n\nIGI30's Torrents at facebook\n\nRemember Me...................IGI30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c05e636097d727eb4727a763fc039b20ab5f83","amp;dn":"cFosSpeed+9.04+Build+2051+Final+Including+Trial+Reset+%7BUploaded%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c05e636097d727eb4727a763fc039b20ab5f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,192,94,99,96,151,215,39,235,71,39,167,99,252,3,155,32,171,95,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
