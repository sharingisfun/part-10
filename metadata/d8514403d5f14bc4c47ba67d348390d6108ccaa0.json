That is except in the eyes of 33-year-old Eve Simon. She's spending Christmas Eve in a bar pounding back the cocktails. Outside, scenes of happy families and couples walking by arm in arm only deepen Eve's inner depression. A single, successful professional, Eve wonders what material success has brought her. The bar closes early forcing Eve to meander her way through the crowded cheerful streets back to her apartment. Rounding the final corner, Eve bumps into a homeless man, Brother James. As usual, Brother is ranting and raving, this time he's on about the lost holiday spirit. Brother pauses to look the tipsy Eve in the eye. He whispers to her, &quot;wish upon the Christmas Star.&quot; Eve hands the man some coins and makes her way home. Alone, with no one and nowhere to go, Eve pulls out a photo album she hasn't touched in years. It's filled with pictures of her rural hometown. One photo in particular brings tears to Eve's eyes. It's her at 21 posing with her then-fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, Scott. Eve walked out on Christmas Eve, twelve years ago... the night before their planned Christmas Day wedding. Feeling lonely and upset, Eve seeks solace in the darkness of the winter night. She ventures out on her balcony, where she spies the lone Christmas Star hanging high in the sky. Remembering Brother James, she makes a wish and goes to bed... Will Eve get a second chance?\n\nSuperstar marketing executive Eve Stevens (Elisa Donovan, Clueless, TV's Sabrina, The Teenage Witch) apparently has it all: a stunning penthouse in New York City, dinners at the finest restaurants, and affairs with rich and powerful men. But now, on a melancholy Christmas Eve as she wistfully remembers the fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© she left behind (Sebastian Spence, Family of Cops), Eve meets her guardian angel, who presents her with an incredible Christmas wish. He's taking her back in time and giving her seven days to live her old life and decide if she wants to do anything differently the second time around.\n\nIn the spirit of It's a Wonderful Life and The Family Man, this special story is an emotional, inspiring, warm-hearted film is perfect for the whole family!  \n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nIf life gave you a second chance... What would you wish for?\n\n   \nSCREENSHOTS:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/65242410647170156387.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/65242410647170156387.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56521587445167018074.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56521587445167018074.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/70495077257365884922.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/70495077257365884922.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/87143072265840872969.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/87143072265840872969.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96928333617391407901.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96928333617391407901.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/79289115443172686110.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/79289115443172686110.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players, XBox 360 &amp; PS3 compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
