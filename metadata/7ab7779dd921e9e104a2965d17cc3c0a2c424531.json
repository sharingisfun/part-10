Its sound referenced disco but added a more disaffected attitude that disco lacked. Their second album saw greater songwriting input from Moyet, adding a rather more mature and soulful flavour, particularly on the hit single &quot;Nobody&amp;#039;s Diary.&quot;\n\nReview\nUpstairs at Eric&amp;#039;s (1982) is Yazoo&amp;#039;s first album produced by the band and E.C. Radcliffe with assistance from Daniel Miller. It reached # 2 in UK and # 92 in US. It was later released as an audio CD in October 25, 1990.\nThe album is an influential synth pop release which did much to establish the link between American-style R&amp;B and European electronica, a marriage which defined much of the Top 40 throughout the 1980s. The album, named after the duo&amp;#039;s living space in producer Eric Radcliffe&amp;#039;s home during the recording, contains three classic singles: &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Go,&quot; the dance-club staple &quot;Situation,&quot; and the ballad &quot;Only You.&quot;\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab7779dd921e9e104a2965d17cc3c0a2c424531","amp;dn":"Yazoo+-+Upstairs+at+Eric%5C%27s+-+%281982%29%5BEAC-MP3%40320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab7779dd921e9e104a2965d17cc3c0a2c424531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,183,119,157,217,33,233,225,4,162,150,93,23,204,60,10,44,66,69,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
