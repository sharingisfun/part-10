Using the rich voices already in the Mac OS X system, Narrator allows you to paste your text into the window or import an RTF, .txt or .doc file into Narrator and your letter, story ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ any text ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is brought to life using voice synthesis. You can choose different voices, rates, pitches, inflections and volumes for each character you assign, giving your text a wide range of expressiveness. There are also silent read-along options for stage directions or for you to read out your own parts. And if you need more characters, you can get additional voices and in several languages.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    * Add One or Many Voices - Choose one voice or many voices to read out your added text.\n    * Customize Each Voice - Adjust the speed, pitch, volume and inflection for each voice.\n    * Listen on iTunes - Export to iTunes or an AAC file to listen on your iPhone, iPad or iPod.\n    * Use with a Script or a Novel - Break up larger works into multiple characters and multiple chapters.\n    * Control Your Text - Control how your text looks. Set line height and paragraph spacing and more.\n    * Substitute Words - Fine tune pronunciations or substitute words or phrases using the Dictionary Preference.\n    * Add More Voices - Add more high definition voices through partner companies.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n    * Mac OS 10.5 +\n\n\n\nCepstral Voices for Mac OS X v 5.2\n\nIs superior to the voices that ship with OS X. I like sending text to the speech system while I do things around the house. Highly recommended! in this folder you find 5 additional voices with registration code (see txt.file)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bc46b54912d82355c73c5d715f4858a38ec0ac","amp;dn":"Narrator+2.1+%26+Cepstral+Voices+OS+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bc46b54912d82355c73c5d715f4858a38ec0ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,188,70,181,73,18,216,35,85,199,60,93,113,95,72,88,163,142,192,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
