It is set in an unnamed penal colony. Internal clues and the setting on an Asian island suggest Octave MirbeauÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Torture Garden as an influence.[1] As in some of KafkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other writings, the narrator in this story seems detached from, or perhaps numbed by, events that one would normally expect to be registered with horror.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the Penal ColonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a story about the last use of an elaborate torture and execution device that carves the sentence of the man on his skin in a script before letting him die, all in the course of twelve hours. As the plot unfolds, the reader learns more and more about the machine, including its origin, and original justification.[2]\n\nThere are only four characters, named only according to their role in the story. The Officer is the machineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operator, the Condemned is a man scheduled for execution, the Soldier is responsible for guarding the Condemned, and the Traveler (in the original, he is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œder Forschungsreisender,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe traveler/researcher,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and often simply ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œder ReisendeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is a European dignitary and visitor.\n\nThe story is told from the point of view of the Traveler, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like the readerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is encountering this brutal machine for the first time. Everything about the machine and its purpose is told to him by the Officer, while the Soldier and the Condemned (who is unaware that he has been sentenced to die) placidly watch nearby. The Officer tells of the religious epiphany the executed experience in their last six hours in the machine.\n\nSummary by wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Penal_Colony\n\n\nMore free ebooks at: www.opencast.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0c62d1c46d061c0d7c167735052c550de3f8d6b","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+In+The+Penal+Colony+by+Franz+Kafka+%5Bwww+opencast+de%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0c62d1c46d061c0d7c167735052c550de3f8d6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,198,45,28,70,208,97,192,215,193,103,115,80,82,197,80,222,63,141,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
