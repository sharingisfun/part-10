When Erik begins digging around, the last person he expects to meet is a beautiful woman that he stupidly promises to protect.\n\n\n\nFrom the first second Kaity looks at him, he can't believe that she is looking at him... and not his scars. However, the club is Erik's life and Kaity has been invited in, but her confession forces the club to put her trust to the test... Back Down Devil MC cannot afford to have a rat amongst them.\n\n\n\nWith no other choice, Kaity puts herself in the crosshairs of a major war.\n\n\n\nWill her years of experience give the club enough time to find their answers or will unexpected secrets get them all killed?\n\n- - -\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF\nASIN#: B00MW7YTM4\nPublished: August 19th, 2014\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c6de9d91ceae843b22655cc56c41789b926506","amp;dn":"DARK+FALL+%28A+Back+Down+Devil+MC+Romance+Novel%29+-+London+Casey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c6de9d91ceae843b22655cc56c41789b926506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,198,222,157,145,206,174,132,59,34,101,92,197,108,65,120,155,146,101,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
