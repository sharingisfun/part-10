Commanded by Heinrich Himmler, the Waffen took part in the invasion of Poland, put down the Warsaw uprising, and were integral in carrying out the Russian campaign. Terrifyingly skilled and effective at enforcing the racist Nazi ideology, the Waffen were also responsible for some of the regime's most barbaric war crimes, for which they were prosecuted at the Nuremberg Trials. \n\nPart of THE WAR ZONE series, this documentary recounts the brutal exploits of the Waffen SS through voice-over narration, interviews, archival footage, 3D graphics, and dramatic re-creations.\n\nIf you need a seed, PM me here: http://suprbay.org/member.php?u=74576","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b1ca1482633404afcd0fc216291ef78f41a1092","amp;dn":"Waffen+SS%3A+Hitler%5C%27s+Elite+Fighting+Force+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b1ca1482633404afcd0fc216291ef78f41a1092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,28,161,72,38,51,64,74,252,208,252,33,98,145,239,120,244,26,16,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
