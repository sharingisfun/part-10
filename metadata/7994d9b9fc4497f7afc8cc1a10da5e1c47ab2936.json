A similar eclecticism and scope also surfaced in his solo work, which couched his charmingly gravelly voice in a rustic yet rich swamp pop fusion of country, blues, and gospel. Born Claude Russell Bridges on April 2, 1942, in Lawton, OK, he began studying classical piano at age three, a decade later adopting the trumpet and forming his first band. At 14, Russell lied about his age to land a gig at a Tulsa nightclub, playing behind Ronnie Hawkins &amp; the Hawks before touring in support of Jerry Lee Lewis. Two years later, he settled in Los Angeles, studying guitar under the legendary James Burton and appearing on sessions with Dorsey Burnette and Glen Campbell. As a member of Spector's renowned studio group, Russell played on many of the finest pop singles of the 1960s, also arranging classics like Ike &amp; Tina Turner's monumental &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;; other hits bearing his input include the Byrds' &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys' &quot;This Diamond Ring,&quot; and Herb Alpert's &quot;A Taste of Honey.&quot; ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifwxqr5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifwxqr5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nAfter a popular period in the first half of the 1970s, Leon Russell dissipated his commercial appeal making duet albums with his wife and country collections. He didn't release a regular studio album between 1979's Life &amp; Love and 1992's Bruce Hornsby-helmed Anything Can Happen. That album was criticized for Hornsby's meddling and performed disappointingly. Seven years later (with another of his &quot;Hank Wilson&quot; country albums in between), Russell is back on a small label with a more characteristic set that he co-produced with his son Teddy Jack. The craggy voice, even craggier now that Russell is in his late fifties, is in place, and the songs are piano-based R&amp;B in his familiar style. Some echoes are even explicit: &quot;Betty Ann,&quot; for example, is a calmer re-write of &quot;Delta Lady.&quot; More often, however, the songs simply are consistent with the swampy style Russell pioneered in the early '70s, especially &quot;Message From My Baby,&quot; &quot;Mean And Evil,&quot; and &quot;Don't Bring The Blues To Bed.&quot; No doubt it is far too late for Russell to regain his commercial standing, but old fans will find this album a long-awaited return to form.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
