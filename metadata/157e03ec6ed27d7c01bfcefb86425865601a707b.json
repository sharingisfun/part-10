Only a few numbers from the stage score were used for the film; Kander and Ebb wrote new ones to replace those that were discarded. In the traditional manner of musical theater, every significant character in the stage version of Cabaret sings to express emotion and advance the plot. In the film version, the musical numbers are entirely diegetic, taking place in the club, and just two of the film's major characters (The Emcee and Sally) sing songs.\nCabaret still holds the record for most Academy Award wins in a single year without winning the highest honor, Best Picture, with eight awards. The film won the Academy Award for Best Director for Bob Fosse, Best Actress for Liza Minnelli, Best Supporting Actor for Joel Grey, and five more technical awards. It lost the Best Picture award to The Godfather, which won three awards.\n\n\n\nNa Alemanha, durante a ascensÃƒÂ£o do nazismo, uma cantora e danÃƒÂ§arina estadunidense se envolve ao mesmo tempo com um professor inglÃƒÂªs e um nobre alemÃƒÂ£o.
