The series is based on Random House's Beginner Book franchise, The Cat in the Hat's Learning Library, and was developed by Portfolio Entertainment, Random House Children Entertainment and Collingwood O'Hare Productions.\n\nEach episode features The Cat in the Hat (voiced by Martin Short), who leads six-year-old neighbors Nick and Sally, the Fish, and Thing One and Thing Two on a variety of adventures in his &quot;Thinga-ma-jigger&quot;, a Seussian contraption that can sprout wings, pontoons, booster rockets, change size, and do just about anything else necessary to further the adventure. The adventures are prompted by a question posed by either Nick or Sally at the beginning of each episode, which will inevitably lead them around the globe to &quot;make natural science discoveries.&quot; Similar to other PBS Kids series such as Curious George and Sid the Science Kid, The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That! focuses on introducing preschoolers to various science and learning concepts, often involving animals and their environments.\n\nThese episodes were encoded by me, using recordings from my local PBS station. These four episodes aired in March 2014, in a week of &quot;Cat-ebration&quot; (celebration of Dr. Suess' birthday.)\n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show. I record any new episodes from my local PBS station on digital cable as they are shown, and will continue to post new packs as long as people continue to seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c635cd01403a14d17fa13d634a90378d3f7be833","amp;dn":"The+Cat+in+the+Hat+Knows+a+Lot+About+That%21+Season+2%2C+Eps+15-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c635cd01403a14d17fa13d634a90378d3f7be833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,53,205,1,64,58,20,209,127,161,61,99,74,144,55,141,63,123,232,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
