In the opening stages Arthur C. Clarke explained how there were four stages in the way scientists react to the development of anything of a revolutionary nature. &quot;Free energy&quot; was now working its way through these four stages of reaction, which were:\n\na: &quot;It's nonsense,&quot;\nb: &quot;It is not important,&quot;\nc: &quot;I always said it was a good idea,&quot; and\nd: &quot;I thought of it first.&quot;\n\nThe scene moved to Rome, Georgia where Jim Griggs of Hydrodynamics, Inc. demonstrated the assembly and operation of a &quot;hydrosonic water pump&quot; which operated over-unity by producing hot water or steam with energy in excess of the electrical energy input to the pump motor. &quot;Over-unity&quot; was confirmed by satisfied customers, including the Albany Fire Station, where engineers from the &quot;local university&quot; and the &quot;local power company&quot; had been called in to verify the over-100% efficiency.\n\nFilesize.....: 209 MB (or 214,885 KB or 220,043,008 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:50:19 (75,464 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 511 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 64 kb/s (32/ch, stereo) VBR \nFrame Size...: 320x232 (1.38:1) [=40:29]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74de811991ec906e31c43fc5c19b104940d3190c","amp;dn":"Equinox+-+It+Runs+on+Water+-+Overunity+%28Free+Energy+Broadcast+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74de811991ec906e31c43fc5c19b104940d3190c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,222,129,25,145,236,144,110,49,196,63,197,193,155,16,73,64,211,25,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
