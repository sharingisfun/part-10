They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be brushed, walked, or entertained. Happy chickens just need you to gather their eggs once a day, feed and water them a couple times a week, and change their roost bedding once a month. You can feed them kitchen scraps, eat their eggs, and use their bedding for compost. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a more environmentally friendly pet. If you already know all this, then you know that learning how to do this can be of great benefit to you and your family.\n\nIn this book you will learn all the ins and outs raising chickens in your backyard, including information about different breeds, how to build a chicken coop and chicken run, what a chicken tractor is, and more helpful details about how you can get started in this endeavor.\n\nAs with all Simple Self-Sufficiency titles, this book is written in an interesting and readable manner, without all the &quot;fluff&quot;.
