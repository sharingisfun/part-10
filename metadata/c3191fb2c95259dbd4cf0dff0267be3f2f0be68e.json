By using this method I have never repaid the debt and never made another payment. This method is based on applicable banking laws, collection procedures and consumer credit rules. It is perfectly legal to dispute the validity of credit card debt.\n\nTwo years ago I was over my head in credit card debt - over $17,000. I felt disgusted with myself and depressed over the mess I had created. I was having trouble making the monthly minimum payments and was falling behind. At times, it felt like my whole world was falling apart. The harassing telephone calls from credit card companies demanding payments weren&amp;#039;t helping either.\n\nLooking for solutions to this financial problem that permeated every aspect of my life, I did some research into debt consolidation, re-negotiation, reduction, and even bankruptcy. These options seemed to offer different chains of slavery to my debt. In a way I felt trapped. I knew that I didn&amp;#039;t want to become a slave to the debt for the rest of my life. I secretly wished that the burden of debt could somehow magically disappear, that I could just snap my fingers and poof it would be gone.\n\nAnd then one day, I found exactly what I was looking for - Credit Card Debt Termination. At first, it was hard to believe and sounded too good to be true. But it felt like I had run out of options, so I decided to investigate. I approached it with an open mind and the more I read the more excited I became.\n\nPerhaps you may believe as I did, that banks loan you their own money when you sign up for a credit card.\n\nThis is complete false.\n\nAt no time does the bank loan you any of their own money or any of their depositors&amp;#039; money. In fact, they are prohibited to do so under the Federal Reserve Banking regulations.\n\nWhen you sign up for a credit card and the bank approves your application, they use your name and your signature on the application to create the money to fund the card. The bank didn&amp;#039;t have the money until you signed the application.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3191fb2c95259dbd4cf0dff0267be3f2f0be68e","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+Credit+Card+Debt+Termination+-+Legally+Eliminate+Debt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3191fb2c95259dbd4cf0dff0267be3f2f0be68e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,25,31,178,201,82,89,219,212,207,13,255,2,103,190,63,47,11,230,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
