Although research findings are presented, they are described with emphasis on what is relevant for assessment, treatment and management of pediatric conditions. The authors have chosen to focus on a number of areas. First, the text examines the natural history of childhood CNS insult, highlighting studies where children have been followed over time to determine the impact of injury on ongoing development. Second, processes of normal and abnormal cerebral and cognitive development are outlined and the concepts of brain plasticity and the impact of early CNS insult discussed. Finally, using a number of common childhood CNS disorders as examples, the authors develop a model which describes the complex interaction among biological, psychosocial and cognitive factors in the brain injured child.\nThe text will be of use on advanced undergraduate courses in developmental neuropsychology, postgraduate clinical training programmes, and for professionals working with children in clinical psychology, clinical neuropsychology, and in educational and rehabilitation contexts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f4f00946a21f17461bf3518d97e508671370447","amp;dn":"Developmental+Neuropsychology+-+Anderson+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f4f00946a21f17461bf3518d97e508671370447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,79,0,148,106,33,241,116,97,191,53,24,217,126,80,134,113,55,4,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
