I believe that learning to better communicate is vital and revolutionary. Please note that Marshall has a kind of Mr. Rogers way of speaking but what he's talking about is crucial.\n\n&quot;All that has been integrated into NVC has been known for centuries about consciousness, language, communication skills, and use of power that enable us to maintain a perspective of empathy for ourselves and others, even under trying conditions.&quot;\n-- Marshall B. Rosenberg, Phd\n\nNonviolent Communication contains nothing new. It is based on historical principles of nonviolence-- the natural state of compassion when no violence is present in the heart. NVC reminds us what we already instinctively know about how good it feels to authentically connect to another human being.\n\nWith NVC we learn to hear our own deeper needs and those of others. Through its emphasis on deep listeningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to ourselves as well as othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½NVC helps us discover the depth of our own compassion. This language reveals the awareness that all human beings are only trying to honor universal values and needs, every minute, every day.\n\nNVC can be seen as both a spiritual practice that helps us see our common humanity, using our power in a way that honors everyone's needs, and a concrete set of skills which help us create life-serving families and communities.\n\nThe form is simple, yet powerfully transformative.\n\n4 Steps of NVC\n\nThrough the practice of NVC, we can learn to clarify what we are observing, what emotions we are feeling, what values we want to live by, and what we want to ask of ourselves and others. We will no longer need to use the language of blame, judgment or domination. We can experience the deep pleasure of contributing to each others' well being.\n\nNVC creates a path for healing and reconciliation in its many applications, ranging from intimate relationships, work settings, health care, social services, police, prison staff and inmates, to governments, schools and social change organizations.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.cnvc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.cnvc.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f2316dd9c43559016e3a51ecb31034adb37980","amp;dn":"Non+Violent+Communication+Training+by+Marshall+Rosenberg+%5Bm4a+fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f2316dd9c43559016e3a51ecb31034adb37980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,242,49,109,217,196,53,89,1,110,58,81,236,179,16,52,173,179,121,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
