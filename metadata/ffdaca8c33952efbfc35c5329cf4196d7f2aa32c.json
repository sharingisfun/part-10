This essay is illustrated with not only reproductions of Monet's paintings but photographs of Monet's garden from that period; (4) &quot;Monet as a Garden Artist&quot; by Elizabeth Murray focuses on the strong parallels between Monet as a painter and a gardener. The essay includes a detailed diagram of both the Flower Garden and the Water Garden at Monet's home in Giverny, as well as an axial view of the two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffdaca8c33952efbfc35c5329cf4196d7f2aa32c","amp;dn":"Monet+-+Late+Paintings+of+Giverny+From+the+Musee+Marmottan+%28Art%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffdaca8c33952efbfc35c5329cf4196d7f2aa32c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,218,202,140,51,149,46,251,252,53,197,50,156,244,25,109,127,42,163,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
