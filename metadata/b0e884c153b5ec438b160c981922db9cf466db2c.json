She was suddenly absorbed into Habsburg court life, which she found stifling. She was also at odds with her interfering mother-in-law, Princess Sophie, who took over the rearing of Elisabeth's daughters, one of whom died in infancy. The birth of a male heir Rudolf improved her standing at court, but her health was suffering under the strain, and she would often visit Hungary for its more relaxed environment. She came to develop a deep kinship with Hungary, and helped to bring about the dual monarchy of AustriaÃ¢â‚¬â€œHungary in 1867.\n\nThe death of her only son Rudolf, and his mistress Mary Vetsera, in a murderÃ¢â‚¬â€œsuicide tragedy at his hunting lodge at Mayerling was a shock from which Elisabeth never recovered. She withdrew from court duties, and travelled widely, unaccompanied by her family. In the palace, she was seen to be obsessively concerned with her health and beauty, having to be sewn into her leather corsets and spending two or three hours a day on her coiffure. While travelling in Geneva in 1898, she was stabbed to death by Luigi Lucheni, an Italian anarchist, who had missed his chance to assassinate Prince Philippe, Duke of OrlÃƒÂ©ans and wanted to kill the next member of royalty that he saw. Elisabeth was the longest-reigning Empress of Austria, at 44 years.
