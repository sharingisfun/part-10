INTRODUCTION\n\nThank you for downloading this torrent. It contains:\n - All the Michel Thomas Method recordings now available for English speakers \n   (in Arabic, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese,    \n   Portuguese, Russian and Spanish) \n - Two of the seven courses now available for French speakers\n - Transcripts of the recordings published before 2007\n - Scans of the booklets which accompany most of the courses\n - Some miscellaneous material\n\nIt does not yet contain:\n - the remaining courses published for native French speakers (teaching \n   English, Spanish and Chinese - see www.harraps-audio.harrap.com), \n - the materials produced for schools (see www.michelthomasforschools.co.uk), \n - the biography of Michel Thomas (&quot;Michel Thomas: The Test of Courage&quot; \n   by Christopher Robbins), and the book &quot;Michel Thomas: The Learning   \n   Revolution&quot; by Jonathan Solity\n - the remaining booklets which accompany the courses\n\nIf you have any of these, please upload them.\n\nPlease encourage Hodder to continue producing new courses by BUYING \nthe recordings you think live up to the promises Hodder make for them.\n\n - The full courses can be purchased at a good discount from Amazon \n   (www.amazon.com) and from many other online retailers\n\n - The courses can be bought in a downloadable (but reduced quality) format \n   from www.audible.co.uk/michelthomas\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. HOW TO USE MICHEL THOMAS\n\nNot used Michel Thomas before? \n\nIt&amp;#039;s better to do one language at a time (not all ten simultaneously). One CD a \nday would be realistic, but you can stop studying at any point during a\nrecording and pick it up where you left it the next day.\n\nStudy Foundation first, then Advanced, then Vocabulary (if it&amp;#039;s available), \nthen Builder (if it&amp;#039;s available and if you feel like it).\n\nFor full instructions, read one of the course guides in the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;\nfolder. (The instructions are more or less the same for all courses.)\n\nHappy learning!\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. NEW MATERIALS IN VERSION 2 OF THE TORRENT\n\n - The brand new Foundation courses in Dutch, Japanese and Portuguese\n - Foundation and Advanced courses in English for French speakers (thanks for \n   the upload!)\n - Scans of most of the booklets that accompany the courses (thanks for the \n   upload!)\n - Some new miscellaneous material\n\n - All files have been compressedv by disc, not by course. You can now use a\n   suitable Bit Torrent client to download a single CD, if you need it\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.
