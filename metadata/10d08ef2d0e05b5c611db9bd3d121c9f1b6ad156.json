The album was recorded in 1987 and 1988, and released in 1988. It is the final solo album recorded by Mercury, who died of AIDS on November 24, 1991.\n\nAfter Barcelona was selected to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, Mercury was approached to write a song as a theme for the forthcoming games. The idea was to create a duet with Montserrat, as she is from the city. Mercury had been a long standing admirer of Montserrat and she in turn grew to respect his talents very highly. They decided to work on an album together, with Mercury and Mike Moran taking the creative lead as songwriters. Mercury and Moran made and sent her tapes of the music with Freddie singing in falsetto as a lead vocal for Montserrat's parts. As they rarely had an opening in their schedule to meet, her parts were recorded at another location\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Barcelona&quot;   \t5:37\n2. \t&quot;La Japonaise&quot; (&quot;The Japanese&quot;) \t4:49\n3. \t&quot;The Fallen Priest&quot;   \t5:46\n4. \t&quot;EnsueÃƒÂ±o&quot;   \t4:27\n5. \t&quot;The Golden Boy&quot;   \t6:04\n6. \t&quot;Guide Me Home&quot;   \t2:49\n7. \t&quot;How Can I Go On&quot;   \t3:51\n8. \t&quot;Overture Piccante&quot;   \t6:40","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d08ef2d0e05b5c611db9bd3d121c9f1b6ad156","amp;dn":"Freddie+Mercury+-+Barcelona+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d08ef2d0e05b5c611db9bd3d121c9f1b6ad156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,208,142,242,208,224,91,92,97,29,185,189,61,18,28,159,27,106,209,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
