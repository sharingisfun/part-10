Beginning his practice in earnest after it helped him solve a creative problem during the production of his breakout 1977 film Eraserhead, he has continued meditating assiduously ever since, going so far as to found the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and Peace and publish a pro-meditation book called Catching the Big Fish. It might seem nonsensical to hear an artist of the grotesque like Lynch speak rapturously about voyaging into his own consciousness, let alone in his fractured all-American, askew-Jimmy-Stewart manner, but he does meditate for a practical reason: it gives him ideas. Only by meditating, he says, can he dive down and catch the Ã¢â‚¬Å“big fishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he uses as ingredients in his inimitable film, music, and visual art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a22d37dc53cd314de41f67e840999993c5db09a","amp;dn":"David+Lynch+-+Consciousness%2C+Creativity+and+the+Brain+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a22d37dc53cd314de41f67e840999993c5db09a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,34,211,125,197,60,211,20,222,65,246,126,132,9,153,153,60,93,176,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
