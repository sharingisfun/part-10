Remastered)\nTotal time: 39:52\nQuality: 320 kbps\n\nGuitarist Barney Kessel teams up with Bob Cooper (mostly on oboe but also doubling a bit on tenor), either Claude Williamson or Hampton Hawes on piano, Monty Budwig or Red Mitchell on bass, and Shelly Manne or Chuck Thompson on drums.  Other than his own &quot;64 Bars on Wilshire&quot; and &quot;Barney's Blues,&quot; the repertoire on this CD reissue is comprised of jazz standards.  Inventive frameworks and the utilization of Cooper's jazz oboe (a real rarity in jazz of the time) give the otherwise boppish reissue its own personality. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nBarney Kessel (Guitar) \nBob Cooper (Tenor Saxophone and Oboe) \nHampton Hawes (Piano) - 5,6,10,11 \nClaude Williamson (Piano) - 1-4,7-9,12 \nMonty Budwig (Double Bass) - 1-4,7-9,12 \nShelly Manne (Drums) - 1-5,7-12 \nRed Mitchell (Double Bass) - 5,6,10,11 \nChuck Thompson (Drums) - 6 \n\nBarney Kessel - Kessel Plays Standards Tracks:\n01  Speak Low (Kurt Weil/Ogden Nash) 2:45 \n02  Love is Here to Stay (George Gershwin/Ira Gerswin) 3:26 \n03  On a Slow Boat to China (Frank Loester) 3:18 \n04  How Long Has This Been Going On?
