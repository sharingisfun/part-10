In &quot;The Antichrist,&quot; Nietzsche presents a highly controversial view of Christianity as a damaging influence upon western civilization that must come to an end. Regardless of ones religious or philosophical point of view, &quot;The Antichrist&quot; makes for an engaging philosophical discourse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a672634783ed3236be4536f6f34d368d6713f68c","amp;dn":"The+Antichrist+by+Friedrich+Wilhelm+Nietzsche+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a672634783ed3236be4536f6f34d368d6713f68c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,114,99,71,131,237,50,54,190,69,54,246,243,77,54,141,103,19,246,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
