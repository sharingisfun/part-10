Robert is in good voice (something \r\nthat doesn't happen often in 1975), and the band is amazing. Start to \r\nfinish this show is great ... even the long Moby Dick is enjoyable. \r\n(Bonham was introduced as &quot;the man with a bicycle clip caught in his \r\nsock ... the greatest percussionist since Big Ben!&quot;) No Quarter is a \r\nwonderful jam with some excellent piano from Jonesy and Kashmir is epic. \r\nDazed And Confused is long and great, and the drumming, in particular, \r\nis immense. This is also the date on which Physical Graffiti was finally \r\nbeen released in the United States and Plant commented that fact: &quot;The \r\negg has been laid ... or is it the guy who got laid?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c386a3083dc88c9420cf7aa3bc0e40ec6d60445","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.02.28+Baton+Rouge%2C+Louisiana+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c386a3083dc88c9420cf7aa3bc0e40ec6d60445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,56,106,48,131,220,136,201,66,12,247,170,59,192,228,14,198,214,4,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
