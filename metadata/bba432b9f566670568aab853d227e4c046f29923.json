Flay, MASHed Potatoes, 2009\n\nFLAC download; standard 44100khz stereo, but the bitrates are above the 1411 of CD quality. 24bit I assume\n\nI like her use of samples. The lyrics are all hers [except for three well-placed featured verses], and they're all beautiful.\nMany of the songs are quite upbeat (but not in the typical 'party' sense), and I also dig the other ones: Lockdown is a brilliant take on the criminal-&quot;justice&quot; system, Moneymakerz is an interesting iteration of its resentment, Heavy Cross-Out conveys its uphill battle well, and Crazytown's message is very interesting.\n\nHave lots of other K.Flay material available in other torrents.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bba432b9f566670568aab853d227e4c046f29923","amp;dn":"K.Flay+-+MASHed+Potatoes+%5BHQ+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bba432b9f566670568aab853d227e4c046f29923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,164,50,185,245,102,103,5,104,170,184,83,210,39,228,192,70,242,153,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
