The better the stereo, the more effective it is. Give it a try.\n\nInstructions for use: This file should loop seamlessly if you're using an mp3 player on looped playback. haven't experimented with cd playback, .mp3 (CDR) capable audio systems might be an option. I use a PSP for now. Good luck. Spread the word, and please comment.\n\nTry the new version and see if you like it better:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4809503","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4689745baed08fc4244254931f56c17644197d95","amp;dn":"60+minutes+of+white+noise+%28old+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4689745baed08fc4244254931f56c17644197d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,137,116,91,174,208,143,196,36,66,84,147,31,86,193,118,68,25,125,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
