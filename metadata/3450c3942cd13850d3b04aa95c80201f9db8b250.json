According to prominent American critic Harold Bloom, &quot;Pynchon always has been wildly inventive, and gorgeously funny when he surpasses himself: the marvels of this book are extravagant and unexpected.&quot; Harold Bloom has also called the novel &quot;Pynchon's masterpiece to date.&quot;[citation needed] English author John Fowles, writing in The Spectator said of the book &quot;As a fellow-novelist I could only envy it and the culture that permits the creation and success of such intricate masterpieces.&quot; T. Coraghessan Boyle of The New York Times Book Review wrote, &quot;This is old Pynchon, the true Pynchon, the best Pynchon of all, Mason &amp; Dixon is a groundbreaking book, a book of heart and fire and genius, and there is nothing quite like it in our literature,&quot; New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani said, &quot;A novel that is as moving as it is cerebral, as poignant as it is daring... a book that testifies to Pynchon's remarkable powers of invention and his sheer power as a storyteller.&quot;\n In a conversation with Leonard Price of the Onion A.V. Club, Harold Bloom said, &quot;I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what I would choose if I had to select a single work of sublime fiction from the last century....it would probably be Mason &amp; Dixon, if it were a full-scale book, or if it were a short novel it would probably be The Crying Of Lot 49. Pynchon has the same relation to fiction, I think, that my friend John Ashbery has to poetry: he is beyond compare.&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3450c3942cd13850d3b04aa95c80201f9db8b250","amp;dn":"Thomas+Pynchon+-+Mason+%26amp%3B+Dixon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3450c3942cd13850d3b04aa95c80201f9db8b250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,80,195,148,44,209,56,80,211,176,74,169,92,128,32,31,157,184,178,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
