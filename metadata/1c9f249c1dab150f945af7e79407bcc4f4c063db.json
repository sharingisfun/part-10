I think Chad Lowe (brother of Robert) makes a good effort in portraying John Denver, but many of the hard-boiled fans have vented their rage on Imdb, as usual.\n\nGood stereo sound, fullscreen (made for TV). Burn tested, runs well in my divX player\n\nXviD 608x432 two-pass, AC3 \nSource: NTSC-IVTC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9f249c1dab150f945af7e79407bcc4f4c063db","amp;dn":"Take+Me+Home%3A+The+John+Denver+Story+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9f249c1dab150f945af7e79407bcc4f4c063db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,159,36,156,29,171,21,15,148,90,247,231,148,7,188,196,244,192,99,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
