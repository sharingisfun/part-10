Author Neil Slade presents his revolutionary lessons with methods and exercises proven under scientific investigation and daily 'real-life' applications. \n\nThis book outlines the basic principals of how the human brain works, guides readers how to sharpen their everyday 'regular' mind, and most importantly how to access higher modes of advanced frontal lobes circuits. This can additionally turn on such 'hidden' functions as pre-cognition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, telepathy, telekinesis and can allow the ability to communicate with non-ordinary physical and non-physical intelligences and entities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae984039134437fdd64ee48cefc40fba1d093b2","amp;dn":"The+Frontal+Lobes+Supercharge+-+Neil+Slade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae984039134437fdd64ee48cefc40fba1d093b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,233,132,3,145,52,67,127,221,100,238,72,206,252,64,251,161,208,147,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
