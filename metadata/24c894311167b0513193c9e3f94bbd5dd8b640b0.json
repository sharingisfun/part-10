News he posted on YouTube in 2006.\n\nTaking a look at the best, and worst, of today\\\\\\&amp;#039;s TV, The Peter Serafinowicz Show hosts television\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most futile game shows, including Heads Or Tails? and Which Hand Is It In?, and offers \\\\\\&quot;celebrity\\\\\\&quot; interviews on O! News that can\\\\\\&amp;#039;t be seen anywhere else.\n\nThrough his impressions of familiar faces, Peter creates a world in which the likes of Al Pacino and Simon Cowell mingle with his own quirky creations, such as the impressively incompetent private investigator Brian Butterfield.\n\n\nOther characters include Michael-6 ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ the robot chat show host who struggles to understand and solve the problems his guests bring onto the show - and O News! anchor Kennedy St King.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thepeterserafinowiczshow/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thepeterserafinowiczshow/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24c894311167b0513193c9e3f94bbd5dd8b640b0","amp;dn":"The+Peter+Serafinowicz+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24c894311167b0513193c9e3f94bbd5dd8b640b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,200,148,49,17,103,176,81,49,147,201,227,249,75,189,93,216,182,64,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
