I also cannot post links here on TPB in the description as there is an auto censor. So download the 681 KB file and the info is in that small torrent to acquire the 2 Fleetwood Mac torrents. What is downloaded in that 681 kB torrent is some information about the torrent, links to other sites and the 2 .torrent files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Type: FLAC Compression 6\nCd recorder: Plextor PX-716SA\nCd Ripper: Exact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4\nEAC Log: Yes (for most rips)\nEAC Cue Sheet: Yes (for most rips)\nTracker(s):http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce;\nTorrent Hash: 4379F77C9A637C7F6466705921C3BD63BA8E5574\nFile Size: 10.13 Gb\nYears: 1967 - present\nLabels: Blue Horizon, Reprise, Warner Bros, Sire, CBS Europe, Epic, Sanctuary\n\n\n\n\n\nALBUMS AND YEARS IN THIS TORRENT:\n\n\n\nStudio Albums \n\n\nFleetwood Mac 1968 (Peter GreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fleetwood Mac)\nMr. Wonderful 1968\nThen Play On 1969\nKiln House 1970\nFuture Games 1971\nBare Trees 1972\nPenguin 1973\nMystery to Me 1973\nHeroes Are Hard to Find 1974\nFleetwood Mac 1975\nRumours 1977\nTusk 1979\nMirage 1982\nTango in the Night 1987\nBehind the Mask 1990\nTime 1995\nSay You Will 2003\n\n\n\nLive\n\n\nLive at the BBC 1967 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1971 (1995)\nLive 1980\nThe Dance 1997\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits \n\n\nGreatest Hits 1971\nGreatest Hits 1988\n25 Years: The Chain 1992\nThe Very Best of Fleetwood Mac 2002\n\n\n\n\n\nCompilations \n\n\nEnglish Rose 1969\nThe Pious Bird of Good Omen 1969\nRumours Outtakes 1977\nThe Vaudeville Years: 1968 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1970 (1998)\nThe Complete Blue Horizon Sessions 1967 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1969 (1999)\nThe Chain: 25 Years 1999\n\n\n\n\n\nSolo Work\n\n\n\nMick Fleetwood\n\n\nSomething Big 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStevie Nicks \n\n\nBella Donna 1981\nThe Wild Heart 1983\nRock a Little 1985\nThe Other Side of the Mirror 1989\nTimespace: Greatest Hits 1991\nEnchanted 1998\nTrouble in Shangri-La 2001\nThe Soundstage Sessions 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsey Buckingham\n\n\nBuckingham Nicks (including DemoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s) 1973 (Bootleg -Vinyl)\nLaw and Order 1981\nVacation Soundtrack (2 songs) 1983\nGo Insane 1984\nBack to the Future Soundtrack (1 song) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1985\nWith Honors Soundtrack (1 song) - 1994\nOut of the Cradle 1992\nWords &amp; Music: A Retrospective 1992\nUnder the Skin 2006\nGift of Screws 2008\n\n\n\n\n\nChristine McVie \n\n\nChristine Perfect ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions 1970 (2008)\nChristine McVie 1984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudiochecker Log\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an audiocheck folder present as I ran audiochecker to validate how authentic these lossless albums were. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m glad to report everything looks good although there is an obvious case of some false positives. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t understand why Tango in the Night results came up so poorly using Audiochecker as it was a rip by me using EAC. I then re-ripped Tango in the Night and checked it again with Audiochecker and the same crap results occured. I had a downloaded copy (with log file) of the album and checked that as well and it had, yet again, the same crap results. My rip of Mystery to Me is, according the Audiochecker, 100%. Same with Timespace: Best of Stevie Nicks and Stevie Nicks Soundstage Sessions.\n\n\nSo this just confirms my suspicions of Audiochecker occurring some false positives as I had figured in the past. I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t worry about it if some songs from an album have a MPEG possibility as long as most songs are CDDA then you know its good. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just going to have to trust me on Tango in the Night being authentic since most are MPEG according to Audiochecker.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Big thanks goes out to Demonoid members Oneanight (oan), Wishyouwerehere, Markshan, Loc Blazer, ukras, HellraiserRG, danhigh7, Waynelap and TheFunNun for their Fleetwood Mac contributions. Another  thanks goes out to DLedin &amp; Galemark who did the Buckingham Nicks vinyl rip. Guys, this sounds incredible! Great job and such a fantastic album. Another big thanks goes to the members ofwhere I downloaded many of the older studio albums and compilations. Many were in MonkeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Audio (APE) format so I converted to FLAC. I know my ratio took a massive hit but give it some time and I can seed back what I took!\n\n\n*Note: Some Folders you will notice 2 or even 3 cue files. I left all the cue files in the torrent, the ones that say &quot;cue_cutter&quot; are the new cue files when I converted an ape to flac or had to split the tracks from one large FLAC. Look for these &quot;cutter cues&quot; if your planning to reconvert them in any which way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy this torrent :)\n\n\n\nKitlope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14559ca323fc06711370981252f281949420fa16","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Discography+%26+Solo+works+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14559ca323fc06711370981252f281949420fa16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,85,156,163,35,252,6,113,19,112,152,18,82,242,129,148,148,32,250,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
