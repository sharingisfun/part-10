His cover of the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yer BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ puts to good use the woodshedding he did to pay homage to Jimi on the most recent Experience Hendrix tour. It fuses Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey JoeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-ish elements with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the Levee BreaksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-type groove that undergirds some of his best soloing on the album. His supercharged tone on that track is to die for. Kenny Wayne Shepherd's How I Go not only serves as a strong reminder of the chops that caused Guitar World to place him right behind B.B. King and Eric Clapton on their list of blues guitarists, but it's the strongest indication yet of his gifted songwriting talent. The album pairs Kenny's deeply soulful and impassioned takes on classic material like Bessie Smith's &quot;Blackwater Blues,&quot; Albert King's &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; and The Beatles &quot;Yer Blues&quot; alongside the strongest writing and co-writing of his career thus far. \nThe hard-rocking, blues-based, guitar-driven album sounds young, it sounds fresh. Yet it has that distinctive energy and vibe drawn from the deep heritage of the genre. Kenny Wayne Shepherd is growing as a songwriter, musician and producer. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
