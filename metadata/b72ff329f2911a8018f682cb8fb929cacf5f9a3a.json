It was written by Howard Mackie.\n\nThe &quot;Mutant X&quot; universe (Earth-1298) is a reimagination of the Earth-616 universe. In this continuum, Scott Summers was captured along with his parents by the Shi&amp;#039;Ar and only Alex escaped, allowing him to be the eventual leader of the X-Men. The Mutant X universe reimagines Mr. Fantastic, Nick Fury and Professor X as villains and Doctor Doom and Apocalypse as heroes.\n\nIncluded are 32 issues and 3 annuals.\n\n\nHave Fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72ff329f2911a8018f682cb8fb929cacf5f9a3a","amp;dn":"Mutant+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72ff329f2911a8018f682cb8fb929cacf5f9a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,47,243,41,242,145,26,128,24,246,130,203,143,185,41,202,207,95,154,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
