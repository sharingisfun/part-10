This is particularly true in the Buddhist traditions, which unanimously state that compassion and love are the foundation of all paths of practice. To cultivate the potential for compassion and love inherent within us, it is crucial to counteract their opposing forces of anger and hatred. \n\nIn this book, the Dalai Lama shows how through the practice of patience and tolerance we can overcome the obstacles of anger and hatred.
