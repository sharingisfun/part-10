What would each of those fields look like if we wholeheartedly accepted the existence of not just body and mind but also soul and spirit? \n\nIn a stunning display of integrative embrace, Wilber weaves these various fragments together into a coherent and compelling vision for the modern and postmodern world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570628718/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570628718/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe document is a djvu file.
