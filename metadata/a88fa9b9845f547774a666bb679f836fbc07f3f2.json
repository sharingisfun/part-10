What we eat, what we read, who we elect; every day we make choices that determine how we want to live.\n\nBut what if these choices are just an illusion?\n\nWhy is raw milk illegal to buy or sell, but not to consume? How are pharmaceutical drugs classified as safe by the FDA without any independent testing? And why is the government so eager to bail out some failing companies?\n\nIn an era where regulations and red tape rule every industry, where lobby groups and big business wield more influence than ever before, our daily choices have become increasingly limited.  And with all our options so deliberately hand-picked, are we really making a choice at all?\n\nFreedom From Choice is a feature-length documentary examining the current state of life and personal choice in America today.  Experts from many different fields offer a frank and startling look at the hidden limitations in our daily lives.  Focusing on key areas such as food, medicine, finance, and media, Freedom From Choice provides viewers with a glimpse at the myriad of ways their lives are being dictated, and tells us who stands to gain.\n\nPresented in an entertaining style, Freedom From Choice is a film not about the choices we make, but rather the choices that are being made for us.\n\nWe travelled across the US interviewing experts in key areas of modern life; people with first hand knowledge of these fields and the various rules and regulations that dictate their industry.
