Walthall. A brilliant scientist, Walthall reveals to Barrymore \nthat he has developed a process to shrink human beings. Upon Walthall's death, \nBarrymore makes his way back to the old scientist's lab, intending to use \nWalthall's formula to exact vengeance on those who have wronged him. He does so, \nclearing his name and securing the future happiness of his daughter Maureen \nO'Sullivan (who believes that Barrymore is dead) in the process. But Barrymore's \ncrazed assistant Rafaela Ottiano isn't satisfied. &quot;We'll make the whole world \nsmall!&quot; she hisses, forcing Barrymore to kill her and destroy the formula. To \nsave his daughter from scandal, Barrymore disappears into the night, the \nimplication being that he plans to commit suicide at the first opportunity. The \nexcellent miniature work in The Devil Doll (much of it accomplished with \noutsized sets, a la the Laurel and Hardy comedy Brats) successfully takes the \nviewers' minds off the rather silly plot. Director Tod Browning was always \nstronger with atmosphere than with plot and dialogue, and this film is no \nexception. Far less logical than the miniaturization process is Barrymore's \ndecision to disguise himself as an old woman, since this transparent guise \nwouldn't convince a 2-year-old in real life. Based on the novel Burn, Witch, \nBurn by Abraham Merritt, The Devil Doll was scripted by several hands, including \nErich Von Stroheim.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAST\nLionel Barrymore       - PaulLavond\nMaureen O'Sullivan     - Lorraine Lavond\nFrank Lawton           - Toto\nRobert Greig           - Coulvet\nLucy Beaumont          - Mme.

(If only George Bailey had \nknown his rival's dirty secret! He may have had some leverage.) Barrymore plays \nPaul Lavond, an erstwhile banker framed for embezzlement, who escapes from \nprison along with a mad scientist, Marcel (Henry B. Walthall), who brings Lavond \nto his secret laboratory in the swamp to show off his incredible shrinking \npotion; it can transform anythingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or anyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to pint-size, and also conveniently \nallows the shrinker to control the shrunken's mind. The science is a little \nfuzzy hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½free will depends on the size of our brains?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but before you could \ncall anyone on it the scientist character is killed off (and coincidentally, \nshortly after filming, Walthall died in real life as well), leaving Lavond in \ncontrol of his potions and ripe for revenge against the three slimy bankers who \nset him up, soiled his name, shamed his daughter, drove his wife to suicide, and \nsent him to the clink.\n\nBut, as a jail bird and Public Enemy No. 1, how can he stay in and get around \nParis to exact his vengeance without being re-arrested? How about by opening a \n&quot;doll&quot; shop and dressing as a little old lady? Barrymore is a hoot, but this is \na horror movie, not a comedy and, thankfully, he manages not to allow his \nperformance to become bawdy in that Mrs. Doubtfire/White Chicks sort of way \ncommon to contemporary crossdressing films. (I know, I know, it's a tired \ncomplaint: &quot;they don't make drag queen pictures like they used to!&quot;) In fact, \nheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s often so convincing throughout that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to forget itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even him \nunderneath that costume.\n\nReflecting the dual nature of Barrymore's transvestism, there's a lot of double \nentendre in the dialogue, such as a self-reflexive moment in the final scene as \nwell as a conversation early in the film between Lavond and Marcel's wife. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI \nmay not look it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he tells her, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbut I was once a successful banker.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The \nslumming Barrymore seems to be saying, with gravelly disappointment, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyou may \nnot be able to tell from the silly horror movie IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m in, but I used to be a \nrespected actor of the stage.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Not even B-movies, however, could diminish \nBarrymoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acting prowess, and he gets to show off his range, from his familiar \nMr. Potter scowl to the sweet and funny disposition of an old woman; he is at \nhis best in a hilarious scene in which a police officer comes to ask questions \nand s/he goes into hysterics. &quot;Oh, what will the neighbors say?&quot; he screeches in \na falsetto. Indeed!\n\nLavond shrinks a couple of people, and uses them to kill, paralyze, and torment \nhis foes one by one. The special effects are sophisticated, showing the \nminiaturized assassins with a clever combination of rear projection and \noversized set design. Also notable is that The Devil Doll is somewhat class \nconscious, a rarity for a Hollywood film; for a slight example, while Lavond \nstalks his enemies as the old lady, he's constantly shooed away with disgust and \ndisdain for being a lowly peddler. But while The Devil Doll might seem to be \nsubversive, pro-Soviet agitprop, with its literally ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlittle&quot; guys exacting \njustice by knifepoint on wealthy and powerful bankers, it's actually moreso a \nsubtle shade of anti-Communist, as its mini-killers are the victims of a \nmadman's mind control. Lavond's soldiers are brainwashed slaves, like \nLilliputian Manchurian candidates. \n\n\n\nFrom &quot;And You Call Yourself a Scientist&quot;\n\n\nTwo men make a daring escape from DevilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Island. One is Paul Lavond (Lionel \nBarrymore), a former banker wrongly convicted of murder and embezzlement; the \nother is an obsessed scientist named Marcel (Henry B. Walthall). After weeks on \nthe run, the two succeed in evading the authorities, and reach an isolated house \noccupied by MarcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crippled wife, Malita (Rafaela Ottiano). Marcel is thrilled \nto find that Malita has been continuing with their work, telling her that he has \nthought of a way of solving the problem that has been hampering the experiments. \nLavond follows Marcel and Malita to their laboratory. There, Malita displays a \nnumber of tiny dogs that Lavond assumes are toys. He is shocked when Marcel \ninsists that they are real dogs, shrunk to one sixth of their normal size. \nUnfortunately, the shrinking process damages the brain of the animals: they \ncannot think for themselves, but they can be controlled by the will of others, \nsomething Marcel demonstrates for the astonished Lavond. Marcel tells Malita \nthat he has thought of a way of preserving the brain during the shrinking \nprocess, and goes on to explain his plan of shrinking people, so that their food \nneeds will be similarly reduced, thus combating world hunger. Malita invites \nLavond to stay with them, but he reveals his plan of revenge against the three \nmen who framed him, saying he must leave soon. That night, Lavond is woken by \nnoises downstairs. He enters the laboratory to find that Marcel has reduced the \nhouse servant, Lachna (Grace Ford). Like the dogs, she may be controlled by the \nwill of another. Lavond and Marcel clash, with the latter suffering a heart \nattack. Distraught by MarcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, Malita begs Lavond to stay and help her \ncarry on the work. A plan begins to take shape in LavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. In Paris, \nCoulvet (Robert Greig), Radin (Arthur Hohl) and Matin (Pedro de Cordoba), \nLavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former partners, meet to discuss LavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s escape from prison. They \nagree to offer a large reward for his capture. The police search is in vain, \nhowever, as Lavond has assumed another identity: that of &quot;Madame Mandelip&quot;, a \ndollmaker with a shop in the Parisian backstreets. In this guise, Lavond visits \nRadin, demonstrating a &quot;toy&quot; horse and asking him to invest in &quot;her&quot; business. \nRadin visits the shop, where Lavond shows him Lachna, now dressed as an Apache. \nPointing out the detail in the &quot;dollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s&quot; costume, Lavond shows Radin a tiny \nstiletto ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ then stabs him in the thigh with it. The knife was dipped in a \nsubstance that paralyses its victim. As Malita gleefully contemplates shrinking \nRadin, Lavond ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as Madame Mandelip - goes to see his daughter, Lorraine (Maureen \nOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Sullivan), who is working in a laundry in order to support herself and her \ngrandmother. Although she is in love with Toto (Frank Lawton), Lorraine has \nrefused to marry him because of her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disgrace, and her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suicide. \nLavond visits his mother (Lucy Beaumont), to whom he has already revealed \nhimself. He tells her that he plans to tell Lorraine who he is, but when \nLorraine arrives she speaks of him so bitterly that he changes his mind. \nInstead, Lavond begins the next phase of his revenge, visiting the home of M. \nCoulvet, to sell his wife a &quot;doll&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nComments: An interesting if not entirely successful mixing of genres, Tod \nBrowningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Devil-Doll ends up being more of a hoot than a shiver-fest. \nScience fiction, horror, revenge drama and sickly sentimentality jostle each \nother throughout; and unfortunately for genre fans, it is the latter two that \nfinally win out. The film opens promisingly enough with Paul Lavond and his \nfellow escapee slogging through the swamps with bloodhounds in close pursuit. \nFrom here the story plunges into the bizarre tale of Marcel and Malita. \nExplaining life on DevilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Island, Lavond tells Malita that to survive, a man \nmust have something to focus upon. For himself, it was his revenge, while for \nMarcel it was &quot;science&quot;. Indeed. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve gotta love a man whose first words to \nhis wife after escaping from prison are &quot;The work! The work!&quot; A quick embrace \nlater, and the two are back in the lab, ranting about &quot;perfect brains&quot; and &quot;no \nmore failures&quot;. Yeah, right. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve all heard that before, havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t we? MarcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nplan is to shrink all living things on Earth, in order to cure world hunger. \n(All things, Marcel? Oh, dearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.) However, up until now the shrinking process has \nleft the subjects blank-minded, with no memory and no will. Just to demonstrate \nwhat a pair of humanitarians they are, Marcel and Malita test out MarcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new \ntheory on Lachna, the &quot;inbred peasant half-wit&quot; unfortunate enough to be \nemployed as their servant. We never do see the actual shrinking process, but it \nseems to involve a chemical &quot;mist&quot;, plus a great deal of cotton wool. Similarly, \nMarcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scheme for maintaining normal brain function after reduction is \nundisclosed, although we are told that he has &quot;repaired&quot; LachnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brain. The \nfact that Lachna, like the dogs, is incapable of independent action is therefore \nsomewhat confusing; and tragically, before we can get an explanation one way or \nthe other, Marcel keels over with a heart attack. Malita immediately devotes \nherself to fulfilling MarcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plan for &quot;making the whole world small&quot;, and \ntries to recruit Lavond to the cause. Although repulsed, in your typically \nnarrow-minded layperson way, by what he has observed, Lavond begins to see \npossibilities in MalitaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to shrink and control human beings; and he \nlures her to Paris by promising that he will help her once his revenge on his \nformer partners is complete.\n\nOnce the story moves to Paris, The Devil-Doll loses much of its appeal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or \nperhaps thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just me. In place of our loony scientistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ endless ranting, we \nget Paul Lavond in drag, doing a &quot;sweet little old lady&quot; routine for the benefit \nof his chosen victims, the police, and even his own family. Things really lose \nsteam when the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s focus shifts from LavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revenge plot to his attempts to \nreconcile with his estranged daughter, Lorraine. Given The Devil-DollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brief \nrunning time, far too long is spent detailing the repercussions of LavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nimprisonment on his family, particularly since this involves the clumsy \ncinematic convention of having characters tell each other in detail what they \nmust already know. (Our only relief from this is the occasional reappearance of \nMalita, who stops by from time to time to do a bit more ranting before, as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d \nexpect, blowing her lab and herself up with what I can only assume was an Atomic \nGrenadeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©.) Things pick up when Mme MandelipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;dolls&quot; swing into action. The \nfirst of LavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s three victims is lured to the shop, immobilised, and shrunk, \nfinally becoming one of the tools of revenge himself. The attack upon the second \ninvolves the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most lengthy and elaborate sequence of special effects as \nLachna, following LavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mental orders, empties out Mme CoulvetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jewellery \nbox before attacking Coulvet himself with her poisoned stiletto. These events \nnot surprisingly unnerve the final victim, Matin, who receives a cryptic \nanonymous note telling him at what time his own fate will be decided. Matin \nsurrounds himself with guards, but to no avail. In one of the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cleverest \nideas, we see that the miniaturised Radin has already been smuggled into MatinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nhouse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and is hanging from his Christmas tree amongst the other ornaments. As \nthe hour named in the note approaches, so does Radin; but as he raises his tiny \nknife to strike the fatal blow, Matin snaps, denouncing himself and the others, \nand declaring Lavond innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted. At this \npoint, everything looks set for a more than usually predictable happy ending ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \nexcept that it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite work out that way. Unexpectedly, Paul Lavond turns \nout to be a man with an unusually developed sense of justice. Although not \nguilty of the crimes for which he served his prison term, he is guilty of \ndestroying the lives of both Radin and Coulvet, and for this condemns himself to \nnever rejoining his family. In this day and age, when any action film &quot;hero&quot; can \nblow away half a city in an attempt to clear his name, then simply shrug off the \nbody count and resume his normal life, this attitude is as refreshing as it is \nstartling. More startling still, in 1936, is LavondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ultimate fate. Having \nreassured himself that LorraineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future is secure, Lavond makes a speech that \nimplies, without spelling out, his intention of killing himself. Given the \nLegion of DecencyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s absolute ban on &quot;suicide in plot resolution&quot;, it is quite \namazing that the final scenes were allowed to stand. Perhaps suicide is only \nsuicide if it happens onscreen.\n\nThe Devil-Doll was Tod BrowningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s penultimate film, and feels like it. After \nFreaks, Browning was clearly being kept on a short leash: despite the bizarre \nstoryline, the film lacks that feeling of pleasure in the macabre that informed \nall of BrowningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earlier works. Similarly, there is no sense at all of the \npresence of Erich von Stroheim ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ another MGM casualty. In short, the film is \nnever what you feel it should have been; and its pleasures are incidental. In \nfull Mrs Doubtfire mode, Lionel Barrymore hams it up shamelessly in his dual \nrole. Whether or not you enjoy The Devil-Doll may well depend upon how much of \n&quot;Madame Mandelip&quot; you can stomach. Speaking personally, I find a little of &quot;her&quot; \ngoes a long way. For me, the real fun of this movie comes early on, with the \noutrageous performances of Henry B. Walthall and Rafaela Ottiano as a pair of \nhappily married mad scientists. Between them, Walthall (best known for playing \n&quot;The Little Colonel&quot; in D.W. GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Birth Of A Nation) and Ottiano \nalmost manage to make BarrymoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance seem subtle. Ottiano in particular \nis a laugh riot. With a dramatic streak of white in her hair, stumping about the \nlab with a single crutch, the actress conveys her characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obsession by \nclenching her teeth, contorting her mouth, and opening her eyes as wide as she \npossibly can ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ usually while looking down, which is kind of freaky. Once this \ntrio has finished dining on the furniture, there isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t much that the rest of the \ncast can do. Of the supporting players, Maureen OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Sullivan stands out, but as \nmuch for the incongruity of her immaculately clipped British accent as for her \nperformance. As you would expect, the quality of the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s special effects is \nhighly variable. The superimposition work is generally poor, and is further \nhampered by problems of scale: poor Lachna shoots up and down like Alice in \nWonderland. In contrast, the &quot;doll&quot; scenes that were done by having the actors \ninteract with oversized sets and props show great attention to detail \nthroughout, and consequently they work very well. Leonard SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crisp \ncinematography and Franz WaxmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s score are also assets. Although not a great \nfilm by any means, The Devil-Doll is certainly one of the better entries in the \npantheon of &quot;little people&quot; movies, making an interesting forerunner to the more \novertly science fiction Dr Cyclops, and even to Bert I. GordonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Attack Of The \nPuppet People. Speaking of which, it occurred to me while listening to MalitaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nmelodramatic raving, and watching her make Lachna and Radin dance for her own \namusement, that it was a pity no-one ever introduced her to John HoytÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mr \nFranz. Now that would have been a match made in cinematic heavenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMEDIAINFO REPORT\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.27 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 18mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 331 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2009-02-06 14:00:04\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v2.2.0 ('Turn It On Again') built on \nMar  4 2008 12:58:26\nWriting library                  : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;155d7c727d5559203b24&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nMuxing mode                      : Container profile=&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8dd8e3e6e3e2fae3cdb8a3bc&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 17mn\nBit rate                         : 2 037 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 2 136 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 464 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.379\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.300\nTitle                            : The Devil-doll\nWriting library                  : x264 core 58 svn-736bm\nEncoding settings                : cabac=1 / ref=1 / deblock=1:-2:-1 / \nanalyse=0x3:0x113 / me=hex / subme=5 / brdo=0 / mixed_ref=0 / me_range=8 / \nchroma_me=1 / trellis=0 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / chroma_qp_offset=0 \n/ threads=2 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / mbaff=0 / bframes=16 / b_pyramid=1 / b_adapt=1 \n/ b_bias=0 / direct=3 / wpredb=1 / bime=0 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / \nscenecut=40(pre) / rc=2pass / bitrate=2136 / ratetol=1.0 / rceq='blurCplx^(1-\nqComp)' / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / \nqblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / pb_ratio=1.30\nLanguage                         : English\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nDuration                         : 1h 18mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nTitle                            : English 2.0 Mono\nLanguage                         : English\n\nText\nFormat                           : UTF-8\nCodec ID                         : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info                    : UTF-8 Plain Text\nTitle                            : EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\nLanguage                         : Spanish\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is intended to be played on a PC or a HTPC. If it works on your standalone \nplayer, good for you. You can always convert it to a regular DVD using tools as \nConvertXtoDVD.\n\nSize has been calculated in order to get the optimum PQ without oversizing the \nfile, hence the irregular size of the file (not the usual 700Mb/1.4Gb rip). A \nrate of Bits/(Pixel*Frame) around 0.3 is perfect, above that point, picture \nquality becomes virtually the same to the original source.\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before \ntrying to play it. VLC will play this file without having to install any codec.\n\nIf you don't like the codec(s), container, resolution, file size, languages or \nany technical aspect on this rip, keep it to yourself and if you're able, go and \ndo your own.\n\nSerious feedback on quality will always be welcome.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:866228ab66ba10c6164a2f52565c23fd1f213fb4","amp;dn":"The+Devil-Doll+%28Tod+Browning%2C+1936%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"866228ab66ba10c6164a2f52565c23fd1f213fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,98,40,171,102,186,16,198,22,74,47,82,86,92,35,253,31,33,63,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
