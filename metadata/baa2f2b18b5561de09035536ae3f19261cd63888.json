How did scholars come to identify the sitter as Duke Cosimo deÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Medici and why is this open to doubt? Who was Francesco Guardi? What was the siege of Florence, and could Pontormo have made this compelling portrait during that time of deprivation and political tumult? In a fascinating piece of historical detective work, Elizabeth Cropper investigates these questions and uncovers new evidence for interpretation. She also analyzes the portraitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship to other works by Pontormo, explores the importance for Pontormo of Donatello, Michelangelo, and Andrea del Sarto, and looks into BronzinoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s connection with the portrait.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa2f2b18b5561de09035536ae3f19261cd63888","amp;dn":"Pontormo+-+Portrait+of+a+Halberdier+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa2f2b18b5561de09035536ae3f19261cd63888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,162,242,177,139,85,97,222,9,3,85,54,174,63,25,38,28,214,56,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
