So when the Toronto-based rapper K&amp;#039;naan insists -- as he does in nearly every track on The Dusty Foot Philosopher -- that he has more street-cred and had a tougher upbringing than the next guy, it would be easy to dismiss such braggadocio.\n\nThat is, were it not for the fact that K&amp;#039;naan spent the first 13 years of his life surviving on the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia. Suffice it to say Eminem&amp;#039;s problems with his Mom pale in comparison.\n\nBut a good story does not necessarily a good hip-hop CD make, and The Dusty Foot Philosopher must ultimately stand or fall on its musical merits. Fortunately, negotiating his way forcefully through a gritty sandstorm of spoken-word and African instrumental interludes, K&amp;#039;naan brings us a collection of funky, original backgrounds nearly as weighty as the cautionary words that float above them.\n\nIt all makes for a refreshing new voice that describes the contemporary Canadian experience far more vividly than the multitude of Canucks borrowing sentiments from the streets of New York and L.A. Score another for K&amp;#039;naan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd05fe40afe95d50c9b8fcccfcd38554e9362e61","amp;dn":"K%5C%27naan+-+The+Dusty+Foot+Philosopher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd05fe40afe95d50c9b8fcccfcd38554e9362e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,5,254,64,175,233,93,80,201,184,252,204,252,211,133,84,233,54,46,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
