But all is not well\n\nin the magical world - for one thing, foreign powers are conspiring to take over the\n\nIrish Sanctuary, and for another thing, Valkyrie has discovered she might be the\n\nsorceress set to destroy the world. The problem is, she doesn't feel she can tell\n\nSkulduggery what she's learned... and that's how all the trouble starts. With Valkyrie\n\non a quest of her own, to seal her name and prevent her evil destiny from coming to\n\npass, Skulduggery and the gang are even more vulnerable. Which is a shame, because\n\nremember those thousands of remnants, imprisoned in the Midnight Hotel? Well, now\n\nthey're out. Not only that but they believe Valkyrie is their messiah. And that means\n\nthousands of wicked souls, desperate to get to Valkyrie, willing to kill anyone in\n\ntheir way... Oh, and because they can possess any body, they could be ANYONE. Now\n\nSkulduggery, Valkyrie, Ghastly and Tanith can trust no one. Not even each other..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:377543a212097e7b1b90c7a717558038e3207248","amp;dn":"Derek+Landy%2C+Mortal+Coil%2C+Skulduggery+Pleasant+%235+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"377543a212097e7b1b90c7a717558038e3207248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,117,67,162,18,9,126,123,27,144,199,167,23,85,128,56,227,32,114,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
