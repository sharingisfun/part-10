McNamara\n\nOne of the best documentaries I&amp;#039;ve seen in the last few years.  McNamara, of course, was appointed by John F. Kennedy to be Secretary of Defense.  His tenure lasted on into the Johnson adminstration.  I&amp;#039;ve always heard him characterized as the architect of the Vietnam War, and now you&amp;#039;ll get his point of view.\n\nTo me, the most memorable moment in the film is when McNamara admits he could&amp;#039;ve been tried as a war criminal for his role in firebombing Japan during WWII.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317910/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317910/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI got this from Suprnova just after the DVD was released, so thanks to the original sharer (wherever you may be).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77851e55830ee3bc509b778908bbe928ae21c6db","amp;dn":"The+Fog+of+War+%28Errol+Morris%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77851e55830ee3bc509b778908bbe928ae21c6db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,133,30,85,131,14,227,188,80,155,119,137,8,187,233,40,174,33,198,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
