You take control of one of six Factions each with it's own unique and colorful cast of characters. Each faction has a leader and Rune Knights which can summon a variety of different monsters and lead them into battle, as your Knights and Monsters increase in levels and power they can be upgraded into new and more powerful classes. \n\nIn between battles you will move your knights between cities, send them on quests, have them interact in cut scenes, summon monsters, upgrade your knights and heroes, and plan where and when you'll next attack. Your choices in battle and on the map screen will determine your success or failure, as well as how the story unfolds. \n\nThis game works on PSXeven, which can be downloaded from a link in the readme file. All of the plugins from ePSXe can be used by PSX even, you simply need to copy and paste them into the proper folders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2786e0bf9f104f431757c7210ccc41e14bc23d52","amp;dn":"%28PSX%29+Brigandine+%28USA-NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2786e0bf9f104f431757c7210ccc41e14bc23d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,134,224,191,159,16,79,67,23,87,199,33,12,204,65,225,75,194,61,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
