You won't be limited by on-screen simulations of turntables or CD \nplayers, either -- you can &quot;tweak&quot; any part of your mix creation in a timeline \ninstead. When you've got the mix just the way you want it, you can play it, burn\nit to CD, stream it over the Web, or reshape it in real-time for live \nperformances.\n\n[Optional]\nGEAR Driver: used for CD burning capabilities. There are much better \nalternatives that are free &amp; stealth like &quot;ImgBurn&quot;. But if you insist, GEAR\nis included as a separate install.\n\n[Note]\nKaspersky Anti-Virus falsely identifies as &quot;Keylogger&quot; because MixMeister\nuses hotkeys.
