Supports both English and Russian and lacks any viruses. Previous upload was broken and I can't seem to delete it, download this one instead.\n\n======================install instructions=========================================\n\n1. Run setup.exe in the &quot;game&quot; folder to install. If you don't understand the text, click the button that says &quot;RU&quot;. It should change to say &quot;EN&quot; and the installer will be in English.\n2. Once the game is finished installing, copy the contents of the &quot;Update 1.11B&quot; folder from the torrent into where you have installed the game.\n\nYou now have a working and up to date English copy of the game. If you wish to have a Russian copy, perform step 3.\n\n3. Copy the contents of the ÃÂ Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€žÃÂ¸ÃÂºÃÂ°Ã‘â€šÃÂ¾Ã‘â‚¬/v1.2a folder of the torrent into where you have installed the game, and it will switch the language from English to Russian\n\nIf you cannot speak Russian stop at step 2 and continue playing in English, the best language there is.\n\nI don't know what the SteamResources folder does, or why the game defaults to installing in your steam directory. The Russians I got this from probably intended it to be used with some kind of hacked Steam client for some unknown reason. It is possible to launch the game with the steam overlay anyway by just adding the shortcut as a non-steam game so there's not much point in using it.\n\n======================game description=============================================\n\nGenre: Strategy, Indie\nRelease Date: 26 Apr 2013\n$29.99 USD on Steam &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/220660/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/220660/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the game\nStarDrive sets a new benchmark for the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ4X Space StrategyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ genre. Starting with a single planet and a small number of space-worthy vessels, you must venture forth into the galaxy, conquer new worlds, build new colonies and defend your very existence against those who would take what is yours. How you play is your decision. Use diplomacy or brute force. Trade, spy and research your way to galactic domination. Make friends, or create mortal enemiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe heart of StarDrive is its ship design and combat engine.\n\nStarDrive takes a modular approach to ship design, allowing the player to create custom ships where the composition and placement of ship modules really matters to the performance of a ship.. In combat, if your portside armour is taking a beating, then rotate around and show them the starboard side! Hide behind a friendly capital shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shields; warp into and out of the fray, launch fighters, lay mines, and so much more.\nKey Features\n\n    Real time gameplay with a seamless zoom from a grand strategic view to a close-up action view\n    Choose from 8 beautifully rendered alien races or design your own to lead into the stars; interact, negotiate and forge allegiances on your way to victory\n    Expand your empire and colonize all kinds of planets, terraform and populate them and build them into specialized centers of trade or industry\n    Research and unlock an array of technologies to improve your military and industrial capabilities\n    Control your ships with classic real time strategy commands or jump into the fray by taking direct Ã¢â‚¬ËœarcadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ control of any ship in your empire\n    Create your unique ship designs with the modular ship design system and determine your own fate in battle\n    Create custom fleet formations and set rules of engagement in the easy-to-use fleet editor\n    Steal technologies, incite rebellions, or rob your enemies blind with a rich agent-based espionage system\n    Deploy ground troops from orbit to defeat the enemiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ last planetary defenses in ground combat\n    Explore the rich universe that comes alive with random events, remnant elements, hidden treasures, deep space terrors and late-game threats \n\nSystem Requirements\n\n    Minimum:\n        OS:Windows XP\n        Processor:IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â® IV 2.4 GHz or AMD 3500+\n        Memory:3 GB RAM\n        Graphics:NVIDIAÃ‚Â® GeForce 8800 or ATI RadeonÃ‚Â® X1900\n        Hard Drive:2 GB HD space\n        Additional:Please Note: integrated Intel graphic card/chips not supported\n\n    Recommended:\n        OS:Windows 7\n        Processor:2.4 GHz Dual Core Processor or Better\n        Memory:4 GB RAM\n        Graphics:NVIDIAÃ‚Â® GeForce 8800 or ATI RadeonÃ‚Â® X1900 or better\n        DirectXÃ‚Â®:9.0c\n        Hard Drive:2 GB HD space\n        Additional:Please Note: integrated Intel graphic card/chips not supported\n\nIf you like it, buy it.
