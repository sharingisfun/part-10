Contains chapters overviewing Italian, German, French, and Spanish genre cinema, as well as full elaborated chapters on Jess Franco, Jean Rollin, Jose Larraz, Jose Benazeraf, Walerian Borowczyk, and Alain Robbe-Grillet. This book is an absolutely great entrance point to the occasionally overwhelming world of European Genre Cinema. I can't recommend this enough.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ea42b6b133c48d453bd511e345e91c7d170b1f","amp;dn":"Immoral+Tales+-+European+Sex+%26amp%3B+Horror+Movies%2C+1956-1984.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ea42b6b133c48d453bd511e345e91c7d170b1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,234,66,182,177,51,196,141,69,59,213,17,227,69,233,28,125,23,11,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
