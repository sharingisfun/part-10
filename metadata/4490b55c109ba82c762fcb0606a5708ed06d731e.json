Meanwhile, in England, Lord John Morgan feels his spirit weaken, so he returns to America to live again with the Yellow Hand. Finding them dispirited, he invigorates them as well as himself through self-imposed torture and other rituals. Once he convinces the clan to take direct action, Horse must devise a strategy to take the trappers' fort. The clan's women and boys take on special assignments to aid the assault to regain the sacred land.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4490b55c109ba82c762fcb0606a5708ed06d731e","amp;dn":"The+Return+of+a+Man+Called+Horse+%281976%29++R.+Harris+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4490b55c109ba82c762fcb0606a5708ed06d731e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,144,181,92,16,155,168,44,118,47,203,6,6,165,112,142,208,109,115,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
