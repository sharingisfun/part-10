This new feature simplifies getting Kali installed and running on more recent hardware which requires EFI as well as various Apple MacBook Air and Retina models. Besides the addition of EFI support, there is a whole array of tool updates and fixes that have accumulated over the past couple of months. As this new release focuses almost entirely on the EFI capable ISO image, Offensive Security won't be releasing additional ARM or VMWare images with 1.0.8. As usual, you don't need to re-download Kali if you've got it installed, and apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade should do the job","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da43f151d016a461c42b8a7ff2cda6b7ebe23bdf","amp;dn":"Kali+Linux+1.08+i386","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da43f151d016a461c42b8a7ff2cda6b7ebe23bdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,67,241,81,208,22,164,97,196,43,138,127,242,205,166,183,235,226,59,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
