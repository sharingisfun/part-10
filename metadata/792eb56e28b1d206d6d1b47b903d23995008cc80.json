Dodd is telling us about his research into the tax-exempt organization and what they REALLY stand for. He shows us that the Carnegie Endowment, the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation joined together to alter American history and take over the whole education system in America, so the children can be indoctrinated into accepting a World Government.\n\n\nRun Time: 50 minutes\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.tv\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792eb56e28b1d206d6d1b47b903d23995008cc80","amp;dn":"The+Hidden+Agenda+For+World+Government+%5BAVI+-+NWO+-+Rockafeller%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792eb56e28b1d206d6d1b47b903d23995008cc80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,46,181,110,40,177,210,6,214,209,180,123,144,61,35,153,80,8,204,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
