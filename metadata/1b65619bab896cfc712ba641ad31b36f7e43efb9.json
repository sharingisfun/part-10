Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just for self-defense,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ King assured him. One of KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advisors remembered the reverendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home as Ã¢â‚¬Å“an arsenal.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Like King, many nonviolent activists embraced their constitutional right to self-protectionÃ¢â‚¬â€yet this crucial dimension of the civil rights struggle has been long ignored.\n\nIn This Nonviolent StuffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Get You Killed, civil rights scholar Charles E. Cobb, Jr. reveals how nonviolent activists and their allies kept the civil rights movement alive by bearingÃ¢â‚¬â€and, when necessary, usingÃ¢â‚¬â€firearms. Whether patrolling their neighborhoods, garrisoning their homes, or firing back at attackers, these men and women were crucial to the movementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success, as were the weapons they carried. Drawing on his firsthand experiences in the Southern Freedom Movement and interviews with fellow participants, Cobb offers a controversial examination of the vital role guns have played in securing American liberties.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b65619bab896cfc712ba641ad31b36f7e43efb9","amp;dn":"This+Nonviolent+Stuff%27ll+Get+You+Killed+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b65619bab896cfc712ba641ad31b36f7e43efb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,101,97,155,171,137,108,252,113,43,166,65,173,49,179,111,126,67,239,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
