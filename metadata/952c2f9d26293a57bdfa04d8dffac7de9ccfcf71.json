It's a series that candidly reveals the world of those who walk the thin blue line. \n\nWe follow five officers from their first day on the streetsÃ¢â‚¬â€as they're plunged into the world of big-city policing, where even the smallest mistake can have life-or-death consequences.\n\nThe heart of this close-knit group is 26-year-old Andy McNally. Andy's dad was a cop. Not the best cop maybeÃ¢â‚¬â€he retired under a cloud, though Andy has yet to find out why. And not the best dadÃ¢â‚¬â€lately she's been spending a lot of time picking him up off the floor, and taking the Scotch bottle out of his hands. Still, all she ever wanted to be is a cop. \n\nAndy's a born rescuer, but she joined the force not just to help people but to discover a sense of family she's never had. And sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely found it among her fellow traineesÃ¢â‚¬â€a group of young, ambitious twenty-somethings, carrying big guns and even bigger emotional baggage.\n\nThese five rookies trained at the Academy togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€they learned the rules togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€they fought, drank and slept together. Now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re walking the beat together, learning the toughest kind of policing there is. They're the first responders. First on the scene, never knowing what dangers they're about to face. They're the officers walking into dark doorways without knowing whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind them. The police who get shot during routine traffic stops. The cops who never know whether their shiftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to bring them a dead body, a violent home invasion, a john sweep, or a drug raid.\n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re making mistakes, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to get ahead, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to watch each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backs while proving they can do this on their own. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re falling in love. Dealing with messy stuff at home. Learning to trust their instinctsÃ¢â‚¬â€since they don't have experience to fall back on.\n\nAnd theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing all this as they learn first-hand the hardest kind of policing there is.\n\nRookie Blue is a drama about the trials and triumphs, competition and camaraderie of this rookie family, who are about to learn the hard way that no amount of training can prepare them for the jobÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or for life.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll files are MP4's previously uploaded by other individuals, I just grouped them together to make it easy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:952c2f9d26293a57bdfa04d8dffac7de9ccfcf71","amp;dn":"Rookie+Blue+Season+3+Completed%28.mp4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"952c2f9d26293a57bdfa04d8dffac7de9ccfcf71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,44,47,157,38,41,58,87,189,250,4,216,223,250,199,222,156,207,207,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
