Kurose, Keith W. Ross\n\nDescription:\nBuilding on the successful top-down approach of previous editions, the Sixth Edition of Computer Networking continues with an early emphasis on application-layer paradigms and application programming interfaces (the top layer), encouraging a hands-on experience with protocols and networking concepts, before working down the protocol stack to more abstract layers.\n\n\nThis book has become the dominant book for this course because of the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reputations, the precision of explanation, the quality of the art program, and the value of their own supplements.\n\n\nNote: Some pages may be missing and some pages may be included twice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fec7cf4d6340514b0bd73b14906109d40f6bedd","amp;dn":"Computer+Networking+A+Top+Down+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fec7cf4d6340514b0bd73b14906109d40f6bedd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,236,124,244,214,52,5,20,176,189,115,177,73,6,16,157,64,246,190,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
