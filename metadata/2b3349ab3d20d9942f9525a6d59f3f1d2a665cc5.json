The Heart Throbs - Cleopatra Grip\n\n\nThe debut album by Liverpool&amp;#039;s Heart Throbs (led by the twin sisters of late Echo &amp; the Bunnymen drummer Pete DeFrietas) slots neatly into the overriding musical styles of U.K. indie pop circa 1990, mixing the post-punk directness of the Primitives, the swirling, dreamlike textures of the shoegazers, and the flirtations with dance rhythms introduced by the previous summer&amp;#039;s Madchester explosion. However, the Heart Throbs definitely had their own unique style; for one thing, singer Rose Carlotti&amp;#039;s lyrics, from the suggestive album title on down, are forthrightly female-centric in the manner of the Au Pairs&amp;#039; Lesley Woods or early PJ Harvey. It can be difficult to hear Carlotti behind Martin Hannett&amp;#039;s echoey, hollow production, which shifts the guitars to the forefront, but the intent of songs like &quot;She&amp;#039;s in a Trance&quot; and the searing, My Bloody Valentine-like &quot;Kiss Me When I&amp;#039;m Starving&quot; remains clear regardless. The slightly poppier singles &quot;Tossed Away&quot; and &quot;Dreamtime&quot; are the album&amp;#039;s highlights but, while a couple of the songs coast by simply on atmosphere, Cleopatra Grip is a luxurious and compelling listen.\n\n\n\n01. Tossed Away                                                                                                         \n02.

Big Commotion (Remix)                                                                                               \n04. In Vain                                                                                                             \n05. Slip And Slide                                                                                                      \n06. Here I Hide (Remix)                                                                                                 \n07.

I Wonder Why                                                                                                        \n09. She&amp;#039;s In A Trance                                                                                                   \n10. Blood From A Stone (Remix)                                                                                          \n11. Kiss Me When I&amp;#039;m Starving                                                                                           \n12. White Laughter                                                                        \n\n\nLabel: One Little Indian\nReleased: Aug 1990\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Heart Throbs - Vertical Smile\n\n\nTheir third album is Vertical Smile (1993-One Little Indian). This album is harder and more raw than the others. Both the lyrics and music show a lot of anger. There are several good songs, but not as memorable as on their prior efforts. I can&amp;#039;t recall hearing any fans claiming this as their favorite HT disc (but there are probably a few). \nThis one was never released in the U.S. and can be a real challenge to find.\n\n\n\n01.
