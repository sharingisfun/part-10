He is, by the accout of his peers as well as artists today, the father of American popular music. I looked through racks of CDs for almost an hour, and this is the best single-disc compillation that has been produced of his work. It starts with the classic &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; and features other popular songs such as &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; (popularized by Bobby Darin) and &quot;Gone Fishin'&quot; (duet with Bing Crosby). It also has other fifteen other Armstrong favorites that I never would have known were favorites without reading the highly informative CD jacket. I have no idea how anyone who likes music could dislike this album and I think that Satch's &quot;All Time Greatest Hits&quot; is a great buy for those who are conisseurs of his music, as well as for those who have no exposure at all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ae1a5f4b28db42ab65568791ecbe4bb9c5a2937","amp;dn":"Louis+Armstrong%27s+All-Time+Greatest+Hits+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ae1a5f4b28db42ab65568791ecbe4bb9c5a2937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,225,165,244,178,141,180,42,182,85,104,121,30,203,228,187,156,90,41,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
