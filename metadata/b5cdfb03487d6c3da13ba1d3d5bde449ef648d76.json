Statements from an anonymous source claiming to be close to Dr. Ted Loder and Jan Bravo allege that Dr. Greer has been skimming money from Sirius and The Orion Project donations for his own personal use - which are said to include real estate, drugs and sex with underage boys.  The story is likely a controversial ploy and disinformation tactic to defame everybody named and involved.  \n\nHowever, Alfred Webre does appear to have released a genuine copy of The Orion Project's &quot;Dead Man's Trigger&quot; document that Dr. Greer, Loder and Bravo all talked about on a May 14 2010 edition of their World Puja internet radio program.  A public statement concerning then-recent intelligence agency infiltration of The Orion Project was also released at the same time.\n\n\nScreenshot of Steven Greer's leaked document\n\n--------------------------\n\nMay 14th, 2010 : Dr. Steven Greer\n\nThe Orion Project Update: Intelligence Community claws back prominent scientists working with The Orion Project\n\nDr. Greer has frequently discussed with the World Puja audience the importance/ necessity of New Energy solutions for the world and what The Orion Project is valiantly trying to do to accomplish these goals.
