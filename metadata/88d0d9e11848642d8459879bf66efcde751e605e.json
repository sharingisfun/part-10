It was first released in 1973.\n\nMost of Seven Up was recorded live at the Bern Festival in Switzerland in August 1972. Timothy Leary was living in exile in Switzerland at the time, having escaped from prison in San Luis Obispo, California in September 1970. \n\nSeven Up is often very misunderstood by fans of their music. It's a real odd one to say the least, and if you're familiar with such albums as their 1971 debut, Join Inn (1973), or Inventions For Electric Guitar (1975, actually a Manuel GÃƒÂ¶ttsching solo album) this one is quite a shock indeed.\n  \nThe album starts off with &quot;Space&quot;. It's a suite divided in to four movements. It starts off with &quot;Downtown&quot;, which doesn't sound too encouraging. It sounds like downright generic blues sung by a female vocalist, but never let that deceive you. You quickly face some truly mind blowing spacy electronic effects and noise that never lets up! It's pretty much the same throughout, although three more blues songs will follow, but as always, the blues songs never last because it sounds like the band was just so stoned at the time, they'd rather blow people's mind. I can sense quite a bit of irony in the way the band played those blues numbers.\nThanks to the presence of Timothy Leary (who was in exile in neighboring Switzerland), it's no surprise that this music is the effects of an LSD trip. The second half of the album is taken up by a three movement suite called &quot;Time&quot;. Here's where detractors of the album finds its redeeming qualities, as this is very much like like Alpha Centauri-era Tangerine Dream. The last movement of &quot;Time&quot; is &quot;She&quot; which is basically a re-recording of &quot;Suche &amp; Liebe&quot; off Ash Ra Tempel's 1972 album Schwingungen. This is a wonderful, and underrated album, which if you approach with an open-mind you'll probably enjoy it.\n\nThe name &quot;Seven Up&quot; was thought up by lyricist Brian Barritt, after the group were given a bottle of the lemonade drink 7 Up that had been spiked with LSD.\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d0d9e11848642d8459879bf66efcde751e605e","amp;dn":"Ash+Ra+Tempel+%28%26amp%3B+Timothy+Leary%29+-+Seven+Up+%2F+1973","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d0d9e11848642d8459879bf66efcde751e605e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,208,217,225,24,72,100,45,132,89,135,155,246,110,252,222,117,30,96,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
