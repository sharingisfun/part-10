It consist of five experienced players coming from the ever growing/regenerated and talented Italian scene. They were/are members of DGM / ASTRA / BATON ROGUE MORGUE / SOLISIA / EVIDENCE / EMPYRIOS. Those bands are more or less related with Simone Mularoni as an engineer/producer or Musician, and of course, the style of majestic Power Metal played by this new outfit is clearly in the same kind as DGM; Progressive/Technical/complex/Powerful with a strong Melodic structure and a great level of skills, with maybe a more vicious down tuned spirit, which is developped in a bombastic darker edge and pessimistic overtones!\nMr. Mularoni also performed a guest guitar solo spot on the track Fallen From Grace,Yet the Roman guitar-hero Francesco MatteiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skills are not underemployed here, because his impressive axe performance both in the extremely syncopated rhythmic/amazing smoking solo side is superb and upscaled at the world class highest point Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Perfect mark!\n\nHowever the real star of the show is vocalist Frank Corigliano who delivered a first rate singing demonstration, with a proficiency of mastery in the testoteronic tenor crooning attitude/some tremendous high pitched-vocals/a few demented screams and also sporadic grunts like an heavenly mix between Mats Leven/Apollo Papathanasio/Samuel Nyman and of course Russell Allen (Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParalisisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Full mark here againÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Indeed the contemporary SYMPHONY X comparison is obvious , the manic Harsh riffing method, the incredible and fierce duels between lead guitar and keyboards in a harmonic minor mood, the subtlility and the precision in the Neo-Classical influenced arrangments,  the insane density in the perfect balance between Symphonic background and the Techno Thrash dynamic like MEGADETH / ANNIHLATOR meets RISING FORCE with reminiscences from TIME REQUIEMÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Clearly it's the same ultra efficient and rewarded recipe already used by DGM in superb albums such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“FrameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Different ShapesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with less Progressive colors and a more dissonant/Industrial flavored tricks borrowed to the Swedish Modern Metal sound instead!\n\nThe only minor low point, is the cover artwork which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ugly, but it looks more like a Z movie DVD or a HELLAMMER cover band than the real high end Modern Progressive Metal that it actually is!\n\nThe release date is set for June 10th and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already in my TOP 20 for 2014Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Strongly and warmly recommended!\n \n\n \t\t00 album art 01.jpg\t        90.41 KB\n \t\t01 The New Age.mp3\t         2.37 MB\n \t\t02 Risen.mp3\t                 8.96 MB\n \t\t03 Downfall.mp3\t                 8.70 MB\n \t\t04 Paralysis.mp3\t         9.43 MB\n \t\t05 Ashes.mp3\t                12.42 MB\n \t\t06 Fear.mp3\t                 9.95 MB\n \t\t07 Fallen from Grace.mp3\t12.72 MB\n \t\t08 Through The Abyss.mp3\t 8.68 MB\n \t\t09 Waste.mp3\t                10.59 MB\n \t\tNoveria - Risen.m3u\t          467 bytes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63b08948ff3a5cb9b5643f0688a5ef768bd4c7df","amp;dn":"Noveria+-+Risen+%28MP3+VBR+-V+O%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63b08948ff3a5cb9b5643f0688a5ef768bd4c7df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,176,137,72,255,58,92,185,181,100,63,6,136,165,239,118,139,212,199,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
