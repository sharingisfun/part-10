He has only visited Europe once in his relatively short, ten-year long recording career, having had performed in Hamburg, Recklinghausen (the Ruhrfestspiele Music Festival), and Paris in early '65. And so it only follows suit that the new tapes from this tour are an absolute collector's item.\n\n\n01. Straight, No Chaser\n02. Just Friends\n03. In a Mellow Tone\n04. We Got Rhythm\n05.
