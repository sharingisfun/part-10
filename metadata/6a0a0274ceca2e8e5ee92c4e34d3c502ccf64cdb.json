It was released December 12, 2011 as a free download on their website, Facebook and Soundcloud as well as being available for purchase on Beatport and iTunes. The EP originally was to feature 'Back to the Z-List' but was replaced with 'Destroy Them With Lazers' as Knife Party no longer liked that track. The album titles refers to a preset in the software synthesiser 'Native Instruments: Massive', which creates the 'talking' sound featured in latest dubstep tracks.\n\n1. \t&quot;Internet Friends&quot;\n2. \t&quot;Destroy Them With Lazers&quot;\n3. \t&quot;Tourniquet&quot;\n4. \t&quot;Fire Hive&quot;\n\nPlease leave a comment if you like what you found here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a0a0274ceca2e8e5ee92c4e34d3c502ccf64cdb","amp;dn":"Knife+Party+-+100%25+No+Modern+Talking+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a0a0274ceca2e8e5ee92c4e34d3c502ccf64cdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,10,2,116,206,202,46,142,94,233,44,78,52,211,197,2,204,246,76,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
