It has sold 495,000 copies in the United Kingdom since its release.\n\nDynamite made her name as the UK's best female garage MC. She was single-handedly responsible for making Sticky's Boo! a top-twenty hit in 2001 and looked set to become the next big thing from the UK's two-step scene. Instead, the 21-year-old North Londoner shipped herself off to New York and made an album of R&amp;B. While A Little Deeper is good it pales alongside competition from artists such as Lauryn Hill, Mary J Blige or the similarly youthful Alicia Keys. Dynamite's natural blend of ragga, hip-hop and garage chat has virtually disappeared to be replaced by a semi-decent nasal singing voice. The only thing that now differentiates Dynamite from her American contemporaries is that she swears more. The addition of played-out US rapper Nas on &quot;Afraid To Fly&quot; is another sign that A Little Deeper is a prepackaged product for American consumption. The album has a couple of outstanding moments, particularly on &quot;Dy-na-mi-tee&quot; when this oldest of 11 brothers and sisters soulfully narrates the tale of her upbringing. &quot;The Natural High&quot; interlude is also spine-tingling as she slips back to her pirate-radio roots in a tirade against drugs. At 55 seconds it's not enough, leaving the album more sparkler than Dynamite. --Jake Barnes\n\n\n&quot;Natural High (Interlude)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:56\n&quot;Dy-Na-Mi-Tee&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n&quot;Anyway U Want It&quot; (featuring Keon Bryce) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:42\n&quot;Put Him Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n&quot;Brother&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n&quot;It Takes More&quot; [Bloodshy Main Mix] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:39\n&quot;Sick 'N' Tired&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n&quot;Afraid 2 Fly&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48\n&quot;Watch Over Them&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:16\n&quot;Seed Will Grow&quot; (featuring Kymani Marley) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n&quot;Krazy Krush&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n&quot;Now U Want My Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:54\n&quot;Too Experienced&quot; 1 (featuring Barrington Levy) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:58\n&quot;Gotta Let U Know&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:09\n&quot;All I Ever&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:31\n&quot;A Little Deeper&quot;/&quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; (Pregap Track) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:25","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c082f5d921a80768db0f70fcdab2207b6ac0949","amp;dn":"Ms.+Dynamite+-+A+LIttle+Deeper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c082f5d921a80768db0f70fcdab2207b6ac0949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,8,47,93,146,26,128,118,141,176,247,15,205,171,34,7,182,172,9,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
