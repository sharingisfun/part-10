Sustaining momentumÃ¢â‚¬â€and remaining a great growth companyÃ¢â‚¬â€takes a system. \nScott Anthony and David Duncan call this system a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Growth Factory.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen it work in a small set of elite companies that have created environments where innovation is both repeatable and reliable, not relegated to an off-site or isolated division that has no real connection to the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future. \nIn this HBR Single, Anthony and Duncan draw on their extensive experience working with these growth factory organizationsÃ¢â‚¬â€most notably Procter &amp; Gamble and Citigroup. They highlight the four main components that make innovation repeatable and reliable, citing real examples of what P&amp;G, Citi, and even their own firm, Innosight, have gone through to stay firmly on a path toward growth despite huge challenges. They offer practical advice on how you can put their system into action in your own companyÃ¢â‚¬â€whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a large multinational or a small start-up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f7c3a48860219d4bc56c4cc318a1ae08dbc1a54","amp;dn":"Building+a+Growth+Factory+by+Scott+D.+Anthony%2C+David+S.+Duncan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f7c3a48860219d4bc56c4cc318a1ae08dbc1a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,124,58,72,134,2,25,212,188,86,196,204,49,138,26,224,141,188,26,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
