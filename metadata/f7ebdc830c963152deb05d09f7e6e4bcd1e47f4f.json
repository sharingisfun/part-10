The player takes the role of mayor of the city. Soviet law and economy have their own laws. Every building influences a terror bar. Be careful, because excessive terror level leads to a rebellion. On the other hand, when terror level is too low, the dictator can replace you with a more appropriate person. Limited materials and people disobedience can cause trouble with implementation of five-year plans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ebdc830c963152deb05d09f7e6e4bcd1e47f4f","amp;dn":"Soviet+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ebdc830c963152deb05d09f7e6e4bcd1e47f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,235,220,131,12,150,49,82,222,176,93,9,247,230,228,188,209,228,127,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
