Of course, other impulse response can be imported and edited as well - in all resolutions and also in True Stereo.\n\nThe IQ-Reverb's centerpiece is its intuitive 3D display - here, processings of the reverb are illustrated. You can change length and envelope of the impulse responses quickly and easily and even treat various frequency ranges of the reverb seperately. With just a mouse click you can also create gated or reverse reverbs.\n\nThe modulation allows you to breathe life into any impulse response. And the positioner is the perfect tool to easily place signals in a three-dimensional space.\n\nAwesome audio quality, unprecedented reverb textures and innovative options combined with easiest handling - all this makes the IQ-Reverb an indispensable tool for your mixes and masterings.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n   convolution reverb with innovative editing capabilities\n   easy handling, clearly arranged display\n   intuitive 3D user interface\n   reverberation time adjustable in 3 frequency ranges\n   cut- &amp; vintage gated reverb\n   reverse reverb\n   modulation for vivid reverb textures\n   positioning of sound sources in virtual space (positioner)\n   True Stereo capable\n   extensive IR and preset library (vintage &amp; high-end studio gear, &quot;real&quot; spaces, layered reverb combinations)\n   user presets can be stored\n   imports 3rd party impulse responses and libraries\n   changeable plugin window size\n   &quot;set as default&quot; preset\n   supports all common sample frequencies\n   PC 32- and 64-bit DAWs\n\n\n\nChangelog HOFA IQ-Reverb\n\n1.0.11: (2013-12-16)\n- Bugfix: Docked browser was always opened with plugin window, even if it was hidden before\n- Bugfix: Parameters could be reset when closing one of multiple instances or changing their order\n- Bugfix: Parameters were reset after Bounce in WaveLab\n- Bugfix: Right channel missing in reverb output when used in mono-&gt;stereo routing\n- Bugfix: Mono IRs did not work when used in stereo channel\n- Bugfix: Stereo file pairs with 32 bit resolution were not correctly imported as 4-channel IR\n- Bugfix: &quot;Drag &amp; drop&quot; mouse pointer was shown while &quot;Load IR file&quot; dialog was open\n- Improvement: Increased size of peak level display\n\n\n\nCompatibility:\n\n   HOFA Plugins work with Windows 7/8, Vista and WinXP\n   VST, VST3, RTAS\n   IQ-Reverb requires a graphics board that supports OpenGL version 3.1 or higher  \n   HOFA Plugins are being tested constantly on the following DAWS:\n   Steinberg Cubase/Nuendo/Wavelab, MOTU Digital Performer, Ableton Live, Apple Logic, Magix Samplitude/Sequoia, Avid Pro Tools 9, 10 &amp; 11, Cakewalk Sonar, Presonus Studio One, Cockos Reaper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      [Installation]\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  UnRar and Install Setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
