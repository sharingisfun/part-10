It includes four main ingredients: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js. In this course, Michael Sullivan shows you what it &quot;means&quot; to develop on the MEAN stack, walking through setup, user authentication and security, routing, controller and view creation, data storage, and moreâ€”all the way up to app deployment. By the end of the course, you'll have a clear picture of the MEAN stack workflow and its many advantages, including enhanced performance and the convenience of using a single programming language across every layer of your application.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\n    Getting your Node.js development environment set up\r\n    Creating an Express application\r\n    Configuring user authentication and strong password hashing\r\n    Accessing MongoDB collections in the shell and with Mongoose\r\n    Building a mini SPA (single-page application) with AngularJS\r\n    Adding custom form validation with AngularJS\r\n    Deploying an app to Heroku","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e195608393ceb88182dd96ff7b0ff61ddd0882f","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Developing+for+the+MEAN+Stack+and+MongoDB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e195608393ceb88182dd96ff7b0ff61ddd0882f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,25,86,8,57,60,235,136,24,45,217,111,247,176,255,97,221,208,136,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
