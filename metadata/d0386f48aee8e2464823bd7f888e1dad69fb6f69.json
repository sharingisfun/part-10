Although it has noticeable British and American sensibilities, the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a multicultural affair with over 2,000 individual articles, including entries for Cheng Hao and Baal Shem Tov along with RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Descartes and Immanuel Kant, and it discusses Mahayana Buddhism as ably as it discusses deconstruction theory.\n\n\n Admirable efforts have been made by the individual contributors (all 1,300-plus of them) to maintain such clarity of presentation as to provide a sophisticated yet accessible intellectual primer that requires only a willingness to learn. This is the philosophic equivalent of the Oxford English Dictionary, doubling as an indispensable reference and a marvelously indulgent splurge.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0386f48aee8e2464823bd7f888e1dad69fb6f69","amp;dn":"Routledge+Encyclopedia+of+Philosophy+10+Vol.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0386f48aee8e2464823bd7f888e1dad69fb6f69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,56,111,72,174,232,226,70,72,35,189,127,136,142,29,173,105,251,111,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
