Their albums consistently sold about 300,000 copies and they were known as outstanding musicians. When Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the band in 1974, they changed their sound and became one of the best-selling bands ever. Until then, this was the only Fleetwood Mac song that charted.\nThis was one of Peter Green's last contributions to Fleetwood Mac. He left the band a year later after a mental breakdown.\nThe single was released in 2 parts. Radio stations usually play the A-side, &quot;Oh Well (part 1).&quot; The B-side is &quot;Oh Well (part 2),&quot; an orchestral piece that sounds completely different. Both parts were written by Peter Green and go together on the album.Mick Fleetwood was sure this would go nowhere. He bet Green that it would tank.Christine McVie was still known as Christine Perfect when they recorded this.The stop and start technique inspired Led Zeppelin to do the same thing on &quot;Black Dog.&quot;\nWidely hailed as one of the best ever blues guitarists from Britain, Peter Green of the original Fleetwood Mac inspired the great B. B. King to say, &quot;He has the sweetest tone I ever heard; he was the only one who gave me the cold sweats.&quot;\n\nUS Chart: 55     UK Chart: 2 \n\nSingles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Billboard (North America)\nYear \tSingle \t                Chart \t      Position\n1970 \t&quot;Oh Well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pt.
