In addition to the existing 34 covered in the first edition, 14 new conditions and symptoms have been added, and these include common, chronic and acute conditions which clinicians may see in their practice. Each chapter contains aetiology and pathology; differential diagnosis according to TCM; selection of treatments with acupuncture and herbs, with explanation of choices; case studies for illustration; summary of Western differential diagnosis; and discussion of prognosis and prevention. This book again brings the enormous wealth of the author's experience, and his insights in applying TCM medicine to a Western context, to the support of all clinicians whatever their own range of experiences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:676a36a3295253a4bb8af504ec120dc0afbf50bc","amp;dn":"The+Practice+of+Chinese+Medicine+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"676a36a3295253a4bb8af504ec120dc0afbf50bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,106,54,163,41,82,83,164,187,138,245,4,236,18,13,192,175,191,80,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
