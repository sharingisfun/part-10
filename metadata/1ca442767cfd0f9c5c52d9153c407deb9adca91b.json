But 87% of the population doesn't care: they're addicted to flashback, a drug that allows its users to re-experience the best moments of their lives. After ex-detective Nick Bottom's wife died in a car accident, he went under the flash to be with her; he's lost his job, his teenage son, and his livelihood as a result.\n\nNick may be a lost soul but he's still a good cop, so he is hired to investigate the murder of a top governmental advisor's son. This flashback-addict becomes the one man who may be able to change the course of an entire nation turning away from the future to live in the past.\n\nA provocative novel set in a future that seems scarily possible, FLASHBACK proves why Dan Simmons is one of our most exciting and versatile writers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca442767cfd0f9c5c52d9153c407deb9adca91b","amp;dn":"Flashback+-+Dan+Simmons.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca442767cfd0f9c5c52d9153c407deb9adca91b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,164,66,118,124,253,15,156,92,82,217,21,60,64,125,235,154,220,169,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
