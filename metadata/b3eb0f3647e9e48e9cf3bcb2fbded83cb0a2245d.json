Tolkien, and with this rich literary resource, the publisher, on the back of developer Surreal Software, has created an action-adventure game in the style of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It authentically presents various chapters of the book that were edited from the movie (or that never made it in) such as the Ancient Forest and the Barrow Downs, and it includes particularly memorable hobbits, characters such as Tom Bombadil, and other secondary but likeable characters.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
