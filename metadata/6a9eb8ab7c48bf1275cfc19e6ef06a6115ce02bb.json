Each song, a little story of heartache, hope and perseverance, seemlessly fusing analogue and digital.Soundtracks to non-existing movies, inspired by the worlds of The Quay Brothers, Hieronymus Bosch, Picasso, Goya, Murnau and Lang.Jason Kohnen (aka Bong-Ra) and Gideon Kiers started TKDE around the turn of the century, creating new soundtracks to existing silent movies such as MurnauÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Nosferatu and LangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Metropolis. Both graduates of the School of Arts and majoring in audiovisuals and multimedia, the audio/visual concept developed into creating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“visualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ music supported by existing film fragments to intensify the audio.The Quay Brothers became a big inspiration for their debut album. Their surreal world combined many weird and wonderful aspects to strengthen TKDEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound.Hilary Jeffrey on trombone joined in 2004, having performed with artists such as Nick Bullen and Patrick Pulsinger, also mastering trombone improvisation. Nina Hitz on cello and Ed Loman on guitar and Lica on vocal improvs form the TKDE live quintet or sextet, with Kiers providing drums, sequencing and visuals and Kohnen the bass, synths and sequencing.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz/Electronic\nLabel:\t\t\tDenovali\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.All Is One\n02.Giallo\n03.White Eyes\n04.Cocaine\n05.Celladoor\n06.Cotard Delusion\n07.Les Etoiles Mutantes\n08.Past Midnight\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it. ****\n\n\n                                                                                                          ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a9eb8ab7c48bf1275cfc19e6ef06a6115ce02bb","amp;dn":"The+Kilimanjaro+Darkjazz+Ensemble+-+From+The+Stairwell+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a9eb8ab7c48bf1275cfc19e6ef06a6115ce02bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,158,184,171,124,72,191,18,117,207,193,158,110,240,106,97,21,206,2,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
