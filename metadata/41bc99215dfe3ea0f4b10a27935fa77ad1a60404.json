The former penal colony's first-generation Irish immigrant population lives in poverty. Having already experienced police brutality and the death of his father, bushranger Ned Kelly is wrongfully imprisoned on the trumped-up charge of stealing a horse. Emerging a few years later, in 1874, Ned is hardened but vows to stay straight. Rejoining his widowed mother and younger siblings, he makes money for his family as a champion bare-knuckle boxer. He also toils as a farmhand on the estate of an English landowner--with whose beautiful wife Ned shares a mutual attraction. But the British colonial system and its Victorian English enforcers remain prejudiced against Australia's working people, and the struggling Kelly family is no exception. When, in 1878, a bullying police officer is rebuffed by Ned's younger sister Kate and targets the family for harassment, Ned and his mother are unjustly charged with attempted murder. Ned is determined to avenge his family's name and strike back against his people's oppressors. While hiding in the bush, he forms a loyal Gang that includes his best friend Joe Byrne. When a chance encounter with the police culminates in three officers killed, the Kelly Gang is forced to go on the run. They blaze a trail through the Outback, robbing banks to fund themselves and giving police the runaround. The Kelly Gang's reputation as invincible outlaws grows, as does nationwide support from their immigrant countrymen. To the masses, Ned is a hero. To lawmen, he is the most wanted man in Australia. When the authorities bring in the formidable Superintendent Francis Hare to capture and/or kill the outlaws, Ned strategizes a risky showdown at the Glenrowan Inn. It is this event which will seal his fate--and his legend.\n\nAlso known as: Ãâ€˜ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ´ÃÂ°Ã‘â€šÃÂ° ÃÂ½ÃÂ° ÃÅ¡ÃÂµÃÂ»ÃÂ¸, Gesetzlos - Die Geschichte des Ned Kelly, Ned Kelly (Comienza la leyenda), Ned Kelly - A tÃƒÂ¶rvÃƒÂ©nyen kÃƒÂ­vÃƒÂ¼li, Ned Kelly: Public Enemy No. 1, Kelijeva banda, Ãâ€˜ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ´ÃÂ° ÃÅ¡ÃÂµÃÂ»ÃÂ»ÃÂ¸ \nCountry: Australia, UK, USA, France\nStudio: The Australian Film Commission, Australian Film Finance Corporation, Endymion Films\nDuration: 01:49:51\n\nInfo:\n\n[mediainfo]\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 49mn\nBit rate : 1 429 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.272\nStream size : 1.10 GiB (76%)\nWriting library : XviD 73\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 49mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 352 MiB (24%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duratio : 500 ms\n\n[/mediainfo]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41bc99215dfe3ea0f4b10a27935fa77ad1a60404","amp;dn":"Ned+Kelly+2003+HDRip+XviD+Heath+Ledger%2C+Naomi+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41bc99215dfe3ea0f4b10a27935fa77ad1a60404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,188,153,33,93,254,62,160,244,177,10,39,147,95,167,122,209,166,4,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
