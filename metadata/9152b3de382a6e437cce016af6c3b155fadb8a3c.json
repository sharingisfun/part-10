Should also work on 32 bit systems, but I haven't tested it. The only reason simcity 2000 will not work on 64 bit systems is because the installer is 16 bit. The game itself is 32 bit and will run on Windows XP x64 and Vista x64.\n\nI have included a registry file containing all the registry entries that the installer would normally add, as well as Simcity 2000 Special Edition. There is NO installer, so if you have had problems with versions of SC2K that must be installed, you should be able to get this one working.\n\nPlease read the included readme in the RAR for install directions. I've tried to make it as easy as possible for newbies, while still allowing customization for people that know what they are doing.\n\nEnjoy (=\n\n\n\n-Arnham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9152b3de382a6e437cce016af6c3b155fadb8a3c","amp;dn":"Simcity+2000+64+bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9152b3de382a6e437cce016af6c3b155fadb8a3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,82,179,222,56,42,110,67,124,206,1,106,246,195,177,85,250,219,138,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
