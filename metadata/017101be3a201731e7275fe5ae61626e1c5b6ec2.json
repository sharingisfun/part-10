The band was formed by guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Tomas Kalnoky and drummer Chris Greer who recruited trumpeter Kevin Gunther, who was working in a local record store. Bassist Josh Ansley, saxophonist Ryan Eldred, and trombonist Jamie Egan, who also was the group's high school band director, rounded out the original lineup. (Kalnoky left after recording their first album, so guitarist Pat Calpin and vocalist Jeff Davidson were recruited for &quot;Alone in a Crowd&quot;. Later, Davidson left the group, and Ryan Eldred took up chief vocal and songwriting duties as well as sax.)\n\n\nThis is a torrent of three of Catch 22's most classic albums :)\n\n\n\n&quot;Keasbey Nights&quot; (1998)\n\n1.
