'Imagine' despite it's notorious attack on Paul McCartney, ('How Do You Sleep?'), felt like a breath of fresh air in 1971; 'Gimme Some Truth' a nasty rocker, 'Oh Yoko' an almost girl-groupish ditty and the lovely 'Jealous Guy' still do. At this point John seemed to know where he was going, and to be going in a good direction.&quot; ***\n- Greil Marcus, Rolling Stone\n\n&quot;Primal goes pop--personal and useful. The title cut is both a hymn for the Movement and a love song for his wife, celebrating a Yokoism and a Marcusianism simultaneously, and &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; unites Lennon unmasked with the Lennon of Blunderland wordplay as it provides a rationale for &quot;Jealous Guy,&quot; which doesn't need one, and &quot;How Do You Sleep?,&quot; which may. &quot;Oh Yoko!&quot; is an Instant folk song worthy of Rosie &amp; the Originals and &quot;I Don't Want to Be a Soldier&quot; an instant folk extravaganza worthy of Phil Spector. &quot;It's So Hard&quot; is a blues. &quot;Crippled Inside,&quot; with its &quot;ironic&quot; good-time ricky-tick, is folk-rock in disguise. And the psychotherapeutically lugubrious &quot;How?&quot; is a question mark.&quot; A\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b09f026a9645dc315f020f1643e267c5e4ba367","amp;dn":"John+Lennon+-+Imagine+%281971+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD-A%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b09f026a9645dc315f020f1643e267c5e4ba367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,9,240,38,169,100,93,195,21,240,32,241,100,62,38,124,94,75,163,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
