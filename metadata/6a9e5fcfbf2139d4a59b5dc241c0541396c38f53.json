(Un)fortunately, the original digitization process appears to\n   have been less than pristine, and I daresay the additional differences introduced\n   by the recompression are, at worst, barely noticeable in comparison. At best,\n   they're a slight improvement, eliminating more old noise than introducing new. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a9e5fcfbf2139d4a59b5dc241c0541396c38f53","amp;dn":"%5BmiHQro%5D+Lucky+Luke+1%2F5-15%2F17-40%2F43-46%2F%26hellip%3B+%281949-2012%7CDgtl%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a9e5fcfbf2139d4a59b5dc241c0541396c38f53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,158,95,207,191,33,57,212,165,155,93,194,65,192,84,19,150,195,143,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
