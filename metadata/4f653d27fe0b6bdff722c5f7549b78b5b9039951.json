The way you begin a sync differs slightly: To sync Mental Case 2, tap 'Start Sync' in the iOS app. Your iOS device should appear in the Mac app in the source list on the left. Select it there, and follow the instructions.\n\nWARNING: At this time, the iOS edition of Mental Case does not support all features of Mental Case for Mac. There is no support for formatted text, no multiple-choice quizzes, and it can only handle a maximum of two facets (sides) per note. An update is planned to address these shortcomings. In the meantime, it may not be suitable for studying all types of notes.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Improved import of learning schedule from Mental Case 1.9\n\n* Added more slide timing options\n\n* Improved layout of multiple choice slides with images\n\n* QuickLook now works with multiple choice slides\n\n* All Notes now shows all stacks, not just top-level stacks\n\n* Small improvements in the Export panel\n\n* Order of stacks in sync panel is now correct\n\n* Fixed a crashing bug when dragging notes in a filtered list\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.7 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f653d27fe0b6bdff722c5f7549b78b5b9039951","amp;dn":"Mental+Case+v.+2.1+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f653d27fe0b6bdff722c5f7549b78b5b9039951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,101,61,39,254,11,107,223,247,34,197,247,84,155,120,181,185,3,153,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
