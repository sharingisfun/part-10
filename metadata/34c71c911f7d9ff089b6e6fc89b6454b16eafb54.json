In early 2003, KRIS DELMHORST, JEFFREY FOUCAULT, and PETER MULVEY toured together in England as an Americana triple-bill. England is a small country and the drives were not long, and it developed that in the afternoons after checking into their hotel rooms theyd pull up chairs, plug in the electric tea kettle, uncase their guitars, and start playing songs. Any song, if it was good, and they hadnt already played it, and they knew the first few lines. Old or new songs, written by other people mostly, jazz ballads or country crooners, blues or Bowie, the Beatles or anything else, all the late greats and plenty of neither, anything as long as it had the right spirit. Something like a poker game played without hard money, and everyone pushing their little pile of strange coins and trinkets, pocket knife or compass, to the middle of the table to be reckoned.\n\n001    \tGreg Brown                    \tShips\n002    \tIrving Mills                  \tMoonglow\n003    \tMark Sandman                  \tPatience\n004    \tBob Dylan                     \tBuckets of Rain\n005    \tJayne-Stewart                 \tThe Whole World Round\n006    \tPeter Mulvey                  \tIthaca\n007    \tPaul Cebar                    \tLovely as the Day Is Long\n008    \tTraditional                   \tMoonshiner\n009    \tDavid Goodrich                \tRedbird Waltz\n010    \tKris Delmhorst                \tLullaby 101\n011    \tWillie Nelson                 \tI Gotta Get Drunk\n012    \tRy Cavanaugh                  \tLighthouse Light\n013    \tR.e.m.                        \tYou Are the Everything\n014    \tYeats-Traditional             \tDown by the Sally Garden\n015    \tL.
