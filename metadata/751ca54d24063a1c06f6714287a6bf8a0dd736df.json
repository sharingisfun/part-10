Her fiery red and yellow photo-manipulated hair and bandaged finger stand in stark contrast to the orderly mysticism conveyed on the front of her previous release, DAYS OF OPEN HAND. Producer MitchellFroom surrounds her strong songs with surprises in instrumentation, arrangement, and mix. The set opens smartly with a couple of selections that stand in stark contrast to the more traditional folk bearing of her previous output. By the third song, &quot;In Liverpool&quot;, things break open to reveal a lushand popish heart. The title song is a dazzling groove of fuzzy and staccato guitar chords cast over layered percussion and her lilting vocal. An array of superb players, includingdrummer Jerry Marotta, guitarists David Hidalgo and RichardThompson, and bass player Bruce Thomas accompany her. While it represented a bit of an unexpected turn at the time of its release in 1992, 99.9 F is one of Vega's finest albums. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 98\nArtist: Suzanne Vega\nAlbum: 99.9 FÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°\nYear: 1992\nGenre: Songwriting\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:751ca54d24063a1c06f6714287a6bf8a0dd736df","amp;dn":"Suzanne+Vega+-+99.9+F+%5BFLAC-1992%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"751ca54d24063a1c06f6714287a6bf8a0dd736df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,28,165,77,36,6,58,28,6,246,113,66,135,166,191,138,13,215,54,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
