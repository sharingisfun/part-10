I. Gurdjieff, Guido von List, Julius Evola, Edgar Cayce, Dion Fortune, and RenÃƒÂ© GuÃƒÂ©non, whose writings often stem from deeper, metaphysical sources, such as sacred texts, prophecy, or paranormal communication. Seeking to unravel and explain the histories and interpretations of Atlantis and its kindred myths of Lemuria and Mu, the author shows how these different views go hand-in-hand with the concept of cyclical history, such as the Vedic system of the four Yugas, the Mayan calendar with its 2012 end-date, the theosophical system of root races, and the precession of the equinoxes. Venturing broader and deeper than any other book on Atlantis, this study also covers reincarnation, human evolution or devolution, the origins of race, and catastrophe theory.\n\nA comprehensive study of the major occult writings on Atlantis \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fully examines the many occult teachings on Atlantis, including those from G. I. Gurdjieff, Madame Blavatsky, Julius Evola, Edgar Cayce, Fabre dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Olivet, and Dion Fortune","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c0100716bb9f85faaa746e624d68551fe1d63d2","amp;dn":"Atlantis+and+the+Cycles+of+Time-J+Godwin%282010%29pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c0100716bb9f85faaa746e624d68551fe1d63d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,1,0,113,107,185,248,95,170,167,70,230,36,214,133,81,254,29,99,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
