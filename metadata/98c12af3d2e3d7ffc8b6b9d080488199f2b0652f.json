Given its first UK release now as a result of the success of that record, The Triumphs And Travails Of Orphan Mae is a comparatively slight work, which nonetheless offers a fascinating glimpse of Veirs' nascent talent.\n\nEven this early on in her career, Veirs' slightly spooked voice conveys a strong sense of place, especially when singing about her beloved wilderness in the American Northwest. And in case you're wondering, no she doesn't vote Republican. Dubbed 'art country' by a local news paper, Veirs sounds a little like Suzanne Vega might have if she'd grown up in such a place.\n\nThe two albums share the same subtly inventive producer in Tucker Martine, string arrangements by Eyvind Kang and a generally sparse, largely acoustic ambience, occasionally illuminated with subtle electronica. But only &quot;John Henry Lives&quot; and &quot;Raven Marching Band&quot; offer flashes of the luminescent imagery she maintains throughout Carbon Glacier. A few of the songs are twee ditties; she's still rhyming 'remember' with 'December' (in &quot;Through December&quot;) and only beginning to find her feet as a singer.\n\nFor Carbon Glacier fans, ...Orphan Mae is a flawed but often fascinating snapshot of Veirs' developing muse. But if you haven't already got the wonderful album her reputation rightly rests on, buy that first.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98c12af3d2e3d7ffc8b6b9d080488199f2b0652f","amp;dn":"Laura+Veirs...The+Triumphs+and+Travails+of+Orphan+Mae%282001%29%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98c12af3d2e3d7ffc8b6b9d080488199f2b0652f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,193,42,243,210,227,215,255,200,182,185,208,128,72,129,153,242,176,101,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
