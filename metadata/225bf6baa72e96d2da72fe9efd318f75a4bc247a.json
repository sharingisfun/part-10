The band was founded by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. The band was credited as one of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig FourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth.\n\nSlayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical traits involve fast tremolo picking, guitar solos, double bass drumming, and shouting vocals. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as death, deviants, suicide, genocide, necrophilia, insanity, Nazism, religion, Satanism, serial killers, and warfare have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the general public. Slayer is best known for speaking through perspective without being necessarily sympathetic to the cause of their inspiration.\n\nSince their debut record in 1983, the band has released two live albums, one cover album, one box set, three DVDs, one VHS, two EPs, and eleven studio albums, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received three Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEyes Of The InsaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and one in 2008 for the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFinal SixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. They have headlined music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance and Ozzfest.\n\nSlayer was formed in 1981 in Huntington Park, Los Angeles, California. The Band was formed by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King when they met at a tryout for a local band. Tom Araya soon joined on bass and vocals, and drummer Dave Lombardo joined last later in 1982. They played in a style reminiscent of early Exodus, influenced heavily by punk acts Minor Threat, Stooges and Heavy Metal bands Venom and Judas Priest.\n\n\n\nMembers:\n\nTom Araya - Vocals, Bass (1982-) (Tradewinds, Quits)\nJeff Hanneman - Guitar (1982-) (Pap Smear)\nKerry King - Guitar (1982-) (Quits, Megadeth)\nDave Lombardo - Drums (1982-1986, 1987-1992, 2001-) (Escape, Sabotage, Testament, Grip Inc., FantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´mas, Voodoocult, John Zorn, Philm, Pap Smear, Apocalyptica)\n\nFormer/past member(s)\nDrums:\nPaul Bostaph (1992-1996, 1997-2001) (Testament, Forbidden (USA), Exodus, Systematic)\n\nBand Discography:\n\nShow No Mercy - Full-length, 1983\nHaunting the Chapel - EP, 1984\nLive Undead - Live album, 1984\nCombat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge - Split DVD / video, 1985\nHell Awaits - Full-length, 1985\nPostmortem - Single, 1986\nRaining Blood - Single, 1986\nAngel of Death - Single, 1986\nReign in Blood - Full-length, 1986\nCriminally Insane - Single, 1987\nSouth of Heaven - Single, 1988\nMandatory Suicide - Single, 1988\nSouth of Heaven - Full-length, 1988\nSeasons in the Abyss - Single, 1990\nSeasons in the Abyss - Full-length, 1990\nDecade of Aggression - Live album, 1991\nDittohead - Single, 1994\nDivine Intervention - Full-length, 1994\nLive Intrusion - Single, 1995\nSerenity in Murder - Single, 1995\nSerenity in Murder - EP, 1995\nLive Intrusion - Video/VHS, 1995\nI Hate You - Single, 1996\nUndisputed Attitude - Full-length, 1996\nSlayer / T.S.O.L. - Split album, 1996\nÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œbernoise - Best of/Compilation, 1998\nDiabolus in Musica - Full-length, 1998\nStain of Mind - Single, 1998\nBloodline - Single, 2001\nGod Send Death - Single, 2001\nGod Hates Us All - Single, 2001\nGod Hates Us All - Full-length, 2001\nWar at the Warfield - DVD, 2003\nSoundtrack to the Apocalypse - Boxed set, 2003\nStill Reigning - DVD, 2004\nEternal Pyre - Single, 2006\nCult - Single, 2006\nChrist Illusion - Full-length, 2006\nEyes of the Insane - Single, 2006\nUnholy Alliance - Split DVD / video, 2007\nPsychopathy Red - Single, 2009\nHate Worldwide - Single, 2009\nWorld Painted Blood - Single, 2009\nFrench Connection - DVD, 2009\nWorld Painted Blood - Full-length, 2009\nLive Intrusion - DVD / Video, 2010\n\nCover:\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
