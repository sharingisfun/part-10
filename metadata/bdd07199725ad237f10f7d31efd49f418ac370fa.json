A member of the &quot;Rat Pack,&quot; Martin\nwas a major star in four areas of show business: concert stage/night clubs,\nrecordings, motion pictures, and television. He was the host of the successful\ntelevision variety program The Dean Martin Show (1965-1974), and subsequently\nThe Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts (1974-1985)\nMartin's relaxed, warbling crooning voice earned him dozens of hit singles\nincluding his signature songs &quot;Memories Are Made of This&quot;, &quot;That's\nAmore&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;, &quot;You're Nobody till Somebody Loves\nYou&quot;, &quot;Sway&quot;, &quot;Volare&quot; and &quot;Ain't That a Kick in the Head?&quot;.\n\nWith art work.\n\n\nThe Very Best Of Dean Martin: The Capitol &amp; Reprise Years\n1998\n\n01  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Gentle On My Mind\n02  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Memories Are Made Of This\n03  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - That's Amore\n04  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Little Ole Wine Drinker, Me\n05  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - The Door Is Still Open (To My Heart)\n06  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Volare (Nel Blu Di Pinto Di Blu)\n07  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - In The Chapel In The Moonlight\n08  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Ain't That A Kick In The Head\n09  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You\n10  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Let Me Go Lover\n11  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Somewhere There's A Someone\n12  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Return To Me (Ritorna-Me)\n13  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - The Naughty Lady Of Shady Lane\n14  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Rio Bravo\n15  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Sway\n16  Dean Martin - The Very Best Of - Powder Your Face With Sunshine\n                                     (Smile!
