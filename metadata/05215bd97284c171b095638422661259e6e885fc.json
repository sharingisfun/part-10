It opens in 1972, as the three are members of an East L.A. gang known as the &quot;Vatos Locos&quot;, and the story focuses on how a violent crime and the influence of narcotics alter their lives. Miklo is incarcerated and sent to San Quentin, where he makes a &quot;home&quot; for himself. Cruz becomes an exceptional artist, but a heroin addiction overcomes him with tragic results. Paco becomes a cop and an enemy to his &quot;carnal&quot;, Miklo.\n\n\n\n\nSubtitles:English,Swedish,Norwegian,Finnish,Danish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05215bd97284c171b095638422661259e6e885fc","amp;dn":"Blood+In+Blood+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05215bd97284c171b095638422661259e6e885fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,33,91,217,114,132,193,113,176,149,99,132,34,102,18,89,230,232,133,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
