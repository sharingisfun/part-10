The compelling argument of this bestselling book is that, thousands of years before Ancient Egypt and Greece held sway, there was a great civilisation whose ships travelled the world and who possessed some knowledge system that offered a unified view of the universe, alien to modern man. In this fascinating exploration of the world at a time when, according to Plato, the 'lost civilisation' of Atlantis was destroyed, the author makes a ground-breaking attempt to understand how these long-forgotten peoples thought, felt and communicated on a universal plane.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af1a10ee9471623dde9061fbdc9e224411ef0f2","amp;dn":"From+Atlantis+to+the+Sphinx+by+Colin+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af1a10ee9471623dde9061fbdc9e224411ef0f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,241,161,14,233,71,22,35,221,233,6,31,189,201,226,36,65,30,240,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
