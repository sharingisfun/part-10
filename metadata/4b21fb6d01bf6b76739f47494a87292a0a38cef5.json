Like its predecessor, it describes the open conflicts of the Reformation from Luther's first challenge to the uneasy peace of the 1560's. Reforming movements in all the principal countries are discussed, against the background of constitutional development and the political struggles of the ruling dynasties. Europe's relations with the ourside world are given due prominence. The second edition incorporates the results of some thirty years of further research and fills some of the gaps, especially in the history of central Europe, which beset the first edition. All chapters wich remain from 1958 have been revised, some very substantially.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b21fb6d01bf6b76739f47494a87292a0a38cef5","amp;dn":"The+New+Cambridge+Modern+History+Vol.+02+-+The+Reformation%2C+1520","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b21fb6d01bf6b76739f47494a87292a0a38cef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,33,251,109,1,191,107,118,115,159,71,73,74,135,41,42,10,56,206,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
