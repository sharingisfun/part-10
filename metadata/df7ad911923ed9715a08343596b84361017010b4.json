The standard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow Long Has This Been Going OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is presented via trio and showcases FlanaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tender touch and HayesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ brush prowess, with WatkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ bass blending perfectly.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEclypsoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, with its Caribbean-flavored head, has Flanagan flowing bebop lines with ease and Sulieman blowing a textured trumpet solo in the Fats Navarro-Clifford Brown style. Kenny Burrell, regarded by many as the midpoint guitar master between Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery, shares the melody line on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSolaciumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (The tuneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title is the Latin word for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“solaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢). This sentiment is especially true of FlanaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and SuliemanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solos.\n\nJohn Coltrane, here in his middle period, begins his improvisation languorously but quickly assures with his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsheets of soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, squeezing flurries of notes from his horn. Burrell follows suit, starting with a blues-drenched statement of empathy, but filling the arc of his solo with double-time finesse.\n\nThe CD closes with a blues, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTommyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s TuneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and tells a similar instrumental story, each player initially mournful but fighting the blue devils of discontent. Rhythm section support is superlative. ColtraneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cries and WatkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sighs during his one solo on the session are a fitting end: only two of these artists, Hayes and Burrell, remain with us today.\n\nTommy Flanagan - piano\nJohn Coltrane - tenor saxophone\nKenny Burrell - guitar\nDoug Watkins - bass\nLouis Hayes - drums\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
