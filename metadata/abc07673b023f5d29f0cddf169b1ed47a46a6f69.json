This Norton Critical Edition collects forty-four fairy tales, from the fifth century to the present.\n\nThe CLASSIC FAIRY TALES focuses on six tale types: &quot;Little Red Riding Hood,&quot; &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; &quot;Snow White,&quot; &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;Bluebeard,&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel,&quot; and presents multicultural variants and sophisticated literary rescriptings.  Also reprinted are tales by Hans Christian Andersen and Oscar Wilde.\n\nThe &quot;Criticism&quot; section of the volumes gathers twelve scholarly essays that interpret aspects of fairy tales, including their social origins, historical evolution, psychological drama, gender issues, and national identities.  A Selected Bibliography is included.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc07673b023f5d29f0cddf169b1ed47a46a6f69","amp;dn":"Maria+Tatar+%28ed.%29+-+Classic+Fairy+Tales+%28Norton+Critical+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc07673b023f5d29f0cddf169b1ed47a46a6f69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,192,118,115,176,35,245,210,159,12,221,241,105,177,237,71,164,106,111,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
