Linz replaced Macaulay Culkin as the central figure. Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance-system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote-controlled toy car. Because of baggage confusion, grouchy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets the car. She gives it to her neighbor, eight-year-old Alex (Linz), just before the spies turn up. The spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car. Home alone with the chicken pox, Alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress, but the spies always manage to elude the police -- while Alex is accused of making prank calls. The spies finally turn their attentions toward Alex, unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby-trap his entire house.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 42 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28574c090640d4eba085b26789697d0c0d676869","amp;dn":"Home+Alone+3%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28574c090640d4eba085b26789697d0c0d676869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,87,76,9,6,64,212,235,160,133,178,103,137,105,125,12,13,103,104,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
