If I recall correctly, the last\ntime Stevie toured Europe must have been well over a decade ago, which was also the last\ntime I saw him sing and play live. A lot has changed since then ~ our leaders, our country, the\nworld we live in. Stevie's music, however, hasn't.\n\nA quick look at the back cover of this Blu-ray disc was all I needed to know exactly what to\nexpect from Stevie Wonder: Live at Last: &quot;Part-time Lover&quot;, &quot;I Wish&quot;, &quot;I Just Called To Say I\nLove You&quot;, &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot;, &quot;Lately&quot;, these are not just some of Stevie's greatest hits, these\nare some of the greatest hits of the 80s and 90s.\n\nStevie's singing throughout the show is relaxed, even casual. At times, it seems like he is\nactually enjoying his own voice. During the breaks, he smiles, jokes and chats with the\naudience, making sure that everyone is having a good time.\n\n\nContrary to what you are likely to see published online, the selection of songs Stevie\nperforms is very good. Opening the show is a chic intro that effectively warms up the crowd\n[Stevie does a lovely bluesy piece with his harmonica]; then come &quot;As If You Read My Mind&quot;,\n&quot;Master Blaster [Jammin']&quot;, &quot;Did I Hear You Say You Love Me&quot;, &quot;All I Do&quot;, etc.\n\nStevie is assisted by a terrific 14-piece band, which includes his beautiful daughter Aisha on\nbacking vocals. Halfway through the show, she sings the powerful &quot;I'm Gonna Laugh You\nRight Out Of My Life&quot;. Earlier there is a terrific &quot;UK medley&quot; comprised of &quot;London Bridge Is\nFalling Down&quot;, &quot;Fool On The Hill&quot;, &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;, and &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.\n\n&quot;Superstition [So What The Fuss]&quot; and &quot;As&quot; are the final two songs in Stevie Wonder: Live at\nLast. The former gets most everyone at the O2 Arena dancing [multiple cameras zoom over\nthe ecstatic crowds], while the latter gives the band one last chance to shine.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/50314613224994848468.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/50314613224994848468.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/78959020559773782077.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/78959020559773782077.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32226838456602919343.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32226838456602919343.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72996803444125529147.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72996803444125529147.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/40810519300468285536.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/40810519300468285536.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66639783908290664845.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66639783908290664845.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
