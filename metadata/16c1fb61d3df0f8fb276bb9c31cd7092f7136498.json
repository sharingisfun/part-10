This documentary \ninvestigates one of the many brutal civil wars that were being raged\nacross Africa. Liberia: An Uncivil War follows reporters, Jonathan\nStack and James Barbazon as they investigated the power struggle\nbetween the rebel movement LURD (Liberians United for Reconciliation\nand Democracy) and President Charles Taylor as it reached its climax\nwith the imminent capture of Liberian capital Monrovia in the summer\nof 2003. While Stack followed the besieged government, Brabazon\nentrenched himself with rebels as they advance on Monrovia. \n(From the US, in English)\n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c1fb61d3df0f8fb276bb9c31cd7092f7136498","amp;dn":"Liberia+-+An+uncivil+war+%282004-TVRip-d0x%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c1fb61d3df0f8fb276bb9c31cd7092f7136498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,193,251,97,211,223,15,143,178,118,187,156,49,205,112,146,247,19,100,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
