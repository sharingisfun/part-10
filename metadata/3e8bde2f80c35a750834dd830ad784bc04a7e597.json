Yan | English | ISBN: 3642208347 | 2011 | 500 pages | PDF | 5 MB\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n&quot;Principles of Compilers: A New Approach to Compilers Including the Algebraic Method&quot; introduces the ideas of the compilation from \nthe natural intelligence of human beings by comparing similarities and differences between the compilations of natural languages and \nprogramming languages. The notation is created to list the source language, target languages, and compiler language, vividly illustrating \nthe multilevel procedure of the compilation in the process. The book thoroughly explains the LL(1) and LR(1) parsing methods to help readers to \nunderstand the how and why. It not only covers established methods used in the development of compilers, \nbut also introduces an increasingly important alternative Ã¢â‚¬â€ the algebraic formal method. \nThis book is intended for undergraduates, graduates and researchers in computer science. \nProfessor Yunlin Su is Head of the Research Center of Information Technology, Universitas Ma Chung, Indonesia and Department of Computer Science, \nJinan University, Guangzhou, China. Dr. Song Y. Yan is a Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Institute for Research in \nApplicable Computing, University of Bedfordshire, UK and Visiting Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, USA.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e8bde2f80c35a750834dd830ad784bc04a7e597","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Compilers-+A+New+Approach+to+Compilers+Including+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e8bde2f80c35a750834dd830ad784bc04a7e597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,139,222,47,128,195,90,117,8,52,221,131,10,215,132,188,4,167,229,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
