He doesn't call me that, though. He would never refer to me so informally, if he referred to me at all. No, he'll barely even speak to me.\n\nBut he still won't leave me alone.\n\nWe were best friends once. Then he turned on me and made it his mission to ruin my life. I've been humiliated, shut out, and gossiped about all through high school. His pranks and rumors got more sadistic as time wore on, and I made myself sick trying to stay out of his way. I even went to France for a year, just to avoid him.\n\nBut I'm done hiding from him now, and there's no way in hell I'll allow him to ruin my senior year. He might not have changed, but I have. It's time to fight back.\n\nI'm not going to let him bully me anymore.\n\n***This novel contains adult/mature young adult situations. It is only suitable for ages 18+ due to language, violence, and sexual situations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b596079c84096dc7c58c250dd79c03243a377be3","amp;dn":"Penelope+Douglas+-+Bully+%28Fall+Away+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b596079c84096dc7c58c250dd79c03243a377be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,150,7,156,132,9,109,199,197,140,37,13,215,156,3,36,58,55,123,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
