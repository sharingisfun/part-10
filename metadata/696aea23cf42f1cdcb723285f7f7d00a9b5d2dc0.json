Users customize Windows by using visual styles (skins) created for WindowBlinds. WindowBlinds skins virtually every aspect of the Windows GUI that one can imagine. And in fact, the enhanced visual styles used by WindowBlinds can skin things previously not thought to be skinnable such as logon/logoff dialogs, the &quot;please wait&quot; dialog, backgrounds in the Control Panel and other special folders, and more. Latest version works with Windows 7/8 and Windows Server 2008 R2/2012.\n\n Visual Styles\n Select from the many skins included with WindowBlinds or choose from thousands of skins available for download at WinCustomize.com\n\n Alternative Skins\n Some skins have multiple sub-styles that can be applied to suit your personal tastes. You can also save your style combinations as presets for quick access later.\n\n Modify Skins\n Personalize any of the default Windows themes or any skins downloaded from WinCustomize.com\n\n Fonts\n Easily change which fonts your skins use.\n\n Colors\n Find a great skin, but want to change the color scheme? WindowBlinds enables instant color changes from its configuration menu.\n\n Textures\n Personalize any skin by applying one of the textures included with WindowBlinds or use one of your own creations.\n\n Explorer Backgrounds\n Tired of looking at those boring white explorer windows? Customize them with unique explorer backgrounds.\n\n Easy set-up\n We have simplified the configuration menu to make personalizing your desktop quick and intuitive. Instantly preview your selections and adjustments before you apply them to your desktop.\n\n Presets\n Any changes and adjustments you make to a skin can be saved as a preset. Presets enable you to access previous customizations and apply them to a skin quickly.\n\n Randomized Skins\n WindowBlinds enables you to change skins randomly at timed intervals. Your desktop will never be boring again when you are treated to a new skin every time you logon.\n\n Per application skinning\n Choose skins for each of your application types. For example, WindowBlinds enables your word processing software to use a different skin than your design programs.\n\n Design your own skins\n Each purchase includes SkinStudio, the powerful companion application for WindowBlinds that enables you to create your own skins. Edit controls, start menu, taskbars, explorer windows, fonts, colors backgrounds and more with SkinStudio.\n\n Easy to use\n Customize only the parts of the Windows interface you want to change and SkinStudio will do the rest. This makes it easy for inexperienced users to create a great skin quickly. Advanced users can still enjoy designing every aspect of the Windows interface.\n\n \n\nPlatform : Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1\nLanguage : English\n \n \n================\n [CHANGELOG:]\n================\n\nWhat's new in v8.04:\n\n -Fixes for right mouse button menus on Windows 8.1 Update and a resource leak\n\n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES:]\n================\n\n\n 1.
