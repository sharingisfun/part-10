The knowledge gained from this education that was\nfurther influenced by her Christian upbringing, formal food-service\ntraining, and interest in herbalism makes Alma's understanding of\nfoods and herbs unique and this book uniquely important.\nCrow ethnobotany has not been widely shared and is not widely\nknown. Although scattered references to the edible and medicinal\nuses of plants by the Crow exist, the first published work on uses\nof Crow plants was J. W. Blankinship's 1905 Native Economic Plants of\nMontana, which lists Crow uses for thirteen plants.1 A more insightful\nwork was written by a Crow woman, Joy Yellowtail Toineeta, whose\n1970 masterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thesis, titled Absarog-Issawua (From the Land of the Crow\nIndians), is the most detailed ethnobotany of the Crow and discusses\nsixty-four species of plants.2 Unfortunately, this work has never\ncirculated beyond the few of us who have borrowed it from the\nMontana State University library.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd56e4e9085c73f0cf813c76e3425b9c199ee409","amp;dn":"Taste+of+Heritage-Crow+Indian+Recipes-+Medicine%282006%29pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd56e4e9085c73f0cf813c76e3425b9c199ee409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,86,228,233,8,92,115,240,207,129,60,118,227,66,91,156,25,158,228,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
