This time it&amp;#039;s 9 albums by the post-punk and electronic/techno project Clock DVA. Though not playing industrial themselves they were closely connected to the industrial scene, being friends with Throbbing Gristle and getting some of their albums released on Industrial Records.\nThis Sheffield based band began in 1979/80 as an post-punk project, releasing 8 lp&amp;#039;s and ep&amp;#039;s 1980-85, and being part of the wave of Sheffield bands which made the city famous as a musicians city.\nThen, they got silent for a few years, until they returned in 1988 with their new sound, inspired by Kraftwerk&amp;#039;s man-machine concept, cyberpunk literature and the growing hacker culture (their music video, The Hacker, was dedicated to the hacker Karl Koch (a.k.a Hagbard Celine).\n\nThis is not an complete discography (for an almost complete list of their releases, check http://www.discogs.com/artist/Clock+DVA ), only the albums I&amp;#039;ve been able to get my hands on in various ways.\nThis collection contains 9 albums, including 3 of their early post-punk albums (White Souls In Black Suits, Thirst and Advantage, the latter in two versions, the first an 128kbps complete version of the 1989 CD release, the other an higher bitrate, but incomplete version) and 6 albums, singles and ep&amp;#039;s of their later electronic/techno works.\n\nList:\n\nWhite souls in black suits (1980, 1990 CD release)\nThirst (1981, LP)\nAdvantage (1983, 1989 CD release in 128kbps, and incomplete higher quality version)\nThe Hacker (1988, 7&amp;#039;&amp;#039;)\nSound Mirror (1990, CDs)\nBitstream (1992, CDs)\nMan-Amplified (1992, CD)\nSign (1993, CD)\nBuried Dreams (1998, CD)\n\n-------\n\nIf you have any of their other albums, which I&amp;#039;m missing, and is willing to upload them, please post a comment with the link to where it can be found.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c7a0a5cc8893d427c0f6f37f3efa80701ea1af2","amp;dn":"Clock+DVA+%289+albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c7a0a5cc8893d427c0f6f37f3efa80701ea1af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,122,10,92,200,137,61,66,124,15,111,55,243,239,168,7,1,234,26,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
