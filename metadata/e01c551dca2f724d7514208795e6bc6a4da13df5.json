This is the unRARed version of all seven episodes. All episodes are of good quality and there are no sync issues. (I think episode 2 or 3 was repacked. I have included the good version in this pack).\n\n---------------------------------\n\nSynopsis:\n\nI Survived A Japanese Game Show has begun shooting in Japan and will premiere TUESDAY, JUNE 24, 2008 (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET) on ABC. This unscripted reality/game show takes an eye-opening, behind-the-scenes look at 10 Americans - many of whom have never traveled outside the United States -- who are whisked away to Japan and compete in the ultimate Japanese game show...with hilarious results. The final winner will take home $250,000.\n\nGuiding the American players through their stay in Japan will be Host/Interpreter Tony Sano (Spring Break in Japan, Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight), an American actor who is fluent in Japanese; a house mother and resident pot stirrer, Mamasan; and the witty Game Show Host Rome Kanda (Pink Panther, Saturday Night Live), who leads the contestants through all of the zany challenges.\n\nThe executive producers are Arthur Smith and Kent Weed (A. Smith &amp; Co., Kitchen Nightmares, Hell&amp;#039;s Kitchen), David Sidebotham, Karsten Bartholin and Tim Crescenti, from a concept by Babyfoot APS Denmark.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e01c551dca2f724d7514208795e6bc6a4da13df5","amp;dn":"I.Survived.A.Japanese.Game.Show.S01+%28All+Season+01+Episodes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e01c551dca2f724d7514208795e6bc6a4da13df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,28,85,29,202,47,114,77,117,20,32,135,149,230,188,106,77,161,61,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
