Field Marshal Erich von Manstein described his book as a personal narrative of a soldier, discussing only those matters that had direct bearing on events in the military field. The essential thing, as he wrote, is to &quot;know how the main personalities thought and reacted to events.&quot; This is what he tells us in this book.His account is detailed, yet dispassionate and objective. &quot;Nothing is certain in war, when all is said and done,&quot; But in Manstein's record, at least, we can see clearly what forces were in action. In retrospect, perhaps his book takes on an even greater significance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e79a5491a4e5e527c936f7351c08d497f9dac04","amp;dn":"Lost+Victories+-+Erich+von+Manstein.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e79a5491a4e5e527c936f7351c08d497f9dac04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,121,165,73,26,78,94,82,124,147,111,115,81,192,141,73,127,157,172,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
