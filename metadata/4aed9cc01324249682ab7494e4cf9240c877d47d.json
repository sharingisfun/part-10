It focuses on conjectures about the intelligence explosion, transhumanism, and whole brain emulation. Recent years have seen a plethora of forecasts about the profound, disruptive impact that is likely to result from further progress in these areas. Many commentators however doubt the scientific rigor of these forecasts, rejecting them as speculative and unfounded. We therefore invited prominent computer scientists, physicists, philosophers, biologists, economists and other thinkers to assess the singularity hypotheses. Their contributions go beyond speculation, providing deep insights into the main issues and a balanced picture of the debate.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: The Frontiers Collection\nPDF: 441 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2012 edition (April 13, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3642325599\nISBN-13: 978-3642325595\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aed9cc01324249682ab7494e4cf9240c877d47d","amp;dn":"Singularity+Hypotheses%3A+A+Scientific+and+Philosophical+Assessmen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aed9cc01324249682ab7494e4cf9240c877d47d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,237,156,192,19,36,36,150,130,171,116,148,228,207,146,64,200,119,212,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
