News producer Melissa McGuire and Fire Captain Harry Brody\ncouldn't be more different, though they do have one thing in common: they're\nboth convinced they're perfectly wrong for each other. But when Melissa's\nmatchmaking grandmother wins her a date with Brody at a Bachelor auction . . .\n\nSparks fly. Passion flares. Heat rises. (You get the picture.) Add a curse, a\nconniving nightly news anchor, a stunningly handsome daredevil fireman, a brave\nlittle boy, a couple of exes, and one giant fire to the mix, and Melissa and\nBrody's love may not be the only thing that burns.\n\n\n\nThe Fireman Who Loved Me\n(The Bachelor Firemen of San Gabriel #1)\nby Jennifer Bernard\nISBN: 0062088963\n(ISBN13: 9780062088963)\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 532","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fef52def8f0d10e9ec4bfe827efa92e047c3496","amp;dn":"The+Fireman+Who+Loved+Me+%28The+Bachelor+Firemen+of+San+Gabriel+%231","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fef52def8f0d10e9ec4bfe827efa92e047c3496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,239,82,222,248,240,209,14,158,196,191,232,39,239,169,46,4,124,52,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
