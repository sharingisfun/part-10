Watch as one chef attempts lasagna &quot;grate&quot;-ness as they make an opponent grate a three pound block of Parmesan cheese! Then, there's a noticeable chill in the area when one chef denies his opponent the ability to taste their chili. Finally, one chef fights until he's blue in the face when he's forced to make his chicken cordon bleu ... blue.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 27-Oct-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbaa8c3d869da662deb58df37b042e83dccf292e","amp;dn":"Cutthroat.Kitchen.S01E12.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbaa8c3d869da662deb58df37b042e83dccf292e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,170,140,61,134,157,166,98,222,181,141,243,123,4,46,131,220,207,41,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
