His 1972 album Catch Bull at Four sold half a million copies in the first two weeks of release alone and was Billboard's number-one LP for three consecutive weeks. He has also earned two ASCAP songwriting awards in consecutive years for &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot;, which has been a hit single for four different artists.\n\nStevens converted to Islam in December 1977 and adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all his guitars for charity and left his music career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He has been given several awards for his work in promoting peace in the world, including the 2003 World Award, the 2004 Man for Peace Award, and the 2007 Mediterranean Prize for Peace. In 2006, he returned to pop music with his first album of new pop songs in 28 years, entitled An Other Cup. He now goes professionally by the single name Yusuf. His most recent album, Roadsinger, was released on 5 May 2009.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNumbers is concept album by singer/songwriter Cat Stevens released in November 1975. Subtitled &quot;A Pythagorean Theory Tale&quot;, it is a concept album based on a fictional planet in a far-off galaxy named Polygor and the &quot;Polygons&quot; who inhabit its palace. The album includes a booklet with excerpts from the planned book of the same name, written by Chris Bryant and Allan Scott, and contains pen-and-ink illustrations by Stevens.\n\nThe idea shaped into a fantastic, spiritual musical set on the planet Polygor. In the story, there is a castle with a number machine. This machine exists to fulfill the sole purpose of the planet: to disperse numbers to the rest of the universeÃ¢â‚¬â€1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (but notably, not 0). The nine inhabitants of Polygor, called &quot;Polygons&quot;, are Monad, Dupey, Trezlar, Cubis, Qizlo, Hexidor, Septo, Octav, and Novim. As the last lines of the book say, they &quot;followed a life of routine that had existed for as long as any could remember. ... It was, therefore, all the more shocking when on an ordinary day things first started to go wrong.&quot; The change takes the form of Jzero, who comes from nowhere as a slave and eventually confuses everybody with his simple truth.\n\nThe album was released along with the albums Izitso and Back to Earth in a box set called Three from the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab label. It is now out of print.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46dae67b957f64a5d70fdf65d3829fe791a331f8","amp;dn":"Cat+Stevens+-+Numbers...+%5B1975%5D%5B2001%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46dae67b957f64a5d70fdf65d3829fe791a331f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,218,230,123,149,127,100,165,215,15,223,101,211,130,159,231,145,163,49,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
