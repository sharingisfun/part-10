She believes she can help him recapture his bliss and secretly heads to the one place she knows the spirit of Christmas must still exist: New York City, where she first fell in love with Nick.\n\nIn a crowded New York diner, Rebecca befriends Joe (Greg Bryk), a caring cop who is worried about this kindly grandmother, who's alone and low on funds. Joe reveals he and his wife Lucy (Tricia Helfer) are in the middle of a divorce. Sensing that Joe is still very much in love with his wife, Rebecca agrees to work temporarily as the family's nanny until Christmas. To RebeccaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delight, by healing Joe and Lucy's family, she shows Santa that Christmas miracles are still possible and his jobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more important than ever!\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 06-Nov-2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4135fdb429ed69c3548aa66dea83e2e0b2c26ffa","amp;dn":"Mistletoe.Over.Manhattan.2011.Hallmark.DSR.x264-W4F.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4135fdb429ed69c3548aa66dea83e2e0b2c26ffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,53,253,180,41,237,105,195,84,138,166,109,234,131,226,224,178,194,111,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
