Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to Ratt, are laced with fast, technical guitar work. In 1994, bandleader, primary songwriter and producer Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Scott retained the use of the name &quot;Whitecross&quot; while Rex went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett. At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change, until Rex and Scott rejoined in 2000.\n\nIn Him,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68e06210ff7bf40f7c3d22dd7178659468a73119","amp;dn":"Whitecross+Discography+1987-2009+%2818+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68e06210ff7bf40f7c3d22dd7178659468a73119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,224,98,16,255,123,244,15,124,61,34,221,113,120,101,148,104,167,49,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
