The rotor\nrepairer must understand these principles in order to\nmaintain aircraft safely and to make repairs that are\nstructurally sound and aerodynamically smooth.\n\nAERODYNAMICS\nAerodynamics deals with the motion of air and with\nthe forces acting on objects moving through air or\nremaining stationary in a current of air. The same\nprinciples of aerodynamics apply to both rotary-wing\nand fixed-wing aircraft. Four forces that affect an\naircraft at all times are weight, lift, thrust, and drag:\n\nWeight is the force exerted on an aircraft by\ngravity. The pull of gravity acts through the\naircraftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s center of gravity, which is the point\nat which an aircraft would balance if\nsuspended. The magnitude of this force\nchanges only with a change in aircraft weight.\n\nLift is produced by air passing over the wing\nof an airplane or over the rotor blades of a\nhelicopter. Lift is the force that overcomes\nthe weight of an aircraft so that it can rise in\nthe air.\n\nThrust is the force that moves an aircraft\nthrough the air. In a conventional fixed-wing\naircraft, thrust provided by the propeller\nmoves the plane forward while the wings\nsupply the lift. In a helicopter both thrust and\nlift are supplied by the main rotor blades.\n\nDrag is the force of resistance by the air to the\npassage of an aircraft through it. Thrust force\nsets an aircraft in motion and keeps it in motion\nagainst drag force.\n\nAny device designed to produce lift or thrust when\npassed through air is an airfoil. Airplane wings,\npropeller blades, and helicopter main and tail rotor\nblades are all airfoils","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cf33a08d663a8ebab6d7428efba874d0316d860","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+rotor+and+power+train+maintenance+techniques+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cf33a08d663a8ebab6d7428efba874d0316d860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,243,58,8,214,99,168,235,171,109,116,40,239,186,135,77,3,22,216,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
