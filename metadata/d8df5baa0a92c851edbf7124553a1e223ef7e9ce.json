The script was inspired by the stories of Polish soldiers who during World War II underwent training in the UK in order to return to German-occupied Poland and partake in the underground struggle for independence.\r\nThe series also touches upon the challenges faced by the German military intelligence organisation Abwehr, the intelligence agency of the SS Sicherheitsdienst des ReichsfÃ¼hrers-SS (SD), the Nazi secret police commonly known as the Gestapo and the infiltration of the Union of Armed Struggle/Armia Krajowa by the Abwehr and the SD. The series also briefly covers the activities of the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and the NKVD.\r\n\r\nUntil 2013 six series of 13 episodes each were made. Seasons: I, II and III take place in the spring, summer and autumn of 1941. Season IV covers the period from April to June 1944. The action takes place mainly in Warsaw, including the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto, however some parts of the series are set in other areas of the General Government, as well as England, Italy and the Third Reich. Season V tells the story of the final period of World War II and shortly after its end, from April to June 1945, and is set in the newly instated People's Republic of Poland, Czechoslovakia and the American zone of the Allied-occupied West Germany.\r\nThe action of seasons from I to VI unfolds in the chronological order.
