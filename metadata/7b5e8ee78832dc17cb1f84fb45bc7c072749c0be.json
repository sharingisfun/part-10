To anyone unfamiliar with him, I strongly recommend watching Wise's lecture on &quot;The Pathology of Privilege,&quot; available on youtube and other places.\n\n\n\nWhite Like Me: Reflections on Race From a Privileged Son (Soft Skull Press, 2008, 2011)\n\nWith a new preface and updated chapters, White Like Me is one-part memoir, one-part polemical essay collection. It is a personal examination of the way in which racial privilege shapes the daily lives of white Americans in every realm: employment, education, housing, criminal justice, and elsewhere.\n\nUsing stories from his own life, Tim Wise demonstrates the ways in which racism not only burdens people of color, but also benefits, in relative terms, those who are &quot;white like him.&quot; He discusses how racial privilege can harm whites in the long run and make progressive social change less likely. He explores the ways in which whites can challenge their unjust privileges, and explains in clear and convincing language why it is in the best interest of whites themselves to do so. Using anecdotes instead of stale statistics, Wise weaves a narrative that is at once readable and yet scholarly, analytical and yet accessible.\n\n\n\nDear White America: Letter to a New Minority (City Lights, 2012)\n\nWhite Americans have long been comfortable in the assumption that they are the cultural norm. Now that notion is being challenged, as white people wrestle with what it means to be part of a fast-changing, truly multicultural nation. Facing chronic economic insecurity, a popular culture that reflects the nation's diverse cultural reality, a future in which they will no longer constitute the majority of the population, and with a black president in the White House, whites are growing anxious.\n\nThis anxiety has helped to create the Tea Party movement, with its call to &quot;take our country back.&quot; By means of a racialized nostalgia for a mythological past, the Right is enlisting fearful whites into its campaign for reactionary social and economic policies.\n\nIn urgent response, Tim Wise has penned his most pointed and provocative work to date. Employing the form of direct personal address, he points a finger at whitesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ race-based self-delusion, explaining how such an agenda will only do harm to the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people, including most whites. In no uncertain terms, he argues that the hope for survival of American democracy lies in the embrace of our multicultural past, present and future.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nTim Wise is among the most prominent anti-racist writers and activists in the U.S., and has been called the &quot;foremost white anti-racist intellectual in the nation,&quot; having spoken in 46 states, and on over 300 college campuses, including Harvard, Stanford, Cal Tech and the Law Schools at Yale, Columbia, Michigan, and Vanderbilt. From 1999 to 2003, Wise served as an advisor to the Fisk University Race Relations Institute. His anti-racism efforts have been termed &quot;revolutionary&quot; by NYU professor and award-winning author, Robin D.G. Kelley, and have also earned praise from such noted race scholars as Michael Eric Dyson, Kimberly Crenshaw, Derrick Bell, Joe Feagin, Lani Guinier, and Richard Delgado.Tim Wise is now the Director of the newly-formed Association for White Anti-Racist Education (AWARE) in Nashville, Tennessee. He lectures across the country about the need to combat institutional racism, gender bias, and the growing gap between rich and poor in the U.S. He is a featured columnist with the ZNet Commentary program; a web service that disseminates essays by prominent progressive and radical activists and educators. His writings are taught at hundreds of colleges and have appeared in dozens of popular and professional journals. He has contributed to three recent anthologies - When Race Becomes Real; Black and White Writers Confront Their Personal Histories (Chicago Review Press, Jan 2004); Should America Pay (HarperAmistad, 2003), a compilation of essays concerning slavery and its aftermath; and The Power of Non-Violence (Beacon Press, 2002).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b5e8ee78832dc17cb1f84fb45bc7c072749c0be","amp;dn":"Tim+Wise+-+White+Like+Me+and+Dear+White+America+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b5e8ee78832dc17cb1f84fb45bc7c072749c0be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,94,142,231,136,50,220,23,203,31,132,251,69,188,124,7,39,73,192,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
