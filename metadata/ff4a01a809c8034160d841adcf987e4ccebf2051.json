However, newly arrived Superintendent BRIGHT has other ideas, and when a respectable GP is found shot dead in a public lavatory, ENDEAVOURÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outlandish theories soon see him relegated to General Duties. \nHumiliated and humbled, Endeavour has to investigate from the sidelines. Through a puzzling haze of deceit and misdirection, involving an Oxford physicist who worked on the atomic bomb, and the fate of a vulnerable single mother, Endeavour is forced to question ThursdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orders and risk his career to avert a family tragedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff4a01a809c8034160d841adcf987e4ccebf2051","amp;dn":"Endeavour.S01E01.Girl.Xvid-AJAXEN.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff4a01a809c8034160d841adcf987e4ccebf2051","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,74,1,168,9,200,3,65,96,216,65,173,207,152,126,76,206,191,32,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
