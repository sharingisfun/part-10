In the food-zealous, insular megalopolis of Tokyo, Ivan opened a ramen shop. He was a gaijin (foreigner), trying to make his name in a place that is fiercely opinionated about ramen. At first, customers came because they were curious, but word spread quickly about IvanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s handmade noodles, clean and complex broth, and thoughtfully prepared toppings. Soon enough, Ivan became a celebrityÃ¢â‚¬â€a fixture of Japanese TV programs and the face of his own best-selling brand of instant ramen. Ivan opened a second location in Tokyo, and has now returned to New York City to open his first US branch.\n\n Ivan Ramen is essentially two books in one: a memoir and a cookbook. In these pages, Ivan tells the story of his ascent from wayward youth to a star of the Tokyo restaurant scene. He also shares more than forty recipes, including the complete, detailed recipe for his signature Shio Ramen; creative ways to use extra ramen components; and some of his most popular ramen variations. Written with equal parts candor, humor, gratitude, and irreverence, Ivan Ramen is the only English-language book that offers a look inside the cultish world of ramen making in Japan. It will inspire you to forge your own path, give you insight into Japanese culture, and leave you with a deep appreciation for what goes into a seemingly simple bowl of noodles.\n\n2013\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad0a97b9222bd8a5e89623a47addfed08ec1dd6","amp;dn":"Ivan+Ramen%3A+Recipes+from+Tokyo%27s+Most+Unlikely+Noodle+Joint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad0a97b9222bd8a5e89623a47addfed08ec1dd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,208,169,123,146,34,189,138,94,137,98,58,71,173,223,237,8,236,29,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
