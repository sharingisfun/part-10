The band's first album, Kingdom of Madness, came out in 1978, right in the midst of the punk rock musical revolution. That timing may be one factor contributing to the band's unknown status. 1979 saw the release of Magnum II. After extensive gigging, the group released Marauder, a live album in 1980, and Chase the Dragon came two years later. Going back to their &quot;album-a-year&quot; pace, The Eleventh Hour was released in 1983. The band went two years between discs again, with On a Storyteller's Night not being released until 1985, but the time seemed to have done some good for them. The album was well-received and their fame was growing in Europe. Their next disc was produced by Roger Taylor (Queen) and Vigilante (1986) continued the group's rise. The true fruition came with Wings of Heaven the following year, as it made several charts in England. 1990 saw the next studio release, Goodnight L.A., and an album of rarities, entitled Spirit: A History, came the next year. By 1992, the band had recorded their next release, Sleepwalking. They decided to call it quits in 1994, releasing Rock Art and commencing on a farewell tour. The tour was documented with the live album The Last Dance (1996). Little did they know at the time that the breakup was not a permanent one and the band re-assembled in 2001 to record a new album, Breath of Life, released in 2002. The disc reunited original members Bob Catley and Tony Clarkin with '80s keyboardist Mark Stanway. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tSteamhammer\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Black Skies\n02.Doors To Nowhere\n03.The Visitation\n04.Wild Angels\n05.Spin Like A Wheel\n06.The Last Frontier\n07.Freedom Day\n08.Mother Nature's Final Dance\n09.Midnight Kings\n10.Tonight's The Night\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e8962755c8ca34f3c999b3b55168a5ced56608","amp;dn":"Magnum+-+The+Visitation+%282011%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86e8962755c8ca34f3c999b3b55168a5ced56608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,232,150,39,85,200,202,52,243,201,153,179,181,81,104,165,206,213,102,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
