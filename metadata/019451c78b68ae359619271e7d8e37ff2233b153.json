The brothers enlisted drummer John Kirtland and guitarist Clay Bergus. Deep Blue Something originally performed as Leper Messiah, after the line from Ziggy Stardust.[1]\n\nBergus left the band before the band started recording their first album, 11th Song. The band independently released the album in 1993. Kirk Tatom joined the band after the album's release. In 1994, the band released their second album, Home via an independent label named Rainmaker Records. Home was re-released a year later by major label Interscope Records. The accompanying single &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; reached the top five in the United States and number one in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Todd Pipes, the lyrics of the song were inspired by Audrey Hepburn's performance in the feature film Roman Holiday, but he thought that the Hepburn film Breakfast at Tiffany's would make a better song title.[2]\n\nIn late-1995, Tatom left the band and Bergus returned to his role as guitarist. The band worked on their sophomore album titled Byzantium with a planned release in 1996. However, the Deep Blue Something came into legal troubles over the copyright of 11th song and &quot;Breakfast At Tiffany's&quot;.[3] As a result, Interscope put the album on hold. In 1998, the album was released only in Japan and some European countries. The album was currently available in the US.\n\nIn the wake of the Universal/PolyGram merger, the band parted ways with Interscope. They later signed with Azera Records, an independent label based in Phoenix, Arizona. Their self-titled album, which contains five tracks from Byzantium, was released later that year. Shortly after the album's relese, the band went separate ways. \n\n\nHome 1995\n\n\nHome is the second album by alternative rock band Deep Blue Something. It was originally released by Rainmaker Records in 1994 and rereleased on Interscope in 1995.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Gammer Gerten's Needle&quot; [Instrumental] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\n2.\t&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:16\n3.\t&quot;Halo&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:44\n4.\t&quot;Josey&quot; (Toby Pipes/Kirk Tatom) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n5.\t&quot;A Water Prayer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n6.\t&quot;Done&quot; (Todd Pipes/Toby Pipes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n7.\t&quot;Song to Make Love to&quot; (Todd Pipes/Toby Pipes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:08\n8.\t&quot;The Kandinsky Prince&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:25\n9.\t&quot;Home&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n10.\t&quot;Red Light&quot; (Toby Pipes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n11.\t&quot;I Can Wait&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:04\n12.\t&quot;Wouldn't Change A Thing &quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:019451c78b68ae359619271e7d8e37ff2233b153","amp;dn":"Deep+Blue+Something+-+Home+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"019451c78b68ae359619271e7d8e37ff2233b153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,148,81,199,139,104,174,53,150,25,39,30,125,142,55,255,34,51,177,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
