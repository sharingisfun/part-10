It presents the consideration of the physics, chemistry, thermodynamics and kinetics of processes of energy conversion, which occur at hydrogen production, storage, transportation and with its use. It also discusses the pioneering attempts to transform motor transport, airplanes, domestic technics, illumination and industrial manufacture of hydrogen fuel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de124d5812ecb470d66662205fc6f0b5caced94d","amp;dn":"Hydrogen+Materials+Science+and+Chemistry+of+Carbon+Nanomaterials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de124d5812ecb470d66662205fc6f0b5caced94d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,18,77,88,18,236,180,112,214,102,98,32,95,198,240,181,202,206,217,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
