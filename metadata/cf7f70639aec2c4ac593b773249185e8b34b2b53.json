The album was released on December 7, 2006 in the United States, on Re-Up, Star Trak and Jive. Recording sessions for the album took place over a period of several years, and suffered numerous delays prior to release. Production was handled by The Neptunes.\n\nFollowing the release of their debut studio album, Lord Willin', brothers Gene and Terrence Thornton began working on the album in late 2003, but were forced to delay development when several artists signed to Arista Records were dissolved into sister label Jive, as part of a larger merger between Sony Music Entertainment and BMG. This resulted in Star Trak moving to Interscope Records, signing a new distribution deal. Due to contractual requirements, Clipse were forced to remain with Jive. Upon completion of the album, the duo became increasingly frustrated with the label, as Jive was in favor of more pop-orientated acts. Clipse eventually requested a formal release from their contract with the label, which was denied. Clipse then sued Jive, eventually reaching a settlement on May 9, 2006.\n\nHell Hath No Fury landed at #14 on the Billboard 200 with 78,000 copies sold in the first week.[2] Two singles were released prior to the album, &quot;Mr. Me Too&quot; and &quot;Wamp Wamp (What It Do)&quot;, both of which attained moderate chart success.\n\nUpon its release, Hell Hath No Fury received universal acclaim from music critics, earning praise for its exotic production and lyrical inventiveness.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nAll tracks produced by The Neptunes.\n\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;We Got It for Cheap&quot; (Intro)\t3:41\n2.\t&quot;Momma I'm So Sorry&quot;  \t3:57\n3.\t&quot;Mr. Me Too&quot; (featuring Pharrell)\t3:41\n4.\t&quot;Wamp Wamp (What It Do)&quot; (featuring Slim Thug)\t4:00\n5.\t&quot;Ride Around Shining&quot; (featuring Ab-Liva)\t3:56\n6.\t&quot;Dirty Money&quot;  \t3:46\n7.\t&quot;Hello New World&quot; (featuring Pharrell)\t4:12\n8.\t&quot;Keys Open Doors&quot;  \t3:19\n9.\t&quot;Ain't Cha&quot; (featuring Re-Up Gang)\t4:42\n10.\t&quot;Trill&quot; (featuring Pharrell)\t4:43\n11.\t&quot;Chinese New Year&quot; (featuring Rosco P.
