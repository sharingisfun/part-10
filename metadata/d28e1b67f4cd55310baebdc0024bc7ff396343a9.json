It was recorded in January 1997 at Abyss Studios in Sweden. The album was a huge success for the band and was their first release on Nuclear Blast Records, as well as their first full-length to contain lyrics in English. It has been put out in many formats including a limited edition vinyl (300 white &amp; 1000 black) and in 2002 a deluxe cd version was released with bonus material. It was also the group&amp;#039;s first album to display the newer logo (the old &quot;black metal&quot;-styled logo is still seen on the back cover artwork of the original pressing). Due to the success the album has seen, many felt the band &quot;sold out&quot; by signing to Nuclear Blast and for dramatically changing their style, while others praised the differing approach Dimmu would undertake, having the guitar riffs inspired by classic metal bands and having heavier symphonic elements and an over-all darker feel. This is the album to start the band&amp;#039;s trend of titling their albums with three words.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MagikBullet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MagikBullet/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d28e1b67f4cd55310baebdc0024bc7ff396343a9","amp;dn":"Dimmu.Borgir-Enthrone.Darkness.Triumphant%5B1997%5D%5BMP3%5D%5B320Kbps%5D-Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d28e1b67f4cd55310baebdc0024bc7ff396343a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,142,27,103,244,205,85,49,11,174,189,192,2,75,199,255,57,99,67,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
