And use less electricity too!\nDiskeeper also includes powerful defrag engines for what isn't prevented \nand runs in real-time, with zero resource conflicts. \n\nHow??? All computers suffer from fragmentation - where files are broken up and \nscattered all across your disk drives. This makes it take longer to read, write \nand save files. Plus since your PC is working harder than it needs to, more wear \nand tear occurs. Diskeeper with new IntelliWrite fragmentation prevention resolves \nthis by preventing up to 85% of all fragmentation from happening in the first \nplace. Any remaining fragmentation is quickly eliminated in real time thanks to \nDiskeeperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s InvisiTasking technology. \n\nWith new Diskeeper 2011 your computers simply run better than new all the time! \nYour computers will run faster with Diskeeper 2011 installed. You'll enjoy using \nevery aspect of your systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from downloading to accessing files to surfing the \nweb with greater ease and efficiency. Leave hang-times, freeze-ups and other \nfragmentation-based crashes in the dust.\n\nFile fragmentation on your computer's hard drive is one of the most basic reasons \nfor slows, hangs, crashes and system errors. Left alone, it will bring your \ncomputer to a halt. Fragmentation is continual and with the number of today's \napplications, peripherals, and file sizes, it accumulates hourly. \nNo manual defragmenter will prevent this. Diskeeper 2011 is the only defragmenter \never built that defragments in real time without requiring a schedule. \nYour computer will run faster with Diskeeper 2011 installed - period.\n\nAvailable in Diskeeper 2011, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment \ndefragmentation without tapping into active system resources. \nThe result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts \nin real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance. InvisiTasking \ntechnology offers true transparent, background processing technology allows \nDiskeeper 2011 to defragment your computer in real-time, completely eliminating \nthe need for cumbersome maintenance operations. Free up gridlocked resources and \nlet your computer hum along at peak performance. Diskeeper 2011 Professional \nenhances the reliability and performance of your computer-automatically! \n\nDiskeeper 2011 I-FAAST file optimization technology accelerates file access times \nto meet the heavy workloads of file-intensive applications. \nUtilizing a specially formulated technology, I-FAAST closely monitors file usage\nand organizes the most commonly accessed files for the fastest possible access, \nboosting file access and creation to speeds above and beyond the capabilities of \nyour system when it was new, up to 80% faster.  \n\nHigh-power computer systems require high power-defragmentation engines. \nOnly Diskeeper 2011 includes the advanced technology necessary to eliminate \nlarge volume fragmentation found on big and busy computers. \n\nThe remarkable Terabyte Volume Engine (TVE) technology. TVE is the only defrag \ntechnology with the necessary horsepower to eliminate the rapid fragmentation \nbuild-up that occurs in high-traffic volumes that handles millions of files. \nTVE was initially developed for the highest capacity servers but has now also \nbecome essential for the high end power user. Large databases, CAD programs -\nDiskeeper 2011 handles the biggest jobs fast and thoroughly. The greater the \nnumber of files and fragments on a volume, the more dramatic TVE's benefits \nwill be. Nothing compares to TVE's ability to eliminate enterprise level \nfragmentation. In a class of its own, TVE makes real-time power computer \ndefragmentation a fact.\n\n\nChanges in Diskeeper 2011:\n**************************\n- Efficiency. New technology and advanced algorithms maximize performance \n  while eliminating disk I/O activity not conducive to improving your computing \n  experience. Maximum performance from minimal effort!\n- Immediacy. With IntelliWrite continuing to prevent most fragmentation before \n  it happens, the new Instant Defrag feature of Diskeeper now rapidly eliminates \n  any fragmented data that does occur.\n- Scalability. With the immediate file-by-file approach to optimization, time \n  and resource consuming whole-volume analysis and defragmentation operations \n  are rarely, if ever, needed. This revolutionary new design scales to much \n  larger volumes than traditional disk defragmentation technologies!\n- Defragmentation Options. Diskeeper now defaults to an &quot;Efficient&quot; \n  defragmentation method to maximize efficiency and performance while\n  minimizing disk I/O by intelligently determining which files, folders \n  and free space should be defragmented. This setting can be changed to \n  a more extensive defragmentation option from the Defragmentation Options \n  tab in the Configuration Properties.\n- Savings. Diskeeper now tracks I/OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s saved on your system. Taking into account \n  the I/O activity of Diskeeper as well, this cumulative net figure equates to \n  less system processing overhead, disk head movement, and total power consumption \n  resulting in reduced operating costs. Now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even easier to gauge the benefits \n  of your new investment !\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n********************\nHardware Support\nWindows XP Home, Windows XP Tablet PC, Windows XP Media Center, \nWindows XP Professional (x86 only), Windows Vista/7 Home Basic (x86 only), \nWindows Vista/7 Home Premium (x86/x64), Windows Vista/7 Ultimate (x86/x64), \nWindows Vista Business (x86/x64), Windows 7 Professional (x86/x64) and \nWindows Vista/7 Enterprise (x86/x64) platforms (including compatible CPUs \nfrom other manufacturers).\n\nfunctional limits: \nMaximum supported volume size: unlimited \nDisk subsystems supported: \nPrimary Partitions \nExtended Partitions \nLogical Drives \nVolume Sets \nRAID Arrays (hardware and software) \nMirrored Disks \nMounted Volumes (letter-less drives) \n\nResource Requirements\nThe disk space requirements for Diskeeper depend on several factors. \nThe Diskeeper installation package is about 60 MB. After the installation \nis complete, Diskeeper occupies about 38 MB of disk space. If Internet Explorer \nis not present on your computer, some other needed files (hhupd.exe, 50comupd.exe,\nand wintdist.exe) may be added. Further, your system may require a new or updated \nversion of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), which is less than 6 MB.\n  \n\nAdditional Software Requirements\nDiskeeper relies on the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). The MMC provides \na single point of control for system utilities such as Diskeeper. The MMC is \nused as a central location for a variety of Microsoft and third party \nadministrative tools. The MMC is included in newer Windows operating systems.\n \n\nA Note About Firewalls\nAs a normal part of its operation, the Diskeeper Service (DkService.exe) acts \nas a Windows service on your system. If you are running a hardware or software\nfirewall, you may see messages indicating Diskeeper Service is trying to act \nas a Windows service. These messages are expected; you can safely allow these \nevents. This functionality is designed to allow for support for network operations \n(e.g. Remote Control) via Diskeeper Administrator. \n\nYou may also be notified that Diskeeper is trying to access the Internet. \nIt is important to note that Diskeeper does not access the Internet (except \nwhen you specifically use the Check for Updates feature), but it does use \nWindows mechanisms that may trigger these alerts from your firewall. \nAgain, these messages are expected and you can safely allow the events. \nIf networkability or automatic update checking is not required, you can \nsafely disable this.\n\nNote:\n***** \nIf you're using a cracked version of Diskeeper then permanently \nblock internet access for Diskeeper with e.g. a firewall.\n\n\nMore info:\n********** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.diskeeper.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.diskeeper.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.diskeeper.com/Diskeeper/hom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0c96e05d9265071224e6b0c7bcd267b1fe500f8","amp;dn":"Diskeeper+2011+Pro+Premier+15.0.951+%2B+Patch+%28x32-x64%29+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0c96e05d9265071224e6b0c7bcd267b1fe500f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,201,110,5,217,38,80,113,34,78,107,12,123,205,38,123,31,229,0,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
