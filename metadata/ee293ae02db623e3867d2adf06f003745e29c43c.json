Touring constantly, Grieves stunned crowds all over the country with his distinctive voice, lyrical precision, and unparalleled style. Following Grieves' encouraging reception and a stint on the CMJ Top 20 Hip Hop charts, fans speculated on what would be next for the emergent artist.\n\n88 Keys and Counting is the response. A joint venture with friend and renowned Seattle based producer, Budo, 88 Keys is a matured record with themes that will challenge fans old and new alike. Armed with a distinct and fluid sound that will delight your ears and rouse your cerebrum, Grieves' second effort is not to be overlooked.\n\nIrreversible (2007)\n01. Fly Away 2:45\n02.
