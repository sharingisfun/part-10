This retrospective release features their limited, long-sold-out 7Ã¢â‚¬Â³ singles on disc one Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Frozen Heart EP, their debut single Living With Ghosts (the release that caught the ears of Jack White and inspired him to immediately whisk the band to Nashville to record for his Third Man Records label) and the amazing Ã¢â‚¬ËœSunshineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ single.\nCD2 is a complete bonus disc of early studio sessions from 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ08. These tracks were only ever sold at gigs or have never been released at all. Included is the sublime Ã¢â‚¬ËœGood ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ along with other early classics, all recorded before their acclaimed 2011 debut album, Through Low Light and Trees. With tracks produced by guitar whizz and frequent Brian Eno and Pulp collaborator Leo Abrahams and with guest performances from Ed Harcourt, to later recordings with instrumentalist David Coutler, Andy Newmark (Sly and the Family Stone, John Lennon), Al Mobbs (Good The Bad and The Queen, Gorillaz) and long-time Smoke Fairies collaborator Neil Walsh, these recordings document the London duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early beginnings. The collection features never-before-released tracks, along with long-sold-out material such as the Frozen Heart EP and Smoke FairiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ debut single, Living with Ghosts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the latter being the release that caught the ears of Jack White and inspired him to immediately whisk the band to Nashville to record for his Third Man Records label. Other rarities include tracks from a tour-only Vinyl and CD (also entitled Ghosts), which was available exclusively at Smoke FairiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ US tour supporting Laura Marling in 2009, and tracks from the highly sought-after Came A Winter EP , originally Ã¢â‚¬ËœreleasedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as a burnt, hand stamped CD sold at gigs.\nGhosts represents a triptych of Smoke FairiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ developing sound, from their experiences travelling in the US deep south to the northwest of Canada, conveying a pastoral nostalgia combined with apprehension over the future, to the later recordings which firmly established the signature Smoke Fairies sound of weaving guitars and interlocking vocals.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ace1be297d39ee6b887ab981f1fb34b12f5fd3b","amp;dn":"Smoke+Fairies+-+Ghosts+%282013%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ace1be297d39ee6b887ab981f1fb34b12f5fd3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,206,27,226,151,211,158,230,184,135,171,152,31,31,179,75,18,245,253,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
