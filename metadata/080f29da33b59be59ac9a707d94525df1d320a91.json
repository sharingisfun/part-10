The album is comprised of versions of songs from Seger's previous three best-sellers: 1976's Night Moves, 1978's Stranger in Town, and 1980's Against the Wind. While Seger and his Silver Bullet Band can stretch out in a concert setting, the live versions here stick pretty close to their original studio versions. The cut of &quot;Old Time Rock &amp; Roll&quot; included here proves to be even better than the original, while such Seger standards as &quot;Against the Wind,&quot; &quot;Night Moves,&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Never Forgets&quot; also prove to be highlights","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080f29da33b59be59ac9a707d94525df1d320a91","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger+%26amp%3B+The+Silver+Bullet+Band-Nine+Tonight+24bit%2F96kHz+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080f29da33b59be59ac9a707d94525df1d320a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,15,41,218,51,181,155,229,154,201,167,7,217,69,37,223,29,50,10,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
