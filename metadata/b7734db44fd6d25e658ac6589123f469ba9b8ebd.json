But she bumps into mysterious writer Jack Whitaker first. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a handsome contradiction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cool and intense, with a wild past. \nJack has enough problems already.

Yet heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawn to Skye. \nAn instant rapport soon becomes intense attraction, but Jack fears they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a future if Skye ever finds out about his past ... \nWill their memories tear them apart, or can they build new ones together?\n\n\nNote:   I bought this..\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
