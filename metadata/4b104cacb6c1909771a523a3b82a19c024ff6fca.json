In 1000 Masterpieces, she applies her unique intensity to what most inspires her in the artist's work as well as to the essential life events that shaped the work. Arranged alphabetically by artist, each work receives a full page of attention. The text contains information, annotated where necessary on materials and techniques, on the artist's symbolism, and on the location where the original work is displayed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b104cacb6c1909771a523a3b82a19c024ff6fca","amp;dn":"Sister+Wendys+1000+Masterpieces+%28Art+Ebook+Paintings%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b104cacb6c1909771a523a3b82a19c024ff6fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,16,76,172,182,193,144,151,113,165,35,163,184,42,25,192,36,255,111,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
