Much harder-hitting than their debut, These Four Walls, this album harnesses the power the band displayed before into a wall of sound that is as rousing as it is anguished, starting with Circles and Squares and only letting up for the occasional ballad. Their previous indie pop leanings are mostly gone, though Medicines driving post-punk has a tunefulness that makes it a standout. Their darkest and most complex work yet, In the Pit of the Stomach unleashes We Were Promised Jetpacks full fury with impressive results.\n\nReleased: Oct 4, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Alternative\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~1,000 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
