Here we'll learn how the blocking phase is a critical part of creating levels in Unreal. After that, we'll replace that geometry with static mesh assets that will be used for the final look of our level.\r\n\r\nBuy the course:  \nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1609-Introduction-to-Unreal-Engine-4\r\n\r\nView me on KAT: https://kat.cr/user/ghost_potato/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dc05a7a346206edb21e2df3d757944230845600","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Introduction+to+Unreal+Engine+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dc05a7a346206edb21e2df3d757944230845600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,192,90,122,52,98,6,237,178,30,45,243,215,87,148,66,48,132,86,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
