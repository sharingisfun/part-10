She started her cheese career in New York City as an apprentice in the cheese caves of Artisanal Premium Cheese, going on to manage the caves at Murray's Cheese, serve as a resident cheese expert for Marlow &amp; Sons, and consult for cheese shops across America. Sasha serves on the board of the American Cheese Society. Her interest in cheese led her to embark on a tour of 45 American cheesemakers, a project documented at cheesebyhand.com. Her first book, The Guide to West Coast Cheese: More than 300 Cheeses Handcrafted in California, Oregon, and Washington, was published in September 2010. Davies has taught classes at the French Culinary Institute and the Cheese School of San Francisco. Other food writing by Davies has appeared in Mix Magazine, the Diner Journal, and the cheese-focused magazine Culture.\nDavid Bleckmann is an obsessed home cheesemaker in Portland, Oregon. Before cheese, he worked his way through other domestic culinary crafts including making beer and wine, preserving jam, pickling, curing bacon and other meat, and roasting coffee. This interest in creating food from scratch and a fascination with food science led to an immersion in the art of turning liquid milk into solid cheese. He teaches cheesemaking classes and writes freelance articles for Culture, and also maintains a blog and hosts a hobby cheesemaking podcast at his website joyofcheesemaking.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978b555df58d54ac1949c8f52f5d649fd9dbddb8","amp;dn":"The+Cheesemaker%27s+Apprentice+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978b555df58d54ac1949c8f52f5d649fd9dbddb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,139,85,93,245,141,84,172,25,73,200,245,47,93,100,159,217,219,221,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
