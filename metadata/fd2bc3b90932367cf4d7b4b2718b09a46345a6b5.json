With deft use of examples of humor and wordplay, Steven Pinker weaves our vast knowledge of language into a compelling story: language is a human instinct, wired into our brains by evolution. The Language Instinct received the William James Book Prize from the American Psychological Association and the Public Interest Award from the Linguistics Society of America.\n\n\nRunning Time: 3:14:37","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2bc3b90932367cf4d7b4b2718b09a46345a6b5","amp;dn":"Steven+Pinker+-+The+Language+Instinct","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2bc3b90932367cf4d7b4b2718b09a46345a6b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,43,195,185,9,50,54,124,244,215,180,178,113,139,9,164,99,69,166,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
