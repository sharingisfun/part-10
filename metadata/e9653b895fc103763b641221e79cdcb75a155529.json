Scratch also packs all of the programming power and punch needed to satisfy the programming needs of most computer enthusiasts and hobbyists. Best of all, it's actually fun to use! Scratch Programming for Teens provides all the instruction that a first-time programmer needs to quickly get up and running with Scratch.
