By far their most successful album, it entered the US charts at #3 and sold over 4 million units by the end of its chart run. Its first single, &quot;One Week&quot; became the band's breakthrough single in the U.S. market by hitting #1 (selling over 5 million copies). The song also reached #5 in the UK, and helped revitalize their career in the band's home country of Canada, where their fame had diminished since the days of their debut album Gordon. In addition, follow-up singles &quot;It's All Been Done&quot;, &quot;Alcohol&quot; and &quot;Call and Answer&quot; were each successful to some degree.\n\nStunt is the first studio album to feature keyboardist/guitarist Kevin Hearn, who originally joined the band for the Born on a Pirate Ship tour in 1995. Shortly after the release of the album, Hearn was diagnosed with leukemia. He spent the Stunt tour receiving chemotherapy and was replaced by Chris Brown and Greg Kurstin in the interim.\n\nTracks recorded for Stunt that did not appear on the album were &quot;Long Way Back Home&quot; and &quot;She's On Time.&quot; These tracks appear as hidden tracks on the &quot;limited edition&quot; version of the album. &quot;Long Way Back Home&quot; was used during the closing credits for the band's Stunt tour documentary Barenaked in America. As with each of their earlier albums, the band recorded one song, &quot;Alcohol&quot;, completely naked.\n\n\n\n\nIf you like it go buy it.
