Players build space ships and space stations of various sizes and utilization (civil and military), pilot ships and perform asteroid mining.\n\nSpace Engineers utilizes a realistic volumetric-based physics engine: all objects can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game comes with two game modes: creative and survival.\n\nVolumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.\n\nSpace Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.\n\nSpace Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as a tactical shooter as well. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Space Engineers shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.\n \nEarly Access\n\nGame modes\n- Creative Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unlimited resources, instant building, no death\n- Survival Ã¢â‚¬â€œ realistic management of resources and inventory capacity; manual building; death and respawn\nSingle-player Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you are the sole space engineer\nMultiplayer - alpha version (not a final version)\n- Creative and survival mode with your friends\n- Cooperative and competitive\n- Privacy customization: offline, private, friends only, public\n- Max 16 players (this may increase in the future)\n- Weapons on/off\n- Copy-paste on/off\nScenarios\n- Easy Start 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ start on an asteroid platform with one large ship and two small ships\n- Easy Start 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ start in a green asteroid station with several large and small ships (this is a large scene!)\n- Lone Survivor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ start on an abandoned asteroid platform with no ships\n- Crashed Red Ship Ã¢â‚¬â€œ your mother ship just crashed...\n- Two Platforms Ã¢â‚¬â€œ competitive two-team multi-player world\n- Asteroids Ã¢â‚¬â€œ start in a rescue ship with very limited resources\n- Empty World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no asteroids, no ships; suitable for creative mode\nShips (small and large ships Ã¢â‚¬â€œ build them, pilot them and crush them\nSpace stations\nFirst-person &amp; Third-person\nDrilling / harvesting\nManual building in survival mode Ã¢â‚¬â€œ use welder to assemble blocks from components; use grinder to disassemble and reuse components\nDeformable and destructible objects Ã¢â‚¬â€œ real proportions, mass, storage capacity, integrity\nBuilding blocks - light armor (cube, slope, corner), heavy armor, interior wall, interior light, small cockpit, large cockpit, cargo container(s), drill, ore detector, gravity generator, nuclear reactor, thruster, gyroscope, assembler, medical room, magnetic landing gears, spotlight, catwalk, cover wall, stairs, ramp, window(s), pillar, decoy\nMagnetic landing gears Ã¢â‚¬â€œ attach your ship to a surface (another ship or asteroid)\nElectricity - all blocks in a grid are wired in an electrical and computer network; electricity is generated by nuclear reactors\nGravity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ produced by gravity generators\nRotors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ create rotating objects\nRefinery - process harvested ore to ingots\nAssembler - manufacture components from ingots\nSymmetry/Mirroring Mode - useful in creative mode when building structures that require symmetry\nWeapons - automatic rifle, small and large explosive warheads, small ship gatling gun, small ship missile launcher\nSolar panels - produce energy depending on the amount of light that they catch from the sun\nWorld management Ã¢â‚¬â€œ generate new worlds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“save asÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to multiple copies, auto-save every 5 minutes (can be turned on/off), edit world settings\n32-bit &amp; 64-bit - 64-bit version expands the amount of objects, ships and asteroids (almost unlimited)\nSteam Workshop - Share your creations with the Community (upload and download worlds)\nModding - world files, shaders, textures, 3D models\nLocalized interface (WIP) - Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Icelandic, Polish, Spanish-Spain, Spanish-Latin America, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese-Brazil, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish, Slovak, Ukrainian, Russian\nCustom colors for blocks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Customize your creations by using any color you like\nCargo ships - auto-piloted vessels (miners, freighters and military) that carry ore, ingots, constructions components and other materials from sector to sector.
