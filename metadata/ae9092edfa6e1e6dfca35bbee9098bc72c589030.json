But the tapes were among few that survived, and the younger Jaffe subsequently took it upon himself to attempt to preserve Preservation.\nMade in New Orleans is a lovingly curated document that honors the venerable institution. The boxed set, available in a few different collectorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ editions, contains a CD featuring both archival and new recordings of the group, and a DVD, as well as several reproduced artifacts: photographs, employment contracts, etc.Ã¢â‚¬â€no two of the 504 numbered sets contain the same doo-dads. The DVD features low-grade (though no less fascinating) historical footage of PHJB in action dating back to the early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s, and a music video, created in 2005 shortly before the hurricane struck, set to an old-timey cover of the KinksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Complicated Life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Not surprisingly, though, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the music on the CD that best sums up what the traditional NOLA outfit is about.\nSeveral of the tracks chosen, although recorded in part or in whole before Katrina, allude to the devastation: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blow Wind BlowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ grafts a vocal cut by Sister Gertrude Morgan in 1959 to a sparse but complementary backing track from 2005, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Over in the GlorylandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reverses the process, adding new vocals to the raucous gospel number, one of the salvaged Seasaint-recorded tracks from 1976. Most tracks, like the latter, take full advantage of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever-exhilarating battery of brass, but others, utilizing far less, are equally effective: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sugar BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ strips the sound down to a quartet of trumpet, piano, bass and drums, but its simplicity is as much the essence of New Orleans trad as any of the wailing party tunes.
