His two adult sons, Henry and Vince, are accustomed to his unsolicited and often politically incorrect rants. When Henry, a struggling writer and blogger, can no longer afford his rent, he is forced to move back in with Ed, which creates new issues in their tricky father-son relationship. As weeks go by Henry is unable to find a job as a writer, mostly due to the lack of good material. He finally lands a job, when during his interview Ed interrupts with an irrational phone call that sparks the interest of the eccentric editor conducting the interview. Henry is ultimately hired, but is forced to continue living with Ed in order to be able to continue to write about his father's unsolicited rants, hence the title &quot;$#*! My Dad Says&quot;.\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLZ HELP SEED..\n\n\n\n\n\n                    4 MORE TV SERIES N COMPLETE SEASONS\n\n                    ************************************ \n                   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/FaMoUz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/FaMoUz/&lt;/a&gt;\n                    ************************************\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aee2ea0cb30fad9f696314286c1a77a6a06bbfa6","amp;dn":"Shit+My+Dad+Says+-+The+Complete+Season+1+%5BHDTV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aee2ea0cb30fad9f696314286c1a77a6a06bbfa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,226,234,12,179,15,173,159,105,99,20,40,108,26,119,166,160,107,191,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
