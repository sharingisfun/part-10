Two years after the playwright's death in 1953, the play was given its first Broadway staging and won a Pulitzer Prize.\n \nLumet's justified reputation for expert, short-schedule transfers of plays to the screen began with Twelve Angry Men. This faithful adaptation of O'Neill's autobiographical masterwork needed someone of Lumet's clout to get the vast undertaking off the ground - and keep it afloat. His insurance was a magnificent cast, with Hepburn as the morphine-addicted mother and Richardson as the father, too mean with money and miserly of spirit to help his wife or sick son. Stockwell and Robards Jr do well as the offspring, against mega competition.\nLumet doesn't try to open up the play, and it grips - even at 174 minutes.\n\nLumet's film of O'Neill's masterpiece is one of the most faithful and well-executed screen adaptations ever due to Boris Kaufman's landmark cinematography and superlative ensemble of Ralph Richardson, Katharine Hepburn, Jason Robards and Dean Stockwell.\n\nWith its riveting performances and faultless mise-en-scÃƒÂ¨ne, this adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical play offers the most intense and harrowing of movie experiences. This is the film that earned Katharine Hepburn her reputation as a great tragedian and allowed her to tackle far more demanding dramatic roles in the autumn of her career. It is impossible to watch Hepburn in this film and not be moved to tears by the extraordinary pathos and tragic humanity that she brings to her role. Ralph Richardson is no less impressive as Hepburn's co-star, vividly conveying the torment of a man who regards his life as a failure and cannot prevent himself from blaming others, even those nearest to him, for this failure. Jason Robards and Dean Stockwell are exemplary supports to these great performers, the latter's innocence and wraith-like quality making an appropriate counterpoint to the earthiness and moral decrepitude of the other family members.\n\nAlthough it runs to just under three hours, Long Day's Journey Into Night never presents an opportunity for the spectator to get bored or distracted. Once the film has taken hold of you (which it does very quickly), you are hooked, right until the very last shot. Sidney Lumet's minimalist direction, the claustrophobic sets and the atmospheric cinematography lend an aura of confinement and sterility that perflectly encapsulates the nature of the human drama being played out. The protagonists are bound to one another in a web of mutual dependency and mutual loathing. That they love one another is never in doubt, but there is also a dark and bitter resentment in each of their hearts that frequently manifests itself in tirades and gestures of cruellest acrimony. This is the archetypal dysfunctional family, but we see far more than that. Here are the bleak and dismal failings of the human condition, exposed to us like decaying flesh rotting in the hot summer sun. As Dean Stockwell's character puts it, we are such stuff as manure is made on, although we may like to think otherwise. \n\nO'Neill's greatest play is brought to the screen with an overpowering wealth of talent: Hepburn, Richardson, and Robards give magnificent, once-in-a-lifetime performances as members of the doomed Tyrone family.\n\nBy the end of this, you're part of the family. Welcome to hell.\n\nAt Cannes 1962,Ralph Richardson, Jason Robards, Jr., Dean Stockwell collectively won Best Actor,and Katharine Hepburn won Best Actress.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.37gb\nDuration.... 02:50:43\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 848\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 1030kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 118kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f9426f8dbf89770211ca8aa4b18eee1bd9b9c8b","amp;dn":"Long+Day%27s+Journey+into+Night+1962+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f9426f8dbf89770211ca8aa4b18eee1bd9b9c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,148,38,248,219,248,151,112,33,28,168,170,75,24,238,225,189,155,156,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
