The authors influence on music and literature is almost endless, but these tracks really show the potential he had inside himself for pretty much any form of art he set his mind to. While the accompaniments are lighter in mood and therefore not quite as successful as 'Blues and Haikus', the second Kerouac album, they still serve as righteous accompaniments to the writer's succinct and intelligent poetry.\n\n\nJean-Louis &quot;Jack&quot; Kerouac; March 12, 1922 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ October 21, 1969) was a Canadian-American novelist and poet. He is considered a literary iconoclast, and alongside William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, a pioneer of the Beat Generation.Kerouac is recognized for his spontaneous method of writing covering topics such as Catholic spirituality, jazz, promiscuity, Buddhism, drugs, poverty, and travel. His writings have inspired other writers, including Ken Kesey, Bob Dylan, Richard Brautigan, Thomas Pynchon, Lester Bangs, Tom Robbins, Will Clarke, Haruki Murakami Unsympathetic critics of his work have labeled it &quot;slapdash&quot;, &quot;grossly sentimental&quot;, and &quot;immoral&quot;.[4] Kerouac became an underground celebrity and, with other beats, a progenitor of the Hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward it. In 1969, at age 47, Kerouac died from internal bleeding due to long-standing abuse of alcohol. Since his death Kerouac's literary prestige has grown and several previously unseen works have been published. All of his books are in print today, among them: On the Road, The Dharma Bums, Mexico City Blues, The Subterraneans, Desolation Angels, Visions of Cody and Big Sur.\n\nTracklist:\n1.&quot;October in the Railroad Earth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:08\n2.&quot;Deadbelly&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:02\n3.&quot;Charlie Parker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n4.&quot;The Sounds of the Universe Coming in My Window&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n5.&quot;One Mother&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:47\n6.&quot;Goofing at the Table&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:42\n7.&quot;Bowery Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n8.&quot;Abraham&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:14\n9.&quot;Dave Brubeck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:27\n10.&quot;I Had a Slouch Hat Too One Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11\n11.&quot;The Wheel of the Quivering Meat Conception&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:51\n12.&quot;McDougal Street Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n13.&quot;The Moon Her Majesty&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:36\n14.&quot;I'd Rather Be Thin Than Famous&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:37\n15.&quot;Readings from On the Road &amp; Visions of Cody&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31[/size]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a543118c7814612033fc1cb745add1f0ed0cce27","amp;dn":"Jack+Kerouac++Steve+Allen+++Poetry+For+The+Beat+Generation%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a543118c7814612033fc1cb745add1f0ed0cce27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,67,17,140,120,20,97,32,51,252,28,183,69,173,209,240,237,12,206,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
