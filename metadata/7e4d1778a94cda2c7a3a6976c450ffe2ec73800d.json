Having read the poem dozens of times, both in Old English and in translation, I have to say that this is certainly the most literal rendering of the poem in modern English that I've yet read.\n\nRebsamen states in his introduction and notes that he set out to produce a translation that would not only recreate the exciting story of the epic, but would give the reader a feel for the poetry and rhythm of the original. He has succeeded remarkably. Where most modern English editions of Beowulf are set in blank or free verse, Rebsamen follows the original four-stress pattern of Anglo-Saxon poetry and goes so far as to include the caesura or pause in the middle of each line. The language of the original also shows through very clearly. Beowulf includes scores of kennings, and Rebsamen translates many of them literally.\n\nThe translation is not without flaws, of course. Owing to the lilting, stop and start rhythms typical of Old English poetry and Rebsamen's faithful translation, the phrases sometimes seem to run over one another. The unique style also takes some time to get used to, but it's certainly worth it.\n\nRecommended.&quot;\n\n- Jordan M. Poss\n\n\n&quot;Rebsamen's Beowulf is a great translation. It's poetic and really captures the alliterative force of the Anglo-Saxon (Old English) original. Reading it aloud is pure fun and you really need to do this to experience how good Rebsamen's translation and poetry is. The 3 contemporary translations that I like most are Rebsamen's, Dick Ringler's, and Seamus Heaney's - in that order. All are fine and are qualitatively different. If you have ever tried to translate poetry from Old English or German you will understand the challenge and you'll likely agree that Rebsamen has translated in the right style and with passion.\n\nWhen read aloud, this translation mesmerizing. The language is beautiful and the rhythms haunting. There is a short but insightful introduction, a glossary of names at the back, genealogies, and recommendations for further reading and study of Anglo-Saxon language, Beowulf studies, and Anglo-Saxon history. I just love this period and its literature and Rebsamen has added to the pleasure.\n\n(For another alliterative delight, check out, &quot;The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun&quot;, by that famous Anglo-Saxonist and fantasy author, J.R.R. Tolkien) &quot;\n\n- Mark Twain\n\n\n&quot;After doing some research on different translations of Beowulf, I decided to read this one. I was not disappointed. Rebsamen attempts to translate the poem into modern language while still keeping the rules of alliterative verse from the original. He also includes descriptions of some of the background episodes so that the events in the poem have their full context. I'm by no means a Beowulf expert and cannot speak to the fidelity of the translation, but Rebsamen offers a good explanation of the original and his methods of translation at the beginning of the book, which seemed perfectly reasonable and acceptable to me, given what he was trying to accomplish. This translation brought the poem to life more than any excerpts that I had read in a classroom setting, and I felt compelled to read it aloud to get the full effect. An excellent choice if you are seeking to enjoy reading a modern translation of a classic without worrying too much about studying the original.\n\nA small warning: the image given for the book and the cover of the book I actually recieved were very different. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this. My copy was white with an image of a warrior from some Italian painting spread across the front and back of the cover. It still looked attractive and I did not mind, but I can see how some people would be bothered by this. &quot;\n\n- tegthethird\n\n\n&quot;This is my favourite translation, Heaney did a fantastic job capturing the melodic moodiness of the original text. Seldom has another translation captured me from beginning to end; this was definitely a compelling version.&quot;\n\n- LibraryThing\n\n\n---\n\nInformation:\nFormat: ePub (2.0)\nFile Size: 429 KB (original) 254 KB (this edition)\nPrint Length: 144 pages (printed edition)\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00CKOV8Z0\nISBN 978-0-06-230391-2 (ePub edition)\nISBN: 978-0-06-057378-2 (printed edition)\nISBN-10: 0-06-057378-3\n\n---\n\nComment:\nThe original of this one seems to have been converted from some kind of Adobe Program, and brought with it a lot of useless junk, double definitions/style sets etc. I did my best to get rid of all that &quot;debris&quot;, and think I succeeded pretty well. As far as I can tell, [DerHammer] have yet again turned lead into gold. ;)\nI lowered the size of this one quite a bit. Improved/decreased file size of the cover, and clearing out all sorts of huge DRM/style sheets which are of no use to you readers.\nAbout this release:\nFrederick Rebsamen's translation of Beowulf is usually counted among the best, along with Seamus Heaney's Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which I have also made available to you. It has however never gained the attention and positive feedback that Heaney's translation have. I feel it's important to make available at least the most highly rated translations of this epic work.\n\nShare and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4d1778a94cda2c7a3a6976c450ffe2ec73800d","amp;dn":"Beowulf+-+An+updated+verse+translation+-+Frederick+Rebsamen+%5BDer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4d1778a94cda2c7a3a6976c450ffe2ec73800d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,77,23,120,169,76,218,44,122,58,105,118,196,80,255,226,236,115,128,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
