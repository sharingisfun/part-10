Mackinnon\nEnglish\n2010 \nISBN: 189710653X \n251 pages \nPDF \n5.04 MB\n\n\n\nBridge, unlike chess, is a game of incomplete information. We bid with thirteen cards in view and play each deal seeing only twenty-six. We must deduce the positions of the rest from the auction and from the cards played. Some knowledge of the laws of probability is a critical weapon for any successful player.\n\nUsing a semi-fictional narrative approach, Bridge, Probability and Information develops the ideas of probability and information theory, applying them to bridge in a way no previous author has done. Concepts discussed include Vacant Spaces, Restricted Choice and how the split in one suit affects the probabilities in the others. Readers emerge with some very practical advice that will make them more successful players.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b9131a9cc0b165378396cf588a42d84046566a","amp;dn":"Bridge%2C+Probability+%26+Information-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b9131a9cc0b165378396cf588a42d84046566a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,185,19,26,156,192,177,101,55,131,150,207,88,138,66,216,64,70,86,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
