(AP, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-12-801775-3\r\n\r\nPlant Factory: An Indoor Vertical Farming System for Efficient Quality Food Production provides information on a field that is helping to offset the threats that unusual weather and shortages of land and natural resources bring to the food supply.\r\n\r\nAs alternative options are needed to ensure adequate and efficient production of food, this book represents the only available resource to take a practical approach to the planning, design, and implementation of plant factory (PF) practices to yield food crops. The PF systems described in this book are based on a plant production system with artificial (electric) lights and include case studies providing lessons learned and best practices from both industrial and crop specific programs.\r\n\r\nWith insights into the economics as well as the science of PF programs, this book is ideal for those in academic as well as industrial settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvides full-scope insight on plant farm, from economics and planning to life-cycle assessment\r\nPresents state-of-the-art plant farm science, written by global leaders in plant farm advancements\r\nIncludes case-study examples to provide real-world insights","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1233ec22c421197295c17045579b1b5ecf1a5c67","amp;dn":"Plant+Factory+-+An+Indoor+Vertical+Farming+System+for+Efficient+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1233ec22c421197295c17045579b1b5ecf1a5c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,51,236,34,196,33,25,114,149,193,112,69,87,155,27,94,207,26,92,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
