Here is my favorite Scholar to explain the Bible Line by Line. History and Science are added to the teachings confirming the Truth of the Bible in multiple ways.\n\nThe Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John on The Island of Patmos\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,\n\nThen we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.\n\n\n\nMany thanks to all the Film Makers that brought these facts to life.\n\nThe World Governments that are run by The Banksters, that are empowered by Lucifer, are The True Terrorists, only The Final Showdown between Lucifer and Jesus will save Mankind. We know who wins the Battle, The Creator of The Universe, of course!!!\n\nThe More You share the More shares you will receive, may Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.   \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.    \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.projectcamelot.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.projectcamelot.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt; \nListen to Alex Jones  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&lt;/a&gt; \n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.  \n\nEphesians 5:11\n\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n\n\n                                   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2044100e197dbd17cb1d29284e8547ebedf3356b","amp;dn":"POTHS+-+What+does+The+Bible+Mean+-+Line+by+Line+-+Chuck+Missler+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2044100e197dbd17cb1d29284e8547ebedf3356b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,68,16,14,25,125,189,23,203,29,41,40,78,133,71,235,237,243,53,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
