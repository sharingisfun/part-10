RealGuitar  is  a \n         sample-based  virtual  instrument  with an innovative approach to \n         guitar  sound  modeling  and  guitar part performing on keyboard. \n                   \n                   \n         The  true  power  of  RealGuitar lies in 3 brand new technologies \n         incorporated   in   this   innovative  guitar  performance  tool: \n                   \n                   \n         New  multi-channel  layering  technology,  incorporating a custom \n         library  of  specially  recorded samples taken from every fret of \n         all  6  strings  of  a  real  guitar.  The  unique  Floating Fret \n         Position  technology, which imitates change of fret position of a \n         guitarist's  hand  on the neck. This gives you the possibility of \n         playing  on  up  to  104  guitar  frets  using  just 43 keys of a \n         standard  keyboard!  Our original Guitar Touch technology letting \n         you  easily imitate basic guitar techniques (strumming, plucking, \n         sliding,  bending,  muting,  etc..), using standard MIDI keyboard \n         and  MIDI  controllers,  such  as Pitch Bender, Modulation Wheel, \n         Sustain Pedal, Aftertouch. \n                   \n         These  technologies  allow  to  closely emulate live guitar sound \n         and  techniques,  letting  you  perform guitar parts with a whole \n         new  level  of  realistic  expression.  Furthermore  they made it \n         possible  to  get  that  special  recognizable  sound  of  a real \n         12-string  guitar  using  samples taken from an ordinary 6 string \n         guitar,  as  well  as  to  achieve  true  Doubling (double track) \n         effect.   \n                   \n         RealGuitar  allows  to  use  rhythm  patterns  from  MIDI Pattern \n         Library  for easily creating guitar accompaniment tracks. All you \n         have  to  do  is  to  copy rhythm pattern to the needed number of \n         measures,  start  your  sequencer  and  use MIDI keyboard to play \n         chord  changes,  or  alternatively add chords to a MIDI track via \n         sequencer's editor. \n                   \n                   \n         RealGuitar features: \n                   \n         Sound:    \n                   \n         World famous guitars \n         High quality guitar samples \n         Every  fret  of  all  6  strings  including up/down/muted strokes \n         sampled New multi-channel sample layering technology \n         InFace sound concept \n         True Doubling (double track) effect \n         Built-in EQ and FX (Stereo Tremolo, 2-way Chorus) \n         Custom 32-bit sound engine \n                   \n         Performance: \n                   \n         Solo,   Harmony,   Bass&amp;amp;Chord,   Bass&amp;amp;Pick,   and   Chords  modes \n         1000  instant guitar chords + up strum, down strum, up/down muted \n         strum,  slow  strum  chords  1-4  note  chords  to 6-voice guitar \n         strums   real-time   translation   26  chord  types  recognition, \n         including  7th,  9th  and  altered  chords,  in any inversion and \n         voicing Automatic Fret position change \n         Strum speed adjustable \n         Repeat   Key   zone   (for   performing   repetitions,   tremolo, \n         up/down/muted  strums) Velocity switch articulations (slow strum, \n         slide  up/down,  bend,  reverse  bend,) Key switch guitar effects \n         (harmonics,   mute,  palm  mute,  body  smacks)  Slide  (up/down, \n         assignable number of steps) Hammer On, Pull Off \n         Tremolo (notes, chords) \n         Polyphonic  controllers (applying Pitch Bender, Modulation Wheel, \n         AfterTouch   to  individual  voices)  Automatic  Fret  Noise  and \n         Release Noise \n                   \n         Guitars:  RealGuitar  includes  555  MB  sample  set  featuring 8 \n         Acoustic guitar patches: \n                   \n                   \n         Steel Picked \n         Steel Fingered \n         Nylon Picked \n         Nylon Fingered \n         Steel 2 Picked \n         Steel 2 (Doubling) \n         12-string \n         Steel Stereo 290MB \n                   \n                   \n         more info available at: \n                   \n         http://www.musiclab.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcdc669eecf87503b89a0dee9734136063bcd47f","amp;dn":"MusicLab+RealGuitar+VSTi+DXi+RTAS+v1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcdc669eecf87503b89a0dee9734136063bcd47f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,220,102,158,236,248,117,3,184,154,13,238,151,52,19,96,99,188,212,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
