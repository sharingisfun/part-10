If you're looking for a recipe so that you can make your great grandfather a drink, this book might not be for you. However, this book does contain hundreds of the most popular cocktails, shots, martinis and more. These are drinks that someone has actually ordered since Prohibition. These are the drinks ordered and made TODAY! Hundreds of them! Whether you're a bartender and don't want to thumb through a million drinks to find a Long Island Iced Tea between a Lime Rickey and a Lord and Lady, or you're having some friends over for a party and you want to impress them with your favorite bar's most popular shots and bombs, then this book was written for YOU!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94ad433facdb483f0c62d3c7a7f3a80000ed6d44","amp;dn":"+The+Mixologist%27s+and+Bartender%27s+Ultimate+Cocktail+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94ad433facdb483f0c62d3c7a7f3a80000ed6d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,173,67,63,172,219,72,63,12,98,211,199,167,243,168,0,0,237,109,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
