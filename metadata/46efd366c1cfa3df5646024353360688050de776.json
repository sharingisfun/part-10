The show is not available for download anywhere on the web anymore, but it must be heard. It covers orthomolecular health and the dangers of toxins such as mercury, aluminum, vaccinations, pharmaceutical drugs and more. It has been edited down enough (by removing non-essential dialog, music, silence, breathing and words like &quot;um&quot;) to fit on a blank CD-R as a normal 700MB Audio CD.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46efd366c1cfa3df5646024353360688050de776","amp;dn":"Orthomolecular+Health%3A+Healing+Yourself-American_Tradition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46efd366c1cfa3df5646024353360688050de776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,239,211,102,193,207,163,223,86,70,2,67,83,54,6,136,5,13,231,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
