Page makes many \r\nmistakes in Dazed And Confused and Stairway To Heaven sounds by rote a \r\nhair but during the last hour the whole band seems to be returned from \r\nsluggishness. Sadly, several huge explosions distract the group \r\n(especially during the violin bow solo)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbd2964288366f3aa92e7929152de18921337bea","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.07.15+Buffalo%2C+NY+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbd2964288366f3aa92e7929152de18921337bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,210,150,66,136,54,111,58,169,46,121,41,21,45,225,137,33,51,123,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
