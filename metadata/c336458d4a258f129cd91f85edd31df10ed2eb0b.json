Johnson DDS MS \n\nThis comprehensive resource presents all aspects of endodontics, both surgical and nonsurgical. The very latest materials and methods used in providing endodontic treatment are explained thoroughly and effectively in the text and are highlighted visually through the generous use of illustrations, many in full-color. Key topics include diagnosis, access, working length determination, instrumentation, obturation, retreatment of failed nonsurgical cases, flap design, root-end resection, root end filling, post and core techniques, and core placement. \n\nDue to increased demand for endodontic treatment as a method for retaining teeth that would otherwise be extracted, general practitioners and endodontists are faced with not only the increased need, but more difficult cases. The specialty of endodontics is unique among the dental specialities requiring the successful clinician to integrate knowledge of many areas, including anatomy and morphology, histopathology, pharmacology, and microbiology.
