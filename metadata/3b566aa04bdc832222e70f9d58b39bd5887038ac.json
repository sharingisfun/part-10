Black-on-black deaths in the first two months of the year are double what they were last year. The team are guided around the most violent neighbourhoods by volunteer ex-gang members who risk their lives as they try to halt the vicious cycle of violence caused by revenge killings. Chicago is where Obama started his political career, but in his final Presidential year, his backyard is still plagued by violence, and there's less financial assistance to help deal with it. While few people blame Obama for that, many black people here feel there's less hope for the future than there ever has been.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/83/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/How-to-Stop-a-Murder-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3047Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~126Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 549 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b566aa04bdc832222e70f9d58b39bd5887038ac","amp;dn":"Ch4+Unreported+World+2016+How+to+Stop+a+Murder+720p+x264+AAC+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b566aa04bdc832222e70f9d58b39bd5887038ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,86,106,160,75,220,131,34,34,231,15,157,88,179,155,213,136,112,56,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
