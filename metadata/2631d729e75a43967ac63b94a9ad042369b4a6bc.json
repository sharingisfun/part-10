That's the revelation in Arturo Sandoval's lush, strings-graced new album, &quot;A Time for Love,&quot; a dinner-jazz gem that could be the zenith of his 20-plus-year recording career. An Afro-Cuban bebopper at heart whose torrid trumpet runs have been his signature, Sandoval changes course here to deliver long-toned lyrical ballads with a string orchestral backdrop and a fine quartet. He interprets several standards, including the Mandel-Mercer beauty &quot;Emily&quot; and Cole Porter's classic &quot;Every Time We Say Goodbye&quot; (featuring a soulful accompaniment by pianist Kenny Barron). But what differentiates Sandoval's excursion into reflective, slow-song territory from most other orchestral jazz projects is his expanded repertoire scope. With help from vocalist Monica Mancini, he gently colors Argentine tango composer Astor Piazzolla's &quot;Oblivion&quot; and gorgeously delves into two classical pieces, one of them being Maurice Ravel's &quot;Pavane Pour Une Infante Defunte,&quot; originally composed for two hand-horns. To be faithful to the composer's vision, Sandoval enlists simpatico trumpeter Chris Botti--a smart move, given the latter's romanticism. --Dan Ouellette\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2631d729e75a43967ac63b94a9ad042369b4a6bc","amp;dn":"Arturo+Sandoval+-+A+Time+for+Love+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2631d729e75a43967ac63b94a9ad042369b4a6bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,49,215,41,231,90,67,150,122,198,59,148,169,173,4,35,105,180,166,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
