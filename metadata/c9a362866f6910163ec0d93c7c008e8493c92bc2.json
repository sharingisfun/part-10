How are ancient civilizations linked together and what does it say about human instinct? Join Dr Kara Cooney, UCLA Professor of Egyptian Art and Architecture, as she visits tombs and temples around the world bringing an exciting new perspective to the most fascinating riddles in history.\n\n\n\n4)  Disposal of the Dead \nFor ancient Egyptians, the dead body was a precious thing meant to be preserved. Egyptian mummies, as well as mummies from cultures as diverse as the Moche of Peru or the first city dwellers of the Middle East, all represent an intense and expensive preparation of the dead. Egyptologist Dr. Kara Cooney examines tombs, graves, and burials all over the world, explaining that many cultures' methods of treating the dead embody a coping mechanism for dealing with death itself, one unavoidable element that links people around the world and throughout history.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2185 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 43:32.560\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 743 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a362866f6910163ec0d93c7c008e8493c92bc2","amp;dn":"DC.Out.of.Egypt.4of6.Disposal.of.the.Dead.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a362866f6910163ec0d93c7c008e8493c92bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,163,98,134,111,105,16,22,62,192,217,60,124,0,142,132,147,201,43,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
