You will learn from\nseveral of the instructors here at Digital-Tutors, as we go through many\nof the major parts of the software, and help you become a more\neffective CINEMA 4D artist. We will begin our training by exploring the\nuser interface, and discussing a number of features and concepts that\nwill be very important to know as we start to delve deeper into the\nsoftware. From this point, we will walk step-by-step through the process\nof modeling and texturing our own futuristic flying vehicle using\nCINEMA 4D and the built-in BodyPaint texturing suite. We will also guide\nyou through the entire process of rigging this vehicle for movement,\nand then animating the takeoff and flying sequence for this project.\nFrom there, we will learn how to use the standard CINEMA 4D particle\nsystem to create realistic steam for the refueling hose of our aircraft,\nand we will guide you through the process of setting up the lights,\nshadows, and using many rendering features in CINEMA 4D to finish out\nthis whole project. Finally, we will finish this CINEMA 4D tutorial by\ntaking you through MoGraph, an extremely powerful toolset in CINEMA 4D\nthat will allow you to create highly complex, very detailed motion\ngraphics with minimal effort.\n\n\nHome: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/11/training.php?pid=841&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/11/training.php?pid=841&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheers and keep seeding.
