RIAA snitcher David Brooks from Devon. What did you tell them?\nThat HHI is dropping rips like LSD? Call us crazy...We think they might already know that. Didn't your parents ever teach you that it's not nice to snitch? Especially when the people you try and snitch on can figure out who you are. Here's our doc drop dedicated to you. We're sure the information looks familiar, as it's yours.\n\n\nDavid Brooks BD ~BD~ BoaterDave\nJersey Cottage\n86 Granary Lane\nBudleigh Salterton\nDevon\nEX9 6ER\nUnited Kingdom\nPhone: 44-1395-443340\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6273b937e4b724b88264854387fb544f82a313","amp;dn":"Shinedown-Somewhere_In_The_Stratosphere-2CD-%28Retail%29-2011-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6273b937e4b724b88264854387fb544f82a313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,98,115,185,55,228,183,36,184,130,100,133,67,135,251,84,79,130,163,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
