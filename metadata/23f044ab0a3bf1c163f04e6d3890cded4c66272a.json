They are David Mitchell, Michael Sheen, Radio 1 DJ Jameela Jamil and Sarah Brown.\n\nThe nervous bakers get off to a crumbly start in the signature challenge (24 portions of shortbread), face one of Paul's notoriously difficult recipes in the technical challenge (six mini pork pies) and put their unique stamps on the showstopper bake (triple-tiered pavlova with fruit). Tensions are high and confusion is rife, but who will impress and who will miss the mark?\n\nJudged by legendary cookery writer Mary Berry and acclaimed master baker Paul Hollywood, these four will have to pull out all the stops to impress the judges and be crowned Comic Relief Star Baker.\n\nComedian Ed Byrne visits a Comic Relief-funded project in Uganda, showing how the money raised on Red Nose Day really does help change people's lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f044ab0a3bf1c163f04e6d3890cded4c66272a","amp;dn":"The+Great+Comic+Relief+Bake+Off+-+S02E03+-+SD-WebDL+--+STS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f044ab0a3bf1c163f04e6d3890cded4c66272a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,240,68,171,10,59,241,193,99,240,78,109,56,144,205,237,76,102,39,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
