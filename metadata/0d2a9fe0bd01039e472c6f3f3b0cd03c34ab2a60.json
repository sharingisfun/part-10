For one thing, when the project is conceptualized by 4AD Records brain-man Ivo Watts-Russell and includes artists from groundbreaking U.K. bands such as Cocteau Twins, Magazine, and Dead Can Dance, and when a chunk of the material is from musical heavyweights such as Tim Buckley (the haunting &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;), Alex Chilton of Big Star (the devastating &quot;Holocaust&quot; and the heartbreakingly lovely &quot;Kangaroo&quot;), and Colin Newman of Wire (the rockin&amp;#039; &quot;Not Me&quot;), you&amp;#039;re bound to come up with something that will be remembered and revered by old-school Goths everywhere. This is lush, hypnotic, astonishingly beautiful. --Lorry Fleming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d2a9fe0bd01039e472c6f3f3b0cd03c34ab2a60","amp;dn":"This+Mortal+Coil+-+It%5C%27ll+End+in+Tears+%5B1984%5D+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d2a9fe0bd01039e472c6f3f3b0cd03c34ab2a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,42,159,224,189,1,3,158,71,44,111,63,59,12,208,60,52,171,42,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
