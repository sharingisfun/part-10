Frozen for decades in a trance-like state, these men and women were given up as hopeless until 1969, when Dr. Oliver Sacks gave them the then-new drug L-DOPA, which had an astonishing, explosive, &quot;awakening&quot; effect. Dr. Sacks recounts the moving case histories of his patients, their lives, and the extraordinary transformations which went with their reintroduction to a changed world.\n\n&quot;One of the most beautifully composed and moving works of our time.&quot; (The Washington Post)\nPLEASE NOTE: Some changes have been made to the original manuscript with the permission of Oliver Sacks.
