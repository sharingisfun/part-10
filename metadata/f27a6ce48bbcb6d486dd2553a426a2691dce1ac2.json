Subjects include:\n-Arson and Bomb Scene Investigation\n-Ballistics and Gunshot Residue\n-Biometrics\n-Death Scene Investigation\n-High Tech Crime\n-Private Investigation\n-Serial Offenders\n\nThere are also various books that cover the law and forensics in general.  I have a few quick notes regarding this torrent.  So you aren&amp;#039;t surprised, obviously the death scene investigation books show REAL images of the deceased, to further educate the reader, so in short, the books can be pretty upsetting for some.  You have been warned.  Additionally, I DO have material regarding law enforcement, but that will be on another torrent I will put up within a week.\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world&amp;#039;s longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27a6ce48bbcb6d486dd2553a426a2691dce1ac2","amp;dn":"Forensics+%26+Investigation+Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27a6ce48bbcb6d486dd2553a426a2691dce1ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,122,108,228,139,188,182,212,134,221,37,83,164,38,162,105,29,206,26,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
