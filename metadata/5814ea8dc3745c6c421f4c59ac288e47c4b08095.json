The Fourth Edition focuses on the Five C's - character, creative thinking, critical thinking, communicating, and collaborating - the top 5 qualities employers seek in their employees. These five skills are addressed at the end of every chapter; supported by new content on Bloom's Taxonomy and professionalism; and emphasized in three new chapters on Character, Creative and Critical Thinking, and Collaborating. A renewed emphasis on the Master Student qualities is incorporated throughout the text, further supporting the Five C's. Through tools like the Discovery Wheel, Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI), Discovery and Intention journal entries, and hands-on activities, students gain a deeper understanding of themselves and learn to continually apply new skills as lifelong learners.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5814ea8dc3745c6c421f4c59ac288e47c4b08095","amp;dn":"From+Master+Student+to+Master+Employee%2C+4E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5814ea8dc3745c6c421f4c59ac288e47c4b08095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,20,234,141,195,116,92,108,66,31,76,89,172,40,142,71,196,176,128,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
