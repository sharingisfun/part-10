As a fan of Wu-Tang Clan I will give this a shot now. Enjoy!\n\nThis groundbreaking album is trail-blazing the collaboration between Dubstep and Hip-Hop, with stomach-pounding, bass-thumping guttural beats, and gully, gritty and grimy lyrics that break into the next decade in the chapters of each respective genreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history. With Scuba, Parson, Trillbass, Dakimh, DZ, Rogue Star, Stenchman, Datsik &amp; many more producing not remixes, but complex re-interpollations that include a veritable goldmine of Wu-Tang verses from the vaults that feature Raekwon, Ghostface Killa, RZA, GZA, Method Man, U-God &amp; Masta Killa, Wu affiliates Killah Priest, Bronze Nazareth, Prodigal Sunn, Solomon Childs, Son One &amp; more, and guest spots from Busta Rhymes, MF Doom, Pimp C, Three 6 Mafia, Ras Kass, Vast Aire, Canibus, Lord Jamar &amp; many more, this one of a kind compilation is at the forefront of an emerging cultural and musical blend that is taking place on the margins of the mainstream, but will be talked about for years to comeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\n   1.
