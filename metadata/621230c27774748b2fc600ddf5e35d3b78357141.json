Geraldine Chaplin stars as Elisa, who after an absence of 20 years is reunited with her father, Fernando Rey (in a superb performance, which won him the Cannes Film Festival &quot;Best Actor&quot; prize ). Having just divested herself of an unhappy marriage, Elisa hopes to heal old, long-standing family wounds. Inasmuch as Saura thrives on exploring &quot;unspeakable&quot; subjects in his films, one can gather that the relationship between Elisa and her father may be far more complex than it seems at first.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075983/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075983/&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:621230c27774748b2fc600ddf5e35d3b78357141","amp;dn":"Elisa.Vida.Mia.1977.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"621230c27774748b2fc600ddf5e35d3b78357141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,18,48,194,119,116,116,139,47,198,0,221,245,227,93,59,120,53,113,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
