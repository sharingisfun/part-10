Starting from the strengths of his classic Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering, Fourth Edition, in this volume H. Scott Fogler added new material and distilled the essentials for undergraduate students.\n \nFoglerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique way of presenting the material helps students gain a deep, intuitive understanding of the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essentials through reasoning, using a CRE algorithm, not memorization. He especially focuses on important new energy and safety issues, ranging from solar and biomass applications to the avoidance of runaway reactions.\n \nThoroughly classroom tested, this text reflects feedback from hundreds of students at the University of Michigan and other leading universities. It also provides new resources to help students discover how reactors behave in diverse situationsÃ¢â‚¬â€œincluding many realistic, interactive simulations on DVD-ROM.\n \nNew Coverage Includes\nGreater emphasis on safety: following the recommendations of the\nChemical Safety Board (CSB), discussion of crucial safety topics, including ammonium nitrate CSTR explosions, case studies of the nitroaniline explosion, and the T2 Laboratories batch reactor runaway\nSolar energy conversions: chemical, thermal, and catalytic water spilling\nAlgae production for biomass\nSteady-state nonisothermal reactor design: flow reactors with heat exchange\nUnsteady-state nonisothermal reactor design with case studies of reactor explosions\n\nNOTE:\nTHIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL EDITION. SOME PROBLEMS MAY DIFFER FROM U.S. RELEASE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde7fc2c151e6e7be3f691c892fe1087024314bf","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Chemical+Reaction+Engineering.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde7fc2c151e6e7be3f691c892fe1087024314bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,231,252,44,21,30,110,123,227,246,145,200,146,254,16,135,2,67,20,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
