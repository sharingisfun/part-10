Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders [2004], read by Bill Wallis (48 kbps / 44 kHz)\nThroughout his long and distinguished career John Mortimer's most famous character Horace Rumpole has mentioned his early and crowning victory of the Penge Bungalow Murders. And now after all these years Rumpole has decided to write his memoirs and tell of his great victory. When two war heroes are found murdered in their nearby homes the son of one of them becomes the prime suspect. Everything looks bleak for the young man until fate decrees that his junior counsel should be a young untried lawyer Horace Rumpole. Rumpole's leader C.H. Wystan QC plans to involve himself as little as possible and lose with dignity. But if there is one thing that Rumpole is not about to do it is to lose with dignity. The main question is if the accused didn't commit the murder then who did? That is the question that Rumpole must answer if he is going to save the seemingly doomed young man. (KAJ)\n\n#14. Rumpole and the Reign of Terror [2006], read by Bill Wallis (32 kbps / 22 kHz)\nJustice isn't blind - it's just a little short sighted and weak around the knees, A Rumpole novel which takes on New Labour and the Timson family and includes extracts from the memoirs of Hilda Rumpole aka 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'. Tiffany Timson's new husband Mahmoud Khan is arrested on suspicion of terrorism. Rumpole is frustrated in his defence campaign by New Labour laws that render the British legal system a farce - defending a suspected terrorist proves a tricky task even for the great defender. He insists upon a fair trial and his fight for justice brings him into confrontation not only with Hilda but also with the leaders of New Labour.\n\n#15. The Anti-social Beaviour of Horace Rumpole [2008], read by Bill Wallis (48 kbps / 44 kHz)\nASBOs (Anti-Social Behaviour Orders) may be the pride and joy of New Labour but they don't cut much ice with Horace Rumpole - he takes the old-fashioned view that if anyone is going to be threatened with a restriction of their liberty then some form of legal proceeding ought to be gone through first. Not that Hilda agrees of course but she's too busy completing her memoirs to dissuade him from taking an interest when one of the Timson children is given an ASBO for playing football in the street. And pretty soon he realizes something fishy is going on. Why are the residents pursuing their vendetta against the Timson boy quite so strongly? Could they have a sinister reason for not wanting him on their street? John Mortimer's delightful new Rumpole novel sees the magician of the Old Bailey and Pommeroy's Wine Bar at his implacable best as he defends our ancient freedoms even as he remains uneasy about what it is exactly Hilda is writing!\n\n#16. Rumpole at Christmas [2010], read by Bill Wallis (48 kbps / 44 kHz)\nPantos puds and a Father Christmas who isn't quite what he seems to be Rumpole isn't particularly fond of Christmas - time has a horrible habit of hanging heavily on the hands as the usual rituals are observed: exchanging presents with She Who Must Be Obeyed (a tie for him; lavender water for her) before settling down round the fire at Froxbury Mansions for a traditional turkey with all the trimmings and a bottle of Chateau Thames Embankment then the Queen's Speech and a glass of port. But at least the criminal fraternity never rests and many is the time Rumpole's 'celebrations' have been rudely interrupted. In these seven Christmas stories previously published only in magazines the call of justice (and a bit of excitement) leads Rumpole as far afield as a health farm in Norfolk and as near to home as a pantomime at the Tufnell Park Empire.\n\n\nThis is a good article on John Mortimer :\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984c0100e5235bac5e5cf04a2e9e468a4b38bff5","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Rumpole+of+the+Bailey+Collection+-+John+Mortimer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984c0100e5235bac5e5cf04a2e9e468a4b38bff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,76,1,0,229,35,91,172,94,92,240,74,46,158,70,138,75,56,191,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
