It reached #1 in the UK charts. &quot;Baby Don't Dance&quot; and &quot;Only In My Dreams&quot; were the only songs not released as singles, although promotional copies for &quot;Baby Don't Dance&quot; have surfaced since the group's split. It is notable that the singles &quot;You'll Be Sorry&quot; and &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; were not included on the compilation, even though their counterparts did. The US version was released under the name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Best of StepsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. The version of &quot;One for Sorrow&quot; on this album is the original mix, not the US Mix. The compilation features three songs previously unavailable in the US - &quot;Better Best Forgotten&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, and &quot;Words Are Not Enough&quot;. It is also surprising to note that &quot;When I Said Goodbye&quot;, one of Steps's biggest UK hits did not make it onto the US version.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By John Galilee  - Countless tribute and sound-a-like bands have had various stabs at mimicking the magic of ABBA. Of the bunch, Steps have been the most successful in their attempts to nurture a similar ABBA-esque musical style and image. It comes as no surprise that Steps should call their &quot;best of&quot; anthology Gold, just like the best-selling &quot;best of&quot; from their Swedish heroes. The ABBA influences can be heard right from their earliest material--&quot;One For Sorrow&quot; to &quot;After The Love Has Gone&quot; (October 1999), through to newer compositions such as &quot;Baby Don't Dance&quot; (an updated version of &quot;Voulez-Vous?&quot;). Released at the peak of the line-dancing craze in the UK, their thigh-slapping debut &quot;5,6,7,8&quot; thus sounds remarkably out of place. Proving that they're no puppets of Mr Waterman, the Euro-pop style &quot;Only In My Dreams&quot; is the first song written by Steps as a group. Their cover of Diana Ross's 1986 number one &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; looks destined, along with &quot;Tragedy&quot; and the 70s disco inspired hit &quot;Stomp&quot;, to become the songs which future generations will best remember Claire, Faye, Lisa, H and Lee for.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Tragedy\n[02] One For Sorrow\n[03] Stomp\n[04] Better Best Forgotten\n[05] Love's Got A Hold On My Heart\n[06] Deeper Shade Of Blue\n[07] Last Thing On My Mind\n[08] Better The Devil You Know\n[09] Summer Of Love\n[10] 5, 6, 7, 8\n[11] Chain Reaction\n[12] Baby Don't Dance\n[13] It's The Way You Make Me Feel\n[14] After The Love Has Gone\n[15] Here And Now\n[16] Say You'll Be Mine\n[17] Only In My Dreams\n[18] Words Are Not Enough\n[19] When I Said Goodbye\n[20] Heartbeat\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:15m:29s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 185mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I- Tunes v7.1.1.5 Mp3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 15 October 2001 [EU]\nRecord Company\t&gt; Jive Zomba Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.pop-music.com/steps\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_%28group%29\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/s/steps.html\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/steps\n&gt;[Last Thing On My Mind]\n&gt;[Chain Reaction]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73ca232aadaa68a1deb6de89a409d41e2c6e2b54","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Gold+%28Greatest+Hits%29+-+Steps+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73ca232aadaa68a1deb6de89a409d41e2c6e2b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,202,35,42,173,170,104,161,222,182,222,137,164,9,212,30,44,110,43,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
