This is primarily used for playing games with poor or no controller support, but Xpadder can be used in a web browser, media player, or almost any other application. Xpadder supports the use of up to 26 controllers simultaneously and if a controller supports it, Xpadder can assign a button to make the controller rumble/vibrate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158a4b86c413378e8a3e649fdf95b11660c75552","amp;dn":"Xpadder+v5.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158a4b86c413378e8a3e649fdf95b11660c75552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,138,75,134,196,19,55,142,138,62,100,159,223,149,177,22,96,199,85,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
