In 1899, it was founded and edited by Adelaide Alsop Robineau, one of the premier ceramicists in America, and creator of the famed &quot;Scarab Vase&quot;. Robineau  was a tireless promoter of the studio pottery and china painting movements, and her magazine is a valuable source of information on potters, techniques and potting-related news and designs of the period.
