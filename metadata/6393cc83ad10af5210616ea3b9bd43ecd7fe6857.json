Actually he's a British agent, working undercover to rescue a Czech inventor from the \n\nGestapo. The inventor's daughter (Margaret Lockwood) becomes the unwitting pawn of a genuine Nazi (Paul von \n\nHernreid, just before he became Paul Henreid) during a long train ride from Germany to France and back again. \n\nDirector Carol Reed never denied that his inspiration for Night Train was Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (both films \n\nwere written by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat). The homage was solidified by the presence in Night Train of two \n\ncarryovers from the Hitchcock  film: those ardent British cricket fans Charters and Caldicott (Basil Radford and \n\nNaunton Wayne). Night Train was liberally adapted from the Gordon Wellesley novel Report on a Fugitive. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Night Train to Munich.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.49 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 234 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 1 840 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.250\n      Stream size : 1.23 GiB (82%)\n      Writing library : XviD 56\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 384 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 262 MiB (17%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032842/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032842/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCriterion rip, posted at KG by crasus, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6393cc83ad10af5210616ea3b9bd43ecd7fe6857","amp;dn":"Carol+Reed+-+Night+Train+to+Munich+%281940%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6393cc83ad10af5210616ea3b9bd43ecd7fe6857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,147,204,131,173,16,175,82,16,97,110,163,185,189,67,236,215,254,104,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
