In PARADA a life-saving operation on a gangsterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pitbull terrier brings together two very different worlds: old school machismo meets gay obsession for interior design, homophobia meets overblown gender display as a number of former foes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Serbs, Bosnian Muslims, Kosovo-Albanians and Croatian war veterans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ find themselves obliged to form a tenuous bond with a bunch of gay activists. This motley crew are sent on an impossible and probably suicidal mission to protect a fresh attempt to hold a Gay Pride parade from renewed and certain onslaught from nationalists and neo-Nazi organisations and make the event a success. Srdjan DragojeviÃ„â€¡Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s film takes a look at survival strategies for gays in Serbia and at a society that even now, years after the Balkan war, is still fragmented and riven by two entrenched fronts. And, as one would expect from any comedy worthy of the name, no matter how tumultuous the plot, real-life tragedy is always hovering in the background, just a step away.\n\nRip Specs\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 1.46 GiB\nDuration : 1h 50mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 889 Kbps\n\nVideo\nCodec : XviD\nBit rate : 1 432 Kbps\nWidth : 704 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat : AC-3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1784575/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1784575/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Serbian\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\nSrdjan Dragojevic - Parada (2011)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d50446adf3f0c441ef20360a9dc908ceeeda4be3","amp;dn":"Srdjan+Dragojevic+-+Parada+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d50446adf3f0c441ef20360a9dc908ceeeda4be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,4,70,173,243,240,196,65,239,32,54,10,157,201,8,206,238,218,75,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
