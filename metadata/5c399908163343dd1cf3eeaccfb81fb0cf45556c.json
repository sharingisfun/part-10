A four disc set, this essential collection includes ALL the recordings Bernard Herrmann conducted in London of his OWN film music for the Decca International record label in the late 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and early 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s (of course, Herrmann recorded, at that time, many other composersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work). The orchestras performing under HerrmannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership are the London Philharmonic and National Philharmonic Orchestras.\n\nThe boxed set from which this music is derived has been out of print for over 15 years and is estimated to be valued at approximately $350.00. Some of these suites have been released on various Herrmann CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s but here we have ALL of them, and in top quality lossless sound! I hope everyone will enjoy these recordings (nearly three hours of GREAT music), which should be part of any serious film music library. See below for links.
