Some jazz fans may cringe at his versions of 'Christmas Song' and Whitney Houston's 'The Greatest Love of All,' but the music displays a heartfelt spirituality as opposed to financial slickness. It is the opposite of Sanders' characteristic fire-breathing tenor of his Impulse days, but there is nobility in taking this tranquil direction; Sanders refuses to repeat himself. He demands you listen with open ears, dropping preconceived notions. For instance, unlike the adult contemporary direction taken by one-time free jazz tenor titan Gato Barbieri, this date doesn't sound like a polished commercial venture as much as a quiet, meditative one. The use of tabla, sarod, and chandrasarang adds to the session's spiritual nature. ~ Al Campbell, AMG\n\nThis is a Sanders'cd I would recommend to all those who have heard of Sanders as a wild musician,shrieking through the saxophone. Here,he is in a very mellow, ,not to say soft ,mood.Religiosity or more accurately,spirituality permeates all the numbers on this cd.He reminds us of an evening service in a protestant church. Even those who are not fanatic jazz fans but like music with rythm should enjoy this cd which is definitely,one of the best this African-American Griot has produced. ~ A customer\n\nPersonnel:\nPharoah Sanders ( Tenor Saxophone ) \nWilliam Henderson ( Piano and Synthesizer ) \nJohn Hicks ( Piano ) - 7 \nBrian McLaughlin ( Tabla ) - 5 \nLynn Tausig ( Sarod and Chandrasarang ) - 5 \nAlvin Queen ( Drums ) - 5 \n\nPharoah Sanders - A Prayer Before Dawn Tracks:\n01  The Light At The Edge Of The World ( Piero Piccioni ) 5:11 \n02  Dedication To James W.
