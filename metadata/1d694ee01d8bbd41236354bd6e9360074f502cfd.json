Amen M.D, &quot;Making a Good Brain Great: The Amen Clinic Program for Achieving and Sustaining Optimal Mental Performance&quot;\nISBN: 1400082080 | 2005 | EPUB\n\nDaniel Amen, M.D., one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost authorities on the brain, has news for you: your brain is involved in everything you doÃ¢â‚¬â€learn to care for it properly, and you will be smarter, healthier, and happier in as little as 15 days!\n\nYou probably run, lift weights, or do yoga to keep your body in great shape; you put on sunscreen and lotions to protect your skin; but chances are you simply ignore your brain and trust it to do its job. People unknowingly endanger or injure their brains, stress them by working at a frenzied pace and not getting enough sleep, pollute them with caffeine, alcohol, and drugs, and deprive them of proper nutrients. Brain dysfunction is the number one reason people fail at school, work, and relationships. The brain is the organ of learning, working, and lovingÃ¢â‚¬â€the supercomputer that runs our lives. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very simple: when our brains work right, we work rightÃ¢â‚¬â€and when our brains have trouble, we have trouble in our lives.\n\nLuckily, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never too late: the brain is capable of change, and when you care for it, the results are amazing. Making a Good Brain Great gives you the tools you need to optimize your brain power and enrich your health and your life in the process. The principles and exercises in this book, based on years of cutting-edge neuroscience research and the experiences of thousands of people, provide a wealth of practical information to teach you how to achieve the best brain possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d694ee01d8bbd41236354bd6e9360074f502cfd","amp;dn":"Making+a+Good+Brain+Great%3A+++Optimal+Mental+Performance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d694ee01d8bbd41236354bd6e9360074f502cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,105,78,224,29,139,189,65,35,99,84,189,110,147,96,7,79,80,44,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
