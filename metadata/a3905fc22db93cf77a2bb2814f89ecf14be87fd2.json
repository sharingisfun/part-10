Blake turns to Sam Elliot, who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the businessman he expected. Instead, Blake is faced with Samantha Elliot, beautiful and feisty with a voice men call 1-900 numbers to hear.\n\nSamantha Elliot:\nOwner of matchmaking firm Alliance and not on the marital menuÃ¢â‚¬Â¦that is, until Blake offers her ten million dollars for a one-year contract. And thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing indecent about this proposal. The money will really help with her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s medical bills. All Samantha will need to do is keep her attraction to her new husband to herself and avoid his bed. \n\nBut BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toe-curling kisses and sexy charm prove too difficult for Sam to resist. It was a marriage contract that planned for everythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦except falling in love. \n\nMarried by Monday (The Weekday Brides #2) by Catherine Bybee (June 5th 2012) \n\nCarter Billings: \nSandy blond hair and Hollywood good looks, Carter Billings could have any woman he wants. However, when he makes his bid for the Governor's seat in the state of California, he needs to settle down and become a family man. Eliza, the woman he secretly adores, embodies the perfect amount of spice and passion to suit his marital needs, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not interested in becoming Mrs. Billings. She can't even stand to be in the same room with him.\n\nEliza Havens:\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much easier to drive Carter away than to give into desire. Matching couples is how she earns a living, but getting married isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an option. The secrets she carries are too dangerous to entangle anyone else. When her hidden identity and past threaten her future, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left with little choice. Carter is quick to offer solutions to both their problems, but saying yes could mean endangering the man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing to love.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3905fc22db93cf77a2bb2814f89ecf14be87fd2","amp;dn":"The+Weekday+Brides+Series+%281-2%29+by+Catherine+Bybee+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3905fc22db93cf77a2bb2814f89ecf14be87fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,144,95,194,45,185,60,247,122,43,178,129,79,137,236,241,75,232,127,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
