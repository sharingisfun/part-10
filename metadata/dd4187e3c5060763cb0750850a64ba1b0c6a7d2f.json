This complicated process was supervised by producer Carl Macek, a pioneer of the anime industry in United States.\n\nThis combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations as mankind must fight three destructive Robotech Wars in succession over a powerful energy source called &quot;Protoculture.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nThe seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ three chapters included The Macross Saga, The Robotech Masters, and The New Generation. Released in 1985, Robotech was the first anime (Japanese animation) series that many fans had seen, and is often accredited as the cause of the anime fandom that continues to grow today in the United States.\n\n----------------------\n\nThe New Generation (the third Robotech war) begins with the arrival on Earth of the Invid, who are lured by the Flower of Life and rapidly conquer the planet. References in the previous two chapters explain to viewers that many of the heroes of the First Robotech War had left Earth to seek out the Robotech Masters on a preemptive mission, and it is this Robotech Expeditionary Force that sends missions back from across the galaxy to attempt a liberation of their homeworld. The storyline follows one group of freedom fighters as they work their way towards the final battle with the Invid.\n\n----------------------\n\nThis is from the original DVD, put out by ADV films in 2001.  These are the un-remasted, first time on DVD sets.\nThese episodes are saved as Season 03.  The other labels are based on the DVD labels.\n\n----------------------\n\nROBOTECH - THE NEW GENERATION (Episodes 61 through 85)\n\n-The Next Wave -A Defeated Planet, A Powerful Alien Enemy\nEps 61 - The Invid Invasion\nEps 62 - The Lost City\nEps 63 - Lonely Soldier Boy\nEps 64 - Survival\nEps 65 - Curtain Call\nEps 66 - Hard Times\nEps 67 - Paper Hero\n\n-Counter Strike -Survival of the Fittest\nEps 68 - Eulogy\nEps 69 - The Genesis Pit\nEps 70 - Enter Marlene\nEps 71 - The Secret Route\nEps 72 - The Fortress\nEps 73 - Sandstorms\n\n-Genesis -The World Will Never Be the Same\nEps 74 - Annie's Wedding\nEps 75 - Separate Ways\nEps 76 - Metamorphosis\nEps 77 - The Midnight Sun\nEps 78 - Ghost Town\nEps 79 - Frostbite\n\n-Hollow Victory -The Final Battle to Save the Earth\nEps 80 - Birthday Blues\nEps 81 - Hired Gun\nEps 82 - The Big Apple\nEps 83 - Reflex Point\nEps 84 - Dark Finale\nEps 85 - Symphony of Light\n\n------------------\n\nThese extras are from The New Generation DVDs.\n\n----------------------\n\nROBOTECH - The New Generation EXTRAS\n\n01 - Promo - Legend of Crystania\n02 - Promo - Those Who Hunt Elves\n03 - Promo - Princess Nine\n04 - Promo - Soul Hunter\n05 - Promo - Dirty Par Flash Mission 3\n06 - Promo - Nadia Secret of Blue Water\n07 - Promo - Soul Hunter\n08 - International Clips/Selected Scenes\n09 - International Clips/Selected Scenes\n10 - International Clips/Selected Scenes (option for audio in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian)\n11 - International Clips/Selected Scenes (option for audio in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian)\n12 - Unaired Pilot for Genesis Climber Mospeada\n13 - Prototype Toy Presentation\n14 - Promotional Videos\n15 to 28 - Selected Deleted Scenes from Macross Saga, Southern Cross and Mospeada\n29 to 42 - Merchandise Gallery (action figures, clothing, etc.)\n43 to 44 - Merchandise Promo\n45 to 46 - Video Games (past and future)\n47 - TV Promo\n\n*Don't hit and quit.
