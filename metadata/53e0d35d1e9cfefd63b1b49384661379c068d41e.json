Waits doesn't break any new creative ground here but continues to refine his down-and-out persona. It's booze and broads, sex and violence, laughs and heartbreak. This 1978 album opens with an astonishingly desperate version of &quot;Somewhere&quot; (from &quot;West Side Story&quot;), performed like Louie Armstrong with a migraine. From there it's the usual Waits mix of crackpot wordplay and the cocktail lounge jazz likes of &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Vocals - Tom Waits\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Electric Guitar - Tom Waits, Ray Crawford, Roland Bautista, Alvin &quot;Shine&quot; Robinson\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bass - Scott Edwards, Jim Hughart, Byron Miller\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Piano - Da Willie Gonga (George Duke), Harold Battiste, Tom Waits\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Organ - Charles Kynard\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tenor Saxophone - Herbert Hardesty, Frank Vicari\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Drums - Rick Lawson, Earl Palmer, Chip White\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Congas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bobbye Hall Porter \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Orchestra - Bob Alcivar\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 - Somewhere (From 'West Side Story')\n02 - Red Shoes by the Drugstore\n03 - Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis\n04 - Romeo Is Bleeding\n05 - 29 Dollars\n06 - Wrong Side of the Road\n07 - Whistlin' Past the Graveyard\n08 - Kentucky Avenue\n09 - A Sweet Little Bullet From a Pretty Blue Gun\n10 - Blue Valentines\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e0d35d1e9cfefd63b1b49384661379c068d41e","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Blue+Valentine++%5B1978%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e0d35d1e9cfefd63b1b49384661379c068d41e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,224,211,93,30,156,254,253,99,177,180,147,132,102,19,121,192,104,212,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
