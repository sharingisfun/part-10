Although his allegiance is to Britain, his mother was from an aristocratic Bavarian family, and he spent his summers in Germany as a child. When Geoffrey is approached by a German spy who offers him a chance to defect, he reports the incident to his superiors, but instead of arresting the spy they suggest that he accept her offer--and become an Allied agent. In Germany, among old friends, Geoffrey discovers that loyalty is more complicated than he expected, especially when he finds himself aboard the maiden voyage of a powerful new prototype Zeppelin, headed for Scotland on a secret mission that could decide the outcome of the war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357cdc34481b4374c510299afdc58af3a49b1f1a","amp;dn":"ZEPPELIN+%28MOVIE+1971%29_Michael+York_+DVDrip.XVID.CHEZ2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357cdc34481b4374c510299afdc58af3a49b1f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,124,220,52,72,27,67,116,197,16,41,154,253,197,138,243,164,155,31,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
