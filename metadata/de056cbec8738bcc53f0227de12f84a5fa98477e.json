Mona singer and guitarist Nick Brown and Kings of Leon bassist Jared Followill recorded the EP within a week at Brown's home in Nashville, Tennessee. They mixed and produced the EP and Brown engineered it. A press statement says recording was &quot;fueled by multiple bottles of red wine and a shared fascination with timbre, rhythm, and aural adventure,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which resulted in an Ã¢â‚¬Å“evocative and original melding of oceanic rock with bottomless grooves and hypnotic dub textures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de056cbec8738bcc53f0227de12f84a5fa98477e","amp;dn":"Smoke+%26amp%3B+Jackal+-+EP+No.+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de056cbec8738bcc53f0227de12f84a5fa98477e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,5,108,190,200,115,139,204,83,240,34,125,225,47,132,165,250,152,71,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
