Cale\nThe Silvertone Years (2011)\n\n\nWith his laid-back rootsy style, J.J. Cale is best known for writing &quot;After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Cocaine,&quot; songs that Eric Clapton later made into hits. But Cale's influence wasn't only through songwriting -- his distinctly loping sense of rhythm and shuffling boogie became the blueprint for the adult-oriented roots rock of Clapton and Mark Knopfler, among others. Cale's refusal to vary the sound of his music over the course of his career caused some critics to label him as a one-trick pony, but he managed to build a dedicated cult following with his sporadically released recordings.\n\nBorn in Oklahoma City but raised in Tulsa, OK, Cale played in a variety of rock &amp; roll bands and Western swing groups as a teenager, including one outfit that also featured Leon Russell. In 1959, at the age of 21, he moved to Nashville, where he was hired by the Grand Ole Opry's touring company. After a few years, he returned to Tulsa, where he reunited with Russell and began playing local clubs. In 1964, Cale and Russell moved to Los Angeles with another local Oklahoma musician, Carl Radle.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\tConstant Bit Rate 128 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Hold On Baby\n02.Artificial Paradise\n03.Lean On Me\n04.Lonesome Train\n05.Tijuana\n06.That Kind Of Thing\n07.Shanghaid\n08.River Boat Song\n09.No Time\n10.Who's Talking\n11.Shady Grove\n12.New Orleans\n13.Lady Luck\n14.She's In Love\n15.Passion\n16.Take Out Some Insurance\n17.Jailer\n18.Change Your Mind\n19.Feeling In Love\n20.Humdinger\n21.Traces\n22.Roll On Mama\n23.Low Rider\n24.Disadvantage\n25.End Of The Line\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d73d62eb588020353fa6758f29e5329afbc9720c","amp;dn":"J.J.+Cale+-+The+Silvertone+Years+%282011%29+Rock+Mp3+128","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d73d62eb588020353fa6758f29e5329afbc9720c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,61,98,235,88,128,32,53,63,166,117,143,41,229,50,154,251,201,114,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
