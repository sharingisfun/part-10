Like a steamroller tearing down a house, Scott Henderson and company comes shining through with Tore Down House, a gripping list of songs that beg the listener to truly appreciate the blues. Throughout the compilation, Henderson explores his diverse range of blues improvisation, using a plethora of pedals and effects, but not as so to diminish the full strength of the classic Fender Strat sound. &quot;Dolemite&quot; gets the jam going with a spontaneous free-for-all blues session. &quot;I Hate You&quot; is a romantic, witty ballad seemingly coming from the lost decade of the &amp;#039;50s. &quot;Darling you ruined my life/so I hate you and I always will,&quot; sings guest Thelma Houston with chants of &quot;You suck&quot; in the background, granting a message of what one would feel about those who can&amp;#039;t stand to be around that certain someone that&amp;#039;s destroying their life. &quot;Take this job and shove it./I&amp;#039;m going to guitar school,&quot; shouts the fiery Henderson in the rocking blues breaker, &quot;Gittar School.&quot; With six other surprises featured on Tore Down House, it&amp;#039;s a sure bet the first time listener of this artist&amp;#039;s art will become a longtime fan. His band features a splendid group of experienced blues rockers, such as the likes of Pat O&amp;#039;Brien on harmonica, Dave Carpenter on bass, Kirk Covington on drums, Scott Kinsley on keyboards, and a host of sax, trumpet, and other brass players. This is a hands down classic blues album and a must for those who are crazy for the genre. \n\n\nTo check out all TQMP uploads:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&lt;/a&gt;\nOr use the TQMP searchtag.\n\nPlease feel free to join TQMP!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980&amp;#039;s cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format (flac is preferable) AND include artwork.
