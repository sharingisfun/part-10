The band won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for the song &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; in 2001. The band broke up in 2004 after three multi-platinum albums, selling more than 30 million albums worldwide[citation needed]. In late 2008, rumors began circulating that Creed was planning a 2009 reunion.\n\n\n\nMy Own Prison \n\nMy Own Prison is the debut album by Creed, released on June 18, 1997 (see 1997 in music). It has been certified 6x platinum and is one of the top 200 selling albums of all time in the United States. The person kneeling on the album's cover is Justin Brown, a friend of the band. The picture was taken by Mark Tremonti's brother, Daniel, for a photography class.\n\nWind-up Records intends to reissue the album in a 10th Anniversary Special package. This was slated for a release of November 13, 2007 but has been delayed.\n\nOver the course of Creed's career, the album has gone on to sell 6 million copies. The album has sold very well considering it was not originally released with any major media coverage, as Creed was an unknown band at the time. However, radio station DJs said that when they played &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, they instantly got swamped with calls from people wanting to know whose song it was.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Torn&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:23 \n2.\t&quot;Ode&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 \n3.\t&quot;My Own Prison&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 \n4.\t&quot;Pity for a Dime&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29 \n5.\t&quot;In America&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 \n6.\t&quot;Illusion&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37 \n7.\t&quot;Unforgiven&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \n8.\t&quot;Sister&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56 \n9.\t&quot;What's This Life For&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 \n10.\t&quot;One&quot; (Stapp/Tremonti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a1f93bdc157ecab9d6f5fa42793da62518b59e5","amp;dn":"Creed+-+My+Own+Prison+%281997%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a1f93bdc157ecab9d6f5fa42793da62518b59e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,31,147,189,193,87,236,171,157,111,95,164,39,147,218,98,81,139,89,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
