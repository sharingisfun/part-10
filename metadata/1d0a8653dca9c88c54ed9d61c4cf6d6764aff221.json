Gould produced the documentaries as individual works between 1967 and 1977, then collected them under the title Solitude Trilogy, reflecting the theme of &quot;withdrawal from the world&quot; that unites the pieces. They are &quot;as close to an autobiographical statement as [he intended] to get in radio&quot;.\n\n-- from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude_Trilogy)\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hermitary.com/solitude/gould.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hermitary.com/solitude/gould.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sociologicalimagination.org/archives/5882&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sociologicalimagination.org/archives/5882&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0a8653dca9c88c54ed9d61c4cf6d6764aff221","amp;dn":"The+Solitude+Trilogy+%28Glenn+Gould%2C+CBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0a8653dca9c88c54ed9d61c4cf6d6764aff221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,10,134,83,220,169,200,140,84,237,157,97,196,207,109,103,100,175,242,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
