This much overlooked album[which A&amp;M failed to promote adequately]ranks as a favorite among his musical peers. Joe turns in some unbelievable vocal performances on such tunes as &quot;The Jealous Kind&quot;, &quot;A Song For You&quot;, &quot;She is My Lady&quot; and &quot;The Worrier&quot;[which Features Eric Clapton on guitar]. The soulful rhythm section is anchored by Joe's then backup band Stuff with lead guitarist Eric Gale providing flawless guitar solo's throughout. Great backup vocals are provided by Patti Austin, Deniece Williams and Bonnie Bramlet. The late Peter Tosh makes a cameo as well on the Dylan tune &quot;The Man in Me&quot;. It's been said by a prior review of this album many years ago by James Chrispell&quot;Stingray is full of gems worth seeking out&quot;. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f6fb3fda3e36a38ed32793296016f5459c53de","amp;dn":"Joe+Cocker+-+Stingray%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f6fb3fda3e36a38ed32793296016f5459c53de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,246,251,63,218,62,54,163,142,211,39,147,41,96,22,245,69,156,83,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
