Jean has accrued a lifetime of experience in a few short years, from highlight performances on The Colbert Report, Conan, Late Show With David Letterman and The Grand Old Opry stage to having one of her songs used as the theme for the television series ElviraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Movie Macabre. \n\n\n\nProduced by Jack White, Bathtub Love Killings showcases Jean as a songwriting force to be reckoned with. Playing damn-near every instrument she could get her hands on, the result is a well-rounded, catchy record thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chock-a-block full of ear worm moments. \n\n\n\nBathtub Love Killings will be available everywhere on LP, CD and digital on October 14th. A limited edition lavender colored vinyl version will also be available via Third Man Records.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:174b8f3bd5d45b7c42dbc391664c1882f86cab76","amp;dn":"Olivia+Jean+-+Bathtub+Love+Killings+%282014%29+Third+Man+Records+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"174b8f3bd5d45b7c42dbc391664c1882f86cab76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,75,143,59,213,212,91,124,66,219,195,145,102,76,24,130,248,108,171,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
