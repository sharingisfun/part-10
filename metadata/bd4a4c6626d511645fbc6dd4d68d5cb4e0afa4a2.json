Deep in the undeveloped backwoods of the Blue Ridge Mountains, two young men are caught in the midst of an ancient and bitter feud between two families and fighting for the romantic attention of a beautiful woman (Sylvia Sidney). \n\nOne of the most breathtaking movies ever to hit the silver screen, The Trail of the Lonesome Pine is an exciting melodrama and a landmark cinematic achievement that continues to captivate audiences today.\n\nThat's Henry Hathaway standing on the left, next to Nigel Bruce.At the table are Fred MacMurray, Henry Fonda and Fred Stone.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 737mb\nDuration.... 01:39:32\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 921kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 103kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd4a4c6626d511645fbc6dd4d68d5cb4e0afa4a2","amp;dn":"The+Trail+of+the+Lonesome+Pine+1936+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd4a4c6626d511645fbc6dd4d68d5cb4e0afa4a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,74,76,102,38,213,17,100,95,188,109,212,214,141,92,180,224,175,164,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
