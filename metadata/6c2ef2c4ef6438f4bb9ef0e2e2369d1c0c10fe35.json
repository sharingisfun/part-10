For the first time ever, view the authors who brewed the words in corrupt new bible versions, such as the TNIV, NIV, NKJV, ESV, NASB, and HCSB. College president Dr. Norris Belcher said, This book takes you to the head of the stream, where you will see the men, standing with sticks in hand, stirring up the mud to cloud the pure water of God's word, the King James Bible.\n\nQUESTIONING THE WORD OF GOD came first with the serpent's skeptical query, Yea, hath God said...? (Gen.3). Questioning today's Holy Bible is just as rebellious as questioning ones gender. God did it right the first time. A man-made makeover brings confusion and defaces and mutilates God's creation. Only pride and perversion would propel men to presume that they could improve upon God's own handiwork. This book will bring Greek and Hebrew study out of the closet for the first time. Tumbling out come the starving skeletons of the authors of Greek and Hebrew study tools, lexicons and editions, the sordid sources from which new versions, such as the NIV, TNIV, NKJV, ESV, NASB, and HCSB take their corrupt words. These are the very same study aids which kill a sermon or Bible study when used to define a word in the Holy Bible. Lexicon and Bible dictionary authors dug down into the depths of pagan lore, then ransacked the English dictionary to find a match which could burn the Bible word-by-word. The smoke darkens the directing light of the holy scriptures. This book will document that men who want to change and redefine the Holy Bible are likely to want to change anything even Bible doctrine, their own gender, and their god. For example, Luciferian connections shadow Trench's New Testament Synonyms and Ginsburg's TBS Hebrew Masoretic text.\n\nYou will learn such things as the connection between new version editor and child molester C.J. Vaughan and tools such as Strong's Concordance, Vine's Expository Dictionary, the Unitarian J.H. Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon, Moulton's Lexicon and Vincent and Wuest's Word Studies. Heresy trials deposed editors of the popular Hebrew-English Lexicon by Brown, Driver, and Briggs and the New Testament Greek-English Lexicon by Frederick Danker. All Greek-English New Testament lexicons plagiarize the first Greek-English lexicon written by Scott and Liddell, who harbored the pedophile author of Alice in Wonderland, who took improper photographs of Liddell's child and remains a suspect in the Jack the Ripper murder case. The book demonstrates that Greek texts from UBS to TBS fail to reach the perfection of the Holy Bible, where God's words shall not pass away. Why are good Christians putting aside their inspired Bibles to look for light in conflicting and ununinspired Greek &amp; Hebrew tools, made by men who denied its truths?\n\n\nAbout the author:\nGail Anne Riplinger (born 1947) is an American writer and speaker known for her support of the inerrancy of the King James Bible.
