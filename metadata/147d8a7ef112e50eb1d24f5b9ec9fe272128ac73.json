Pull up a chair. Good company. Great food. No rules. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potluck.\n\nWhen Nancy Vienneau started a casual potluck celebrating good food and goodwill, she had no idea it would be going strong five years later. The ever-changing group of diverse people who attend have one thing in common: a dedication to good food. As a result, every month, a non-scripted parade of seasonally inspired dishes appearsÃ¢â‚¬â€dishes that draw on ingredients from the participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own gardens, their neighbors yards, or the farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ market. These dishes celebrate their provenance and their history. Roasted tomato goat cheese tart with Tennessee Bradley tomatoes, Me-meÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chocolate cake inherited from a beloved grandmotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recipe. Chicken baked with fresh plums from a neighborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tree. Acorn squash filled with Southern sorghum and pecans. Pimiento cheese made with local farmstead cheddar. Crowder pea salad flecked with BentonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s country ham.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:147d8a7ef112e50eb1d24f5b9ec9fe272128ac73","amp;dn":"The+Third+Thursday+Community+Potluck+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"147d8a7ef112e50eb1d24f5b9ec9fe272128ac73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,125,138,126,241,18,229,14,177,210,79,91,158,201,254,39,33,40,172,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
