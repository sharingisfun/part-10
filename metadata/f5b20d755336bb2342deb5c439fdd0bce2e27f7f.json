In many ways, the double album was a recap of all the styles and sounds that made John a star. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is all over the map, beginning with the prog rock epic &quot;Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)&quot; and immediately careening into the balladry of &quot;Candle in the Wind.&quot; For the rest of the album, John leaps between popcraft (&quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;), ballads (&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;), hard rock (&quot;Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting&quot;), novelties (&quot;Jamaica Jerk-Off&quot;), Bernie Taupin's literary pretensions (&quot;The Ballad of Danny Bailey&quot;), and everything in between. Though its diversity is impressive, the album doesn't hold together very well. Even so, its individual moments are spectacular and the glitzy, crowd-pleasing showmanship that fuels the album pretty much defines what made Elton John a superstar in the early '70s. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images14.knack.be/images/resized/400/051/483/968/4/500_0_KEEP_RATIO_SHRINK_CENTER_FFFFFF/image/De-originele-cover-van-het-album-.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images14.knack.be/images/resized/400/051/483/968/4/500_0_KEEP_RATIO_SHRINK_CENTER_FFFFFF/image/De-originele-cover-van-het-album-.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nFuneral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding - 11:08\nCandle in the Wind - 3:50\nBennie &amp; The Jets - 5:23\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road - 3:13\nThis Song Has No Title - 2:23\nGrey Seal - 4:00\nJamaica Jerk - Off - 3:38\nI've Seen That Movie Too - 5:58\nSweet Painted Lady - 3:54\nThe Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34) - 4:23\nDirty Little Girl - 5:01\nAll the Girls Love Alice - 5:09\nYour Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock n'Roll) - 2:42\nSaturday Night's Alright (For Fighting) - 4:53\nRoy Rogers - 4:08\nSocial Disease - 3:43\nHarmony - 2:46","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b20d755336bb2342deb5c439fdd0bce2e27f7f","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Goodbye+Yellow+Brick+Road+%5BMp3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b20d755336bb2342deb5c439fdd0bce2e27f7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,178,13,117,83,54,187,35,66,222,181,196,57,253,208,188,226,226,127,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
