In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes a omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.\n\nWritten by Albert Camus\nRead by James Jenner\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n----------------------\nVisit us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd28ad3f2532ed879ec215da63167d6538f7759","amp;dn":"The+Plague+-+Albert+Camus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd28ad3f2532ed879ec215da63167d6538f7759","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,210,138,211,242,83,46,216,121,236,33,93,166,49,103,214,83,143,119,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
