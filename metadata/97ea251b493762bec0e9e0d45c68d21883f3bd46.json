Chris Connor brings an innovative repertoire with Sings Gentle Bossa Nova, opening the record with a Beatles song, Hard Day\\\\\\'s Night and keeps rolling with a nice repertoire with no Bossa Nova standards. This should please Loronixers as I got pleased when heard it today. Tracks include:\n\n01 - Hard Day\\\\\\'s Night\n02 - A Taste of Honey\n03 - Downtown\n04 - Feeling Good\n05 - Shadow of your Smile\n06 - Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)\n07 - Can\\\\\\'t Get Over the Bossa Nova\n08 - Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\n09 - Dear Heart\n10 - Baby, the Rain Must Fall\n11 - Stranger on the Shore\n12 - A Quiet Thing\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ea251b493762bec0e9e0d45c68d21883f3bd46","amp;dn":"Chris+Connor+-+Sings+Gentle+Bossa+Nova+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ea251b493762bec0e9e0d45c68d21883f3bd46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,234,37,27,73,55,98,190,192,233,224,212,92,104,210,24,131,243,189,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
