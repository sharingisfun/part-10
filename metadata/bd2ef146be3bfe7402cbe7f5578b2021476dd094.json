Pepper through Let It Be. Like the Red Album, the Blue Album contains a mixture of hits, including singles like &amp;quot;Lady Madonna,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Hey Jude,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Revolution&amp;quot; that were never included on an LP, plus important album tracks like &amp;quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A Day in the Life,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Come Together.&amp;quot; Like its predecessor, 1967-1970 misses several great songs, but the compilation nevertheless does capture the essence of the Beatles' later recordings. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd2ef146be3bfe7402cbe7f5578b2021476dd094","amp;dn":"Beatles+1967-1970+Blue+Album+%40160","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd2ef146be3bfe7402cbe7f5578b2021476dd094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,46,241,70,190,59,254,116,2,203,231,245,87,139,32,33,71,109,208,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
