(1960/2015)\n FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/96 kHz | Time - 32:17 minutes | 734 MB\nStudio Master, Official Digital Download | Artwork: Front cover\n\n Elvis Is Back! was the iconic pop star's first album after returning from his two-year military service in Germany. The 1960 album was the beginning of a major change in Elvis' music, moving closer to what would eventually become his well-known pop sound. Elvis Is Back! incorporated a mixture of genres, spanning rock, blues and pop.\n\n\n Although they have common recording origins, two of the three singles, &quot;It's Now or Never&quot; and &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight,&quot; were very quirky by the standards of Elvis songs at the time -- the former inspired by Elvis's admiration for Tony Martin's 1949 hit &quot;There's No Tomorrow,&quot; while the latter was recorded at the request of Col. Parker as a favor to his wife. They add to the diversity of sounds on this record, which shows a mature Elvis Presley. &quot;Dirty, Dirty Feeling&quot; and &quot;It Feels So Right&quot; showed he could still rock out and challenge authority and propriety, while &quot;Reconsider Baby&quot; and &quot;Like a Baby&quot; offer some of his best blues performances; but &quot;The Thrill of Your Love&quot; (a very gospel-tinged number), &quot;Soldier Boy,&quot; &quot;Girl of My Best Friend,&quot; and &quot;Girl Next Door Went a' Walking,&quot; also displayed the rich, deep vocalizing that would challenge critics' expectations of Elvis Presley playing rhythm guitar throughout. He also comes off better than on any of his other albums since arriving at RCA, as a musician as much as a &quot;star&quot; (he'd always had a lot more to say about running his sessions than the critics who loathed his RCA years indicated).  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Make Me Know It\n 02 - Fever\n 03 - The Girl of My Best Friend\n 04 - I Will Be Home Again\n 05 - Dirty, Dirty Feeling\n 06 - Thrill of Your Love\n 07 - Soldier Boy\n 08 - Such a Night\n 09 - It Feels So Right\n 10 - The Girl Next Door Went A'Walking\n 11 - Like a Baby\n 12 - Reconsider Baby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c561b9291fba21c1ab4ee5ba8528184d760347bf","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Elvis+Is+Back+%281960%29+%5B2015_Qobuz+24-96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c561b9291fba21c1ab4ee5ba8528184d760347bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,97,185,41,31,186,33,193,171,78,229,186,133,40,24,77,118,3,71,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
