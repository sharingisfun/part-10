Zhuo Ji Xian, an official of the Ministry of Revenue, is dispatched by order of the crown prince to deliver rations and fodder to the stricken region. While passing through the Jade Dragon Mountains, he and his men, along with the provisions, are seized by Lian Ni Chang, a female vigilante. Zhuo Ji Xian's son Zhuo Yi Hang, Wu Dang's head disciple, comes to his father's rescue, thereby becoming embroiled in the battle between the crown prince, infamous eunuch politician Wei Zhong Xian, and Lian Ni Chang. Although the two start off on the wrong foot, Zhuo Yi Hang and Lian Ni Chang are mutually attracted to each other and fall in love. However, misunderstandings occur that cause a rift in their relationship, and Lian Ni Chang's hair turns white overnight after believing that Zhuo Yi Hang has betrayed her. To restore Lian Ni Chang's former beauty and reunite with his lover, Zhuo Yi Hang travels to Mount Heaven in search of a legendary rare flower that blooms only once every 60 years. \n\nNicky Wu as Zhuo Yi Hang\nMa Su as Lian Ni Chang\nGuo Zhen Ni as He E Hua\nLouis Fan as Yue Ming Ke ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4361022d6b5938a29e60bf8e5854d0f8a70050a2","amp;dn":"The.Bride.With.White.Hair.E01-42.720p.HDTV.x264-NGB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4361022d6b5938a29e60bf8e5854d0f8a70050a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,97,2,45,107,89,56,162,158,96,191,142,88,84,208,248,167,0,80,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
