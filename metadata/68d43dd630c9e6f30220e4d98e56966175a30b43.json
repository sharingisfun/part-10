Readers will learn the basics of linear systems, types of nonlinearities and their effects, op-amp circuits, the high-gain analog filter-amplifier, and signal generation. The author uses system design examples to motivate theoretical explanations and covers system-level topics not found in most textbooks. Provides references for further study and problems at the end of each chapter Includes an appendix describing test equipment useful for analog and mixed-signal work Examines the basics of linear systems, types of nonlinearities and their effects, op-amp circuits, the high-gain analog filter-amplifier, and signal generation Comprehensive and detailed, Analog and Mixed-Signal Electronics is a great introduction to analog and mixed-signal electronics for EE undergraduates, advanced electronics students, and for those involved in computer engineering, biomedical engineering, computer science, and physics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68d43dd630c9e6f30220e4d98e56966175a30b43","amp;dn":"Analog+and+Mixed-Signal+Electronics+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68d43dd630c9e6f30220e4d98e56966175a30b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,212,61,214,48,201,230,243,2,32,228,217,142,86,150,97,117,163,11,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
