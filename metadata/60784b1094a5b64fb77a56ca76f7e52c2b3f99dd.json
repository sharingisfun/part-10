Films from American Graffiti to Hairspray and popular music from Sha Na Na to Michael Jackson shaped - and were shaped by - the complex social, political and cultural conditions of the Reagan Era. By closely examining the ways that &quot;the Fifties&quot; was remade and recalled, Back to the Fifties explores how cultural memories were fostered for a generation of teenagers trained by popular culture to rewind, record, recycle and replay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60784b1094a5b64fb77a56ca76f7e52c2b3f99dd","amp;dn":"Back+to+the+Fifties+-+1st+Edition+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60784b1094a5b64fb77a56ca76f7e52c2b3f99dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,120,75,16,148,165,182,79,183,122,86,202,118,247,229,44,43,63,153,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
