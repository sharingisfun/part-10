Operating a motorcycle safely in traffic requires special skills and knowledge. The Motorcycle Safety  Foundation (MSF) has made this manual available to help novice motorcyclists reduce their risk of having a crash. The manual conveys essential safe riding information and has been designed for use in licensing programs. While designed for the novice, all motorcyclists can benefit from the information thismanual contains. The original Motorcycle Operator Manual was developed by the National Public Services Research Institute (NPSRI) under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and within the terms of a cooperative agreement between NHTSA and the MSF. The manual and related tests were used in a multi-year study of improved motorcycle operator licensing procedures, conducted by the California Department of Motor Vehicles under contract to NHTSA.\n\nThe purpose of this manual is to educate riders and to help them avoid crashes while safely operating either a standard two-wheel motorcycle or a three-wheel motorcycle. This latest edition has undergone significant improvements, and contains new, more in-depth information, designed to:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t Guide riders in preparing to ride safely\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t Develop effective street strategies\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t Give riders more comprehensive understanding of safe group riding practices\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t Describe in detail best practices for carrying passengers and cargo In promoting improved  licensing programs, the MSF works closely with state licensing agencies. The Foundation has helped more than half the states in the nation adopt the Motorcycle Operator Manual for use in their\nlicensing systems. Improved licensing, along with high quality motorcycle rider education and  increased public awareness, has the potential to reduce crashes. Staff at the Foundation are available to assist state, private and governmental agencies in efforts to improve motorcycle safety.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e4671215fa3e004dcfcbc2751ecb0787844b38","amp;dn":"Motorcycle_Operators_Manual.pdf+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e4671215fa3e004dcfcbc2751ecb0787844b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,228,103,18,21,250,62,0,77,207,203,194,117,30,203,7,135,132,75,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
