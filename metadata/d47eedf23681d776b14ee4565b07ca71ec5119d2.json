This book portrays the heyday of the cowboy era which was between the end of the Civil War and the 1880s. The opening chapter contrasts the idealized version and real version of the American cowboy. Subsequent chapters describe the cattle barons, cowboy life in the bunkhouses and on the ranches, the Miles City, Montana roundup of 1886, a cattle drive on the Chisholm Trail in 1879, and the Kansas cattle towns (Abilene, Dodge City, Newton, Ellsworth, and Wichita). The final chapter describes the code of the West and how it applied to the cowboys, ranchers, sheepherders, horse thieves, and cattle rustlers. The numerous anecdotes in the narrative make for interesting reading. As with other books in this series, numerous photographs and illustrations supplement the text; several paintings by western artists Frederic Remington and Charles Russell are included. There are also several diagrams depicting the clothing and equipment of cowboys. In sum, author William H. Forbis and the editors of Time-Life books have produced an excellent book on one of the most iconic figures of the Old West","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d47eedf23681d776b14ee4565b07ca71ec5119d2","amp;dn":"The+Cowboys+%28Time-Life%2C+The+Old+West+Series%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d47eedf23681d776b14ee4565b07ca71ec5119d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,126,237,242,54,129,215,118,177,78,228,86,91,7,202,113,236,81,25,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
