The book offers comprehensive support on the units assessed by portfolio - from first aid and health and safety to specific chairside support procedures - as well as the four areas of the course tested by multiple choice questions: infection control, oral health assessment, dental radiography and oral health management.\n\nThis third edition of an established revision text has been substantially revised and restructured in line with the new qualification and reflects changes in the regulations and legislature affecting dentistry and dental workplaces, all of which have an effect on the daily role and working life of the dental nurse. It will be an invaluable guide for dental nurse trainees, qualified dental nurses and course providers.\n\n- Expanded and revised, with extensive coverage of the fifteen Diploma units\n- In full colour throughout with over 400 illustrations\n- Companion website with downloadable glossary and MCQs for revision and self-assessment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be442fc90c6d6715dcb1bdf5f0a80fc14313f8c","amp;dn":"Diploma+in+Dental+Nursing%2C+Level+3+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be442fc90c6d6715dcb1bdf5f0a80fc14313f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,228,66,252,144,198,214,113,93,203,27,223,95,10,128,252,20,49,63,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
