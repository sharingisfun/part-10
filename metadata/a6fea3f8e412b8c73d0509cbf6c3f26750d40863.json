Micro Adventurer was platform\nagnostic, and was successful for 17 issues before being unceremoniously\ncanned without warning. Also included in this collection is the book\n&quot;Spectrum Adventures&quot; by the same publisher.\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on the\nInternet. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and copying - this\nshould prove very useful for the adventure archivist who'd like to have\ntheir own local searchable archive. They look great on most PDF readers,\nincluding most capable mobile devices.\n\nIn keeping with the subject matter, Micro Adventurer had a fairly fixed\nand plain page layout, meaning the OCR process should be fairly\naccurate. However, as always it's a &quot;best effort&quot;, and some of the more\nwhacky layouts and fonts used will give mixed results.\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please Google RetroPDFs \nfor more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to\nRetroPDFs for their support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, Torch, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
