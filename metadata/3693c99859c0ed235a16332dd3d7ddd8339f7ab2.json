It was released in November 1967 \nand went on to reach #5 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming \na massive seller there in 1968, reaching #4 on the American charts. The album features the two \nsingles &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;.\n\nThe title of the album is a mondegreen based on an inside joke. Eric Clapton had been thinking of \nbuying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner \ncommented, &quot;it's got them Disraeli Gears&quot;, meaning to say &quot;derailleur gears,&quot; but instead alluding \nto 19th Century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and \ndecided that it should be the title of their next album. Had it not been for Mick's turn of phrase, \nthe album would simply have been titled &quot;Cream.&quot;\n\nThe original 11-track album was remastered in 1998, and then subsequently released as a two-disc \nDeluxe Edition in 2004.\n\nIn 2003 the album was ranked number 112 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums \nof All Time. VH1 also named it their 87th greatest album of all time in 2001.\n\n\n   1. Cream - Strange Brew                                    [02:50]\n   2.
