(1977)\n\n\nMp3 178 kbps\n\n\nBootsy Collins' debut solo album, Stretchin' Out in Bootsy's Rubber Band, was an extremely tough act to follow, but thankfully, there are no signs of a sophomore slump (either creatively or commercially) on his second album, Ahh...The Name Is Bootsy, Baby! Most P-funk addicts consider this 1977 LP essential listening, and it isn't hard to see why they feel that way. \n\nEverything on the album is excellent; that is true of up-tempo smokers like &quot;The Pinocchio Theory&quot; and the title song as well as slow, moody, eerie offerings such as &quot;What's a Telephone Bill?&quot; and &quot;Munchies for Your Love.&quot; The lyrics are consistently humorous and clever, the grooves are consistently infectious. You can think of Ahh...The Name Is Bootsy, Baby! as a meeting of the funk minds -- Collins produced this record with his mentor, George Clinton, who co-wrote all of the material. So Clinton  has a lot of input and gives Ahh...The Name Is Bootsy, Baby! the distinctive P-funk sound that Parliament/Funkadelic  was known for. \n\nBut at the same time, he encourages Collins' originality -- Bootsy's Rubber Band sounds like a Parliament/Funkadelic  spin-off (which is exactly what it was), but not a Parliament/Funkadelic  clone. Without question, Ahh...The Name Is Bootsy, Baby! is essential listening for lovers of hard 1970s funk.\n\n\n\n\n\n Track listing\n\nSide I / El Uno - A Friendly Boo\n\n   1. &quot;Ahh... the Name is Bootsy Baby&quot; (W.
