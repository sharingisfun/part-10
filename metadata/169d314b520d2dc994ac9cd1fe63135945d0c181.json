This 1959 Blue Note date features the pianist in full stride with a quintet that includes trumpeter Blue Mitchell and saxophonist Junior Cook, two fellow proponents of funky hard bop. The gospel and R&amp;B influence in Silver's approach is evident as finger-snapping grooves support bouncing melodies that bubble and pop with every chorus. As the title suggests, this music is a celebratory fanfare that washes away the hardships of everyday life.\n\nThe explosive title track opens the session with a bang as the group burns through the changes with tight precision and plenty of spirit. The jazzier &quot;The St. Vitus Dance&quot; is a swinging trio cut with hints of an Ellington influence among the bopping lines of Silver's solo. The most well known tunes here are the lush ballad &quot;Peace,&quot; featuring outstanding work by Mitchell, and the classic &quot;Sister Sadie,&quot; one of the most recorded Silver compositions in the jazz repertoire. Other highlights of this exemplary session are the bebop-flavored &quot;Break City&quot; and the aptly titled ballad &quot;Melancholy Mood.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.&quot;Blowin' the Blues Away&quot; - 4:44\n2.&quot;The St. Vitus Dance&quot; - 4:09\n3.&quot;Break City&quot; - 4:57\n4.&quot;Peace&quot; - 6:02\n5.&quot;Sister Sadie&quot; - 6:19\n6.&quot;The Baghdad Blues&quot; - 4:52\n7.&quot;Melancholy Mood&quot; - 7:10\n8.&quot;How Did It Happen&quot; - 4:41 Bonus track on CD\n\nRecorded August 29 (tracks 1, 6), August 30 (#3, 4, 5, 8 ) &amp; September 13 (#2, 7), 1959.\n\nPersonnel\n\nHorace Silver - piano\nBlue Mitchell - trumpet (tracks 1, 3-6 &amp; 8 )\nJunior Cook - tenor saxophone (tracks 1, 3-6 &amp; 8 )\nGene Taylor - bass\nLouis Hayes - drums[/size]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:169d314b520d2dc994ac9cd1fe63135945d0c181","amp;dn":"Horace+Silver+Blowin%5C%27+the+Blues+Away+%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"169d314b520d2dc994ac9cd1fe63135945d0c181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,157,49,75,82,13,45,201,148,172,156,209,254,99,19,89,69,208,193,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
