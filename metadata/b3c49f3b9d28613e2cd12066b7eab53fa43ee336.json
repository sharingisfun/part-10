As relevant today as when it was first published, this is a landmark set of essays on humanistic \n\neconomics. This 25th anniversary edition brings Schumacher's ideas into focus for the end-of-the-century by adding commentaries by contemporary thinkers who have been influenced \n\nby Schumacher. They analyze the impact of his philosophy on current political and economic thought. Small is Beautiful is the classic of common-sense economics upon which many \n\nrecent trends in our society are founded. This is economics from the heart rather than from just the bottom line.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nE. F. SHUMACHER (1911-1977) was a Rhodes Scholar in economics and the head of planning at the British Coal Board. He was also the president of the Soil Association and the \n\nfounder of the Intermediate Technology Development Group. \n\n-----------------\n\nFavorite of S.
