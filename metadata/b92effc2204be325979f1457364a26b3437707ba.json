Using authentic materials and figures selected from scientific texts, students will improve their reading, writing and speaking skills in a context relevant to their specialist studies.\n\nIn addition to covering linguistic features specific to scientific and technical purposes, this book also presents review and practice activities in common problem areas of general English usage. The material for the textbook has been developed and tested in classes at the English Department of the University of Stuttgart over several semesters, and it addresses most of the problems English-language learners confront.\n\nSince the book is designed as both textbook and workbook, it is suitable for classroom use and for self-study. It contains extensive monolingual glossaries, tasks, grammar reviews and word studies directly related to the texts and figures. Solutions are offered in the back of the book.\n\nThe textbook offers sufficient material for a one-semester language class of about 14 sessions. Subjects, grammar reviews and word studies can also be studied independently.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b92effc2204be325979f1457364a26b3437707ba","amp;dn":"Iris+Eisenbach+-+English+for+Materials+Science+and+Engineering.p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b92effc2204be325979f1457364a26b3437707ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,46,255,194,32,75,227,37,151,159,20,87,54,74,38,179,67,119,7,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
