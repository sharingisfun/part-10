Set on the magical Massachusetts island, True Love introduces characters from a new generation of Montgomery-Taggerts, the beloved family from DeverauxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic novels.\n\nJust as Alix Madsen is finishing up architectural school, Adelaide Kingsley dies and wills her, for one year, the use of a charming nineteenth-century Nantucket house. The elderly womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship to the Madsen family is a mystery to the spirited AlixÃ¢â‚¬â€fresh from a romantic breakupÃ¢â‚¬â€but for reasons of her own Alix accepts the quirky bequest, in part because it gives her time to plan her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s storybook wedding.\n\nBut unseen forces move behind the scenes, creaking Kingsley HouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ancient floorboards. It seems that Adelaide Kingsley had a rather specific task for Alix: to solve the strange disappearance of one of the Kingsley women, Valentina, more than two hundred years ago. If that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t troubling enough, Alix must deal with the arrogant (and extremely good-looking) architect Jared Montgomery, who is living in the propertyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guesthouse.\n\nUnbeknown to Alix, Jared has been charged with looking after her while she lives on the islandÃ¢â‚¬â€an easy task for him, considering the undeniable chemistry between the two. But Jared harbors secrets of his own, which, if revealed, may drive a wedge between the pair.\n\nWith a glorious Nantucket wedding on the horizon, sparks fly, and the ghosts of the past begin to reveal themselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€some of them literally. Finding their lives inextricably entwined with the turbulent fortunes of their ancestors, Alix and Jared discover that only by righting the wrongs of the past can they hope to be together.\n\nAdvance praise for True Love\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Jude DeverauxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nantucket Brides series will sweep you away. A beautiful island, a sexy man, and plenty of secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€this is a wonderful writer at her best.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Susan Mallery, New York Times bestselling author of Three Sisters\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A new Jude Deveraux novel means a very late night turning the pages straight through to the delicious end.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Susan Elizabeth Phillips, New York Times bestselling author of The Great Escape\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A novel about star-crossed love, life, death and reincarnation . . . a romantic story of love so deep it survives centuries.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus Reviews","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39062eae8bd693a03132c9e023b10c8f138937e0","amp;dn":"True+Love+-+Jude+Deveraux.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39062eae8bd693a03132c9e023b10c8f138937e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,6,46,174,139,214,147,160,49,50,201,224,35,177,12,143,19,137,55,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
