The original Mandarin version was released onto VHS format in the 1980s and is now out of print.\n This masterpiece of wushu martial arts, featuring Grandmaster Carter Wong - whose original training was in Shaolin but also has black belts in Taekwondo, Hapkido, Karate and Muay Thai (having trained under the greatest masters of the respective disciplines).\nHe was also trained in Wudang and has pioneered an all new form of Tai-chi that incorporates various disciplines, and who has trained innumerable martial arts champions, as well as being the representative of kick boxing in the People's Republic of China.\n He is currently the martial arts instructor of over one hundred martial arts schools worldwide. He has been inducted into The Kung Fu Hall of Fame and can truly be considered one of the greatest martial arts movie of all time.\n  He puts martial arts movies from Hollywood to shame by making Aikido practitioner, Steven Seagull, and World Karate Champions, Jean Claude Van Dame and Chuck Norris, appear like ill-trained, fledging amateurs, whose worthlessness is self-evident in their Hollywood flicks.\n\n The movie revolves around the innumerable failed attempts by the successors of a martial arts school whose Grand Master was killed while attempting to defend an old master martial arts - who  made a vow to Buddha not to engage in any form of combat but, nevertheless, finds himself being forced to fight the notorious members of a martial arts school seeking to gain control of the People's Republic.\n Seeking revenge on their masters behalf only to find each successor being killed in combat by the invincible Carter Wong and the members of his school until a Buddhist nun and a Taoist priest provides them with the requisite training to defeat the bad guys. \n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/BMPqdZT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/BMPqdZT&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjacker, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
