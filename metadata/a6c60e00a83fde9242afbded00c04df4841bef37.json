In The Blue Zones Solution, readers can be inspired by the specific stories of the people, foods, and routines of our healthy elders; understand the role community, family, and naturally healthy habits can play in improving our diet and health; and learn the exact foodsâ€”including the 50 superfoods of longevity and dozens of recipes adapted for Western tastes and marketsâ€”that offer delicious ways to eat your way to optimum health. Throughout the book are lifestyle recommendations, checklists, and stories to help you create your own personal Blue Zones solution. Readers will learn and apply the 80/20 rule, the plant slant diet, social aspects of eating that lead to weight loss and great health naturally, cultivating your &quot;tribe&quot; of friends and family, and your greater purpose as part of your daily routine. \r\n \r\nFilled with moving personal stories, delicious recipes, checklists, and useful tips that will transform any home into a miniature blue zone, The Blue Zones Solution is the ultimate blueprint for a healthy, happy life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c60e00a83fde9242afbded00c04df4841bef37","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Zones+Solution+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6c60e00a83fde9242afbded00c04df4841bef37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,198,14,0,168,63,222,146,66,175,189,237,0,192,77,244,132,27,239,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
