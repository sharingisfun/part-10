Chapter One introduces the reader to evolution and early human triumphs, from making the first tools to the discovery of fire to the invention of the wheel and use of metal. The author highlights the ways of life and achievements of some of the ancient civilisations and outlines why they faded away.\n\nAlong with the colourful unfolding of historical details, interesting facts emerge as one goes from one civilisation to the other.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What games did Egyptian children play?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How, according to the first laws laid down by the Babylonian king Hammurabi, should a person stealing cattle or sheep, or an ass or a pig or a goat, be punished?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What was special about the streets, the houses and the bathrooms in Harappa?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Where did the Nazca make giant outlines of animals?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Why did the Minoans play the dangerous sport called bull leaping?\n\nHistory is not a mere list of dates; in the pages of this book, the ancient civilisations leap to life through the vivid illustrations and photographs, carefully selected, some appearing here for the first time. Additional information is presented in text boxes, and supporting maps help match early locations with present geographical positions.\n\nSpark History: Ancient Civilisations is an excellent tool for teachers who want to go beyond the textbook and take children on an exciting journey of discovery of ancient civilisations.\n\n\nCONTENTS\n1.
