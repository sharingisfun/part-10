Songs like &quot;Nobody Has to Know&quot; feature Josh Haden's smoky vocals and moody arrangements and continue Spain's compellingly melancholy direction.\nForget all those best albums of '99 lists you've read elsewhere this is the finest album of the year. If you like your music with a melancholy ache that coils around you like the whispering ghost of a lost lover thenthis is for you. It conjures up the spirit of Will Oldham, Leonard Cohen or even a mimimalist Tindersticks but underlying Josh Haden's tender, broken voice is an understated and gorgeous jazz texture - heartbreaking lullabyes for the darkness closing. And they seem to be Swedish!.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1f82ac9cdc185712fc4b4cbeb1f5f1377dfd38","amp;dn":"Spain+-+She+Haunts+My+Dreams+%5B1999%5D++%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1f82ac9cdc185712fc4b4cbeb1f5f1377dfd38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,31,130,172,156,220,24,87,18,252,75,76,190,177,245,241,55,125,253,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
