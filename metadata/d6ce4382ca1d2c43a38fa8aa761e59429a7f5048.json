Dance of the Reptiles collects the best of HiaasenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Miami Herald columns, which lay bare the stories--large and small--that demonstrate anew that truth is far stranger than fiction. \n\nHiaasen offers his commentaryÃ¢â‚¬â€indignant, disbelieving, sometimes righteously angry, and frequently hilariousÃ¢â‚¬â€on burning issues like animal welfare, polluted rivers, and the broken criminal justice system as well as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Bernie Madoff's trial, and the shenanigans of the recent presidential elections. Whether or not you have read Carl Hiaasen before, you are in for a wild ride.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ce4382ca1d2c43a38fa8aa761e59429a7f5048","amp;dn":"Dance+of+the+Reptiles+by+Carl+Hiaasen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ce4382ca1d2c43a38fa8aa761e59429a7f5048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,206,67,130,202,29,44,67,163,143,168,170,118,30,89,66,154,127,80,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
