That set has been restructured\nand made available in single volumes because it will be easier to update as upgrades become available.\n\nThe collection makes many of the older compilations unnecessary, the other tracks can be found on\nofficial releases and the singles collected by Kazo on his Black Vinyl series.\n\nCATCH A FIRE STUDIO SESSIONS DynamicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - recorded Oct 1972\n1.

I have used selections from the dedhd69 upload Ã¢â‚¬ËœBurninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ alternate version as this is the best source for\nthese tracks\n\nNATTY DREAD STUDIO SESSIONS Harry JÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - recorded early 1974\n9. Iron Lion Zion dub - 1992 remix (3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢57) Chris Blackwell dubs\nxx Rebel Music shorter version as 7&quot; but fades early -\n10.

The instrumental is not Talking Blues but is still titled as such in the discography\n\nTracks marked xx are excluded they are noted as being very similar to official releases and / or have poorer\nquality.\nThem Belly Full short mix (01-12) has better quality than the similar black vinyl source and has therefore\nbeen included\n\nFakes:\nThere are a more than a few fake fan made demos circulating so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worthwhile to be aware of them. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not particularly\nagainst fake mixes if they have been done well and I have included one above, Lively Dub Yourself.\n\nLively Up Yourself is one of the most commonly used tracks for fan made remixes and dubs etc. because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the\ncirculating multi track masters, the remaining are listed below:\n\nLively Up Yourself dub mix (8'35) fake, long mix with phaser effect -\nSo Jah Seh dub (4Ã¢â‚¬â„¢29) Ultra rarities\nRebel Music long dub (6Ã¢â‚¬â„¢43) Ultra rarities\nRevolution echo mix (4Ã¢â‚¬â„¢03) Authentic demos\n\nThese notes compiled by J2B September 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a07a347e2b3ea1273bbb7122881b6c331871e72","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+-+REBEL+MUSIC+VOL.+2%3A+EARLY+SESSIONS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a07a347e2b3ea1273bbb7122881b6c331871e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,7,163,71,226,179,234,18,115,187,183,18,40,129,182,195,49,135,30,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
