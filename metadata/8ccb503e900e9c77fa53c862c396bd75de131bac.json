A technical proof is included and shows the average quantizer of the encoding, which is as low as 3.xx. This proofs also that bitrate is meaingless. Quantizers are a much better quality factor.\n\ncredit NeDiVx &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ccb503e900e9c77fa53c862c396bd75de131bac","amp;dn":"New.Moon.DVDRip.XviD-NeDiVx+%28The+Twilight+Saga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ccb503e900e9c77fa53c862c396bd75de131bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,203,80,62,144,14,156,119,250,83,200,98,195,150,189,117,222,19,27,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
