Soon his former nemesis Masha emerges from the political underground to gift him with a thumbdrive containing a Wikileaks-style cable-dump of hard evidence of corporate and governmental perfidy. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incendiary stuffÃ¢â‚¬â€and if Masha goes missing, Marcus is supposed to release it to the world. Then Marcus sees Masha being kidnapped by the same government agents who detained and tortured Marcus years earlier.\n\nMarcus can leak the archive Masha gave himÃ¢â‚¬â€but he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t admit to being the leaker, because that will cost his employer the election. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surrounded by friends who remember what he did a few years ago and regard him as a hacker hero. He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even attend a demonstration without being dragged onstage and handed a mike. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not at all sure that just dumping the archive onto the Internet, before heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone through its millions of words, is the right thing to do.\n\nMeanwhile, people are beginning to shadow him, people who look like theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re used to inflicting pain until they get the answers they want.\n\nFast-moving, passionate, and as current as next week, Homeland is every bit the equal of Little BrotherÃ¢â‚¬â€a paean to activism, to courage, to the drive to make the world a better place","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a3c65ff4df2579a151651bac7ff7ea75c342100","amp;dn":"Cory+Doctorow+-+Homeland+%28Little+Brother+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a3c65ff4df2579a151651bac7ff7ea75c342100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,60,101,255,77,242,87,154,21,22,81,186,199,255,126,167,92,52,33,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
