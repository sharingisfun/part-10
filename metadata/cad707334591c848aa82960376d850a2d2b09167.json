The band was, and still is, based in Haugesund, a small town at the westcoast of Norway. The intention and the goal as musicians has always been to try to capture the atmosphere and the feeling there is to Norse mythology, combined with the intensity of heavy metal music. As the first flyers for &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot; so clearly stated; &quot;Out of the wastes of the Northern hemisphere, comes the most epic &amp; atmospheric Viking Metal. Charged with the power of MjÃƒÂ¸lner. Enchanted by the mysticism of the land of Thule.&quot; A very strong statement, but it is the code that Einherjer still live by. Therefore we label Einherjer's music as Viking Metal.\nTHE NAME...\nThe name Einherjer is taken from the Norse mythology, Einherjer is a vikings life after death. When a viking was slained in battle, he was brought up to Valhalla by the Valkyries, for then to join the army of Einherjers and help the Gods in their clash against the Giants in the age of Ragnarok.  \n...........\nNorrÃƒÂ¸n (which means Norse) opens with the epic Ã¢â‚¬Å“NorrÃƒÂ¸n KraftÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It has a grand scope of themes, both classical and metal. Leader/front man Frode Glesnes has a gnarly vocie that reminds me a lot of the early black metal vocalists. His crusty throated missives cut through the music in an impressive manner. The music has equal parts doom, thrash and epic metal all at once. The sing-a-long parts about half way through gave me chills. After a folk-ish interlude the track comes back with full power. Ã¢â‚¬Å“NalfgarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has musical war like imagry in the form of military drums and bombastic riffs. This certainly doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound like a band from almost twenty years ago. They sound envigorated and you can hear where they have influenced the modern bands like the more raucous songs by AGALLOCH. Buzzsaw guitars are intercut with symphonic flourishes by Gerhard Storsund who plays keybords and drums. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alu Alu LaukarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ threw me for a bit of a loop. Even though I think they were going for a marching to war type of theme, the beat comes off like disco music and kills an otherwise potentially good song. Luckily it goes by quickly at under three minutes. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Varden BrenneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a much better effort full of great beat and cool chords changes. Ã¢â‚¬Å“MalmtingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shifts back and forth between a more modern black metal sound (no triggers, but the same beats), thrash and another classic groove laden song. Glesnes is masterful in melding dirparite parts together in a cohesive manner, owing much to his expereince. The final track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Balledem Om BifrostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ballad of BifrostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tells the story of the famed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rainbow BridgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ between the nine worlds of norse mythology. Musically it takes the form of a blackened folk death ballad that never drops down to a whisper nor a true all out roar, but has many emotionally rousing moments. The album is really solid except for the one mistep track so if viking metal is your thing, pick up this album.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nUlvar - drums, keyboards\nGrimar - vocals, guitars\nAksel HerlÃƒÂ¸e - guitars\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nDragons Of The North (1996)\nOdin Owns Ye All (1998)\nNorwegian Native Art (2000)\nBlot (2003)\nNorrÃƒÂ¸n (2011)\nAv Oss, For Oss (2014)\n\n\n\nAv Oss, For Oss (2014)\n\n\n\n01.
