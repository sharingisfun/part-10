Also, it is well applied in several major areas such as water splitting, bacterial inactivation, and pollutants elimination, which is a possible solution to energy shortage and environmental issues. The fundamental knowledge and the frontier research progress in typical photocatalytic materials, such as TiO2-based and non-TiO2-based photocatalysts, are included in this book. Methods to improve the photocatalytic efficiency and to provide a hint for the rational design of the new photocatalysts are covered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e95571a82a8aaebf71bb1464eb482963d17f36","amp;dn":"Semiconductor+Photocatalysis+-+Materials%2C+Mechanisms+and+Applica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60e95571a82a8aaebf71bb1464eb482963d17f36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,233,85,113,168,42,138,174,191,113,187,20,100,235,72,41,99,209,127,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
