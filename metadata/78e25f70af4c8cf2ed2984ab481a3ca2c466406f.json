Son House: My Black Mama part 2\n\n\n\n\nArcola's second double CD release features Son House, a true child of the Mississippi Delta, born in Coahoma County, 1902. Once a part-time preacher, in performance he balanced secular blues with religious messages.\n\nThe first CD begins with Son's unsurpassed 1968 Seattle concert, including song introductions, Son's thoughts on life and the blues, and descriptions of how he came to write each selection. According to one reviewer this performance is the best of his recorded powers after his rediscovery in 1964. And indeed, a comparison between this concert and the various 1965 recordings show that it took a few years for Son to get back into shape. Consequently, Son House is truly in his best form here on Arcola.\n\nThe second CD starts with Son's 1930 recording of My Black Mama Pt. 1 and continues with my 1968 interview where he describes his early life and musical influences, and how he made his way with Willie Brown, Charlie Patton and the pianist Louise Johnson to Grafton, Wisconsin. There Son made his first recordings with Art Laibly of Paramount Records. The interview continues with Son's stories about those three and his other companions of the time, Rube Lacy and Robert Johnson. Son describes how he and Willie Brown took Robert under their wings, and got him out of his nest and eventually into another one that killed him. Interspersed with the interview are songs from each of these musical colleagues and the disk concludes with Son's 1930 recording of My Black Mama Pt. 2.\n\nExtensive liner notes are written by Dick Waterman and Bob Groom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78e25f70af4c8cf2ed2984ab481a3ca2c466406f","amp;dn":"Son+House+-+Son+House+in+Seattle+1968+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78e25f70af4c8cf2ed2984ab481a3ca2c466406f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,226,95,112,175,76,140,242,237,41,132,171,72,26,60,162,196,102,64,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
