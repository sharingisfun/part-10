There's no other sound quite like it, and there's no other band like Konono No. 1, the assemblage of Bazombo musicians, dancers, and singers from Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) that makes the likembe the center of their sound. It's something of an accidental update on Bazombo trance music, and it's thrillingly unique stuff, a torrent of kinetic sound that straddles the line between the traditional and the avant-garde. The likembe is commonly known in the West as a thumb piano, and there are variations of the instrument in different cultures across Africa-- perhaps the most well-known is the mbira, which is used across Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. The instrument has a pinging tone that is practically designed by nature to sound awesome with a bit of amp fuzz on it &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/19208-congotronics?artist_title=19208-congotronics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/19208-congotronics?artist_title=19208-congotronics&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks\n1- Lufuala Ndonga\n2- Masikulu\n3- Kule Kule\n4- Ungudi Wele Wele\n5- Paradiso\n6- Kule Kule Reprise\n7- Mama Liza\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e5f9157796bae7e0996eb5e5999a04716ddfdae","amp;dn":"Konono+No.+1+-+Congotronics+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e5f9157796bae7e0996eb5e5999a04716ddfdae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,95,145,87,121,107,174,126,9,150,235,94,89,153,160,71,22,221,253,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
