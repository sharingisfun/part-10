Their career began modestly, with a pair of albums inspired by the positive-minded likes of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. After adding Fergie, the group's pop instincts reached full flight. Ignited by the Top Ten hit 'Where Is the Love?' and the Grammy-winning party anthem 'Let's Get It Started,' the group scored three multi-platinum albums in 2003's Elephunk, 2005's Monkey Business, and 2009's The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies). While still connected to hip-hop, the group's sound turned toward dance-pop -- a savvy move that transformed them from a cult act into a mainstream phenomenon. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t22729-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.84% CDDA &amp; 99.89% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Boom Boom Pow\n02.Don't Phunk With My Heart\n03.Let's Get It Started\n04.My Humps\n05.Shut Up\n06.I Gotta Feeling\n07.Pump It\n08.Mama Hey\n09.Dont Lie\n10.Mas Que Nada\n11.Like That\n12.That's The Joint\n13.Gone Going\n14.Request Line\n15.Where Is The Love?\n16.Union\n17.The APL Song\n18.Fallin' Up\n19.Weekends\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Meet Me Halfway\n02.Where Ya Wanna Go\n03.Rock That Body\n04.Sexy\n05.Hot\n06.Feel It\n07.Hands Up\n08.Shut The Phunk Up\n09.Rap Song\n10.Love Won't Wait\n11.Labor Day (It's A Holiday)\n12.Bridging The Gaps\n13.The Way U Make Me Feel\n14.Latin Girls\n15.Bringing It Back\n16.Smells Like Funk\n17.Tell Your Mama Come\n18.Que Dices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It!****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35bd530c51f12fecf146a03aed2a0605e71cc826","amp;dn":"The+Black+Eyed+Peas+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35bd530c51f12fecf146a03aed2a0605e71cc826","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,189,83,12,81,241,47,236,241,70,160,58,237,42,6,5,231,28,200,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
