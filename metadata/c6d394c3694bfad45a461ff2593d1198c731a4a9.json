Blackmon brings to light one of the most shameful chapters in American historyÃ¢â‚¬â€an Ã¢â‚¬Å“Age of NeoslaveryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that thrived from the aftermath of the Civil War through the dawn of World War II.Using a vast record of original documents and personal narratives, Douglas A. Blackmon unearths the lost stories of slaves and their descendants who journeyed into freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation and then back into the shadow of involuntary servitude shortly thereafter. By turns moving, sobering, and shocking, this unprecedented account reveals the stories of those who fought unsuccessfully against the re-emergence of human labor trafficking, the companies that profited most from neoslavery, and the insidious legacy of racism that reverberates today.\n\n2009 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction Winner!\n\nJanet Maslin\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦relentless and fascinating. It exposes what has been a mostly unexplored aspect of American history (though there have been dissertations and a few books from academic presses). It creates a broad racial, economic, cultural and political backdrop for events that have haunted Mr. Blackmon and will now haunt us all. And it need not exaggerate the hellish details of intense racial strife. The torment that Mr. Blackmon catalogs is, if anything, understated here. But it loudly and stunningly speaks for itself.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The New York Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d394c3694bfad45a461ff2593d1198c731a4a9","amp;dn":"Douglas+A.+Blackmon+-+Slavery+by+Another+Name+%5B128%5D+2009+Pulitze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d394c3694bfad45a461ff2593d1198c731a4a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,211,148,195,105,75,250,212,90,70,31,242,89,61,17,152,199,49,164,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
