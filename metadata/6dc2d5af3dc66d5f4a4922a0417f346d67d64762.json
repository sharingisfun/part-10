But the Looney Tunes thinks of a plan to find a way to escape slavery on Moron Mountain. And Bugs Bunny decided to defend themselves by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Then the Nerdlucks uses their strange powers to steal the talent of five NBA stars such as Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, and Shawn Bradley which they&amp;#039;ll ultimately transform themselves into the tallest and muscular Monstars. It&amp;#039;s up to Michael Jordan to help the Looney Tunes play a basketball game vs. the Monstars.
