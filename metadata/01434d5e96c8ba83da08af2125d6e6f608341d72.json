Once, Witch Song controlled everything from the winds to the shifting of the seasons-but not anymore. All the Witches are gone, taken captive by a traitor. All but Brusenna. As the echo of their songs fade, the traitor grows stronger. Now she is coming for Brusenna. Her guardian has sworn to protect her, but even he can't stop the Dark Witch. Somehow, Brusenna has to succeed where every other Witch has failed. Find the traitor. Fight her. Defeat her. Because if Brusenna doesn't, there won't be anything left to save.\n\nWitch Born (Witch Song #2) by Amber Argyle (September 5th 2012)\n\nBrusenna thought it was finished. She defeated the Dark Witch, saving the Haven Witches from imprisonment and death. She found love and a place to belong. She was wrong. Haven is not the sanctuary it appears to be. Even love is in danger of slipping away like water through cupped hands. Some things can't be saved. A new threat merges with the old as the Witches' dark history begins to catch up with them. Only Brusenna knows the extent of the danger and how to stop it, though doing so might cost her everything. Including her life. Will Brusenna be required to make the ultimate sacrifice?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01434d5e96c8ba83da08af2125d6e6f608341d72","amp;dn":"Witch+Song+Series+%281-2%29+by+Amber+Argyle+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01434d5e96c8ba83da08af2125d6e6f608341d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,67,77,94,150,200,186,131,218,8,175,33,37,214,230,246,8,52,29,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
