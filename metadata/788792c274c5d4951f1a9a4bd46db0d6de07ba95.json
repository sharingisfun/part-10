Ã¢â‚¬Å“Network&quot; in a broader sense includes wired and wireless communication networks, on-chip networks, queueing networks, and so on. There are extensions for real-time simulation, network emulation, alternative programming languages (Java, C#), database integration, SystemC integration, and several other functions.\n\nLearning OMNeT++ is an easy-to-follow, hands-on book that walks you through the steps necessary to get a Network Simulation up and running as quickly as possible. This book uses pre-existing OMNeT++ libraries to prevent you from needing to reinvent the wheel so that you can implement your simulations with ease.\n\nOMNeT++ is a solution for creating accurate and modular Network Simulations. It will take you through all the steps necessary to allow you to create, run, and analyze your own Network Simulations.\n\nYou will model complex network simulations, and once you've covered the basics you will then learn how to make your simulations scalable and configurable so they can become truly accurate and useful.\n\nThe booksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s practical approach will teach you how to create and run Network Simulations using OMNeT++, as well as how to use pre-existing OMNeT++ libraries.\n\nApproach\n\nThe book uses a concise and practical approach to take you through all the steps necessary to create, run, and analyze your own Network Simulations.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is ideal for anyone wishing to quickly get to grips with Network Simulation whether you're an expert in networks or just a beginner. It is perfect for all network engineers and administrators who wish to emulate networks using OMNet++ as a preparation for building the actual network.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:788792c274c5d4951f1a9a4bd46db0d6de07ba95","amp;dn":"Learning+OMNeT%2B%2B+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"788792c274c5d4951f1a9a4bd46db0d6de07ba95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,135,146,194,116,197,212,149,31,26,154,75,212,109,176,214,222,7,186,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
