For use with 2nd edition AD&amp;D.\n\nJust mount the file and install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAD&amp;D Core Rules 2.0 on CD-ROM is a great tool package for serious AD&amp;D enthusiasts, players and DMs alike. The high quality of this new release is a great relief after the poor showing of the first version.\n\nProgram tools include complete text of nine key rule books, a character generator, improved dungeon, city and wilderness mapmakers, dice roller software, and a DM's toolkit with programs for automatically generating encounters, treasure troves, spells, NPCs, and more.\n\nMapping is provided through two different programs, the Map Maker and the Campaign Mapper. The former quickly creates City, Dungeon, and Overland maps, with neatly detailed symbols and some randomized variety in repetitive, placed features such as trees, houses, and mountains. The Campaign Mapper is much more complex, and will be very familiar to users of ProFantasy's Campaign Cartographer. In this program, maps are built in multiple layers and encounter data can be linked to the maps. Grids toggle on and off in either program; printing is available in both black-and-white and color. Both programs are miles beyond the original Core Rules map generator and an invaluable aid to the DM tired-to-death of graph paper and smudges.\n\nThe highly-detailed character generator can be set for either Core or &quot;PlayerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Option&quot; rules, and quickly creates fully-equipped PCs and any level of NPCs complete with spells, skills, and, if desired, random names (some strange but interesting results, a feature probably of more use to the DM). Twelve methods of characteristic generation are provided, from straight &quot;youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re-stuck-with-these-stats&quot; to the manual entry of numbers. An optional ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½cityÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ interface provides ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½buildingsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ to visit for creating all of the characterÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s various skills and items.\n\nNine on-line books are included: Monstrous Manual, PlayerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Handbook, Dungeon Master Guide, Arms &amp; Equipment Guide, Tome of Magic, Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns, and the three PlayerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Option books: Combat &amp; Tactics, Skills &amp; Powers, and Spells &amp; Magic. No pictures, all text, but quite a treasure trove for the price of the program, considering the price of acquiring physical copies of all of the books.\n\nEncounters and monsters (lair and wandering), treasures, and NPCs are quickly set up by the DM toolkit. The installed database is customizable for house rules, letting DMs add their own monsters, character races, equipment, skills/proficiencies, magic items, racial abilities, powers, and spells, a flexibility sorely lacking in the previous version.\n\nThe value of this CD-ROM for the DM is enormous. Several of the various areas of the program can be run simultaneously, a great convenience for writing an adventure (the cyber equivalent of spreading out your books). For a pressing game deadline, reference sheets can be quickly printed, fast dice ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rolled,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and NPCs and encounters swiftly generated, with the creation of maps probably taking the most time. With all this, all the DM needs is a good idea!\n\n--Sharon Daugherty\n--------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061616bd7e2360ebe0709a7fd77797873e0296f4","amp;dn":"AD%26D+Core+Rules+2.0+%2B+Expansion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061616bd7e2360ebe0709a7fd77797873e0296f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,22,22,189,126,35,96,235,224,112,154,127,215,119,151,135,62,2,150,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
