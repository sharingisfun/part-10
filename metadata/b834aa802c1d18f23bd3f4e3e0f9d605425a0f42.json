Also, you will notice that my sync of Another Brick In The Wall 1 is much more \nin-line with what is going on. Great video quality as it's a Blue Ray rip synced with 320K MP3's. \nEnjoy and Please Seed!\nBill","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b834aa802c1d18f23bd3f4e3e0f9d605425a0f42","amp;dn":"Alice+On+The+Wall+%28Pink+FLoyd%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b834aa802c1d18f23bd3f4e3e0f9d605425a0f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,52,170,128,44,29,24,242,59,211,244,227,224,249,214,5,66,90,15,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
