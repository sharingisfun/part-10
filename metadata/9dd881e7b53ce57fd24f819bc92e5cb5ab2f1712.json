Aside from talent, writers need a strategy for distinguishing their efforts from countless others. (No, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use pink paper.) Paul B. Brown has been an author on a dozen books with sales totaling more than 2 million copies. So you could say he knows what it takes. In Getting Published, Brown offers a straightforward approach to test-marketing book ideas, creating strong proposals, reaching the right editors and agent, and more. Equally important, he provides inside tips for how to become an integral part of the publisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marketing and sales efforts. The book also gives pointers on nontraditional arrangements such as self- and subsidy-based publishing. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many valuable tools include sample contract language, a fully annotated book proposal, and exercises to help authors identify what they may be doing right and wrong. With abundant humor and unparalleled insight, Brown debunks the myths and misconceptions in favor of trustworthy and effective advice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd881e7b53ce57fd24f819bc92e5cb5ab2f1712","amp;dn":"Publishing+Confidential%3A+Land+a+Nonfiction+Book+Deal+-+Paul+B.+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd881e7b53ce57fd24f819bc92e5cb5ab2f1712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,216,129,231,181,60,229,127,210,79,129,155,201,46,92,181,171,47,23,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
