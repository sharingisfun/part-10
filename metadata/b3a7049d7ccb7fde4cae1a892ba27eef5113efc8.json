Shot on 16mm at Fort Worth, Texas in 1978, the film has been upgraded to high definition with a 5.1 audio track. It includes a Sir Mick Jagger interview filmed in August 2011 where he introduces the concert and offers an insight into its significance in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. Featuring many Stones classics including: Honky Tonk Woman, Tumbling Dice, Brown Sugar, Jumpin Jack Flash, Miss You and Beast of Burden. (rollingstones.com)\n\nThe Rolling Stones 1978 tour of the USA in support of that year's Some Girls album is considered by fans to be one of their very best. The tour followed immediately on the release of the Some Girls album and by the time the band arrived in Texas in mid-July the album had hit the No.1 spot on the US charts. The tour took a back to basics approach, with the band and their music very much at the forefront and little or no elaborate staging. Filmed at the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 18th, 1978, this concert is typical of the tour with the Rolling Stones delivering a raw, energetic performance in front of a crowd who are clearly loving the show.
