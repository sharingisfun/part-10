I'll see 100 people downloading and then activity goes to zero once they all get what they want.  It's unfortunate!  But, I seed my torrents 24/7, unless I'm doing a reboot or we experience a power outage.  If you start downloading one of my posts and it comes to a halt, don't give up on it, I'll be back online as soon as 'the internet God' allows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c870a32f0cda975d62bd5de095319ad288e5244d","amp;dn":"Wild+Hearts+%282006%29+Eng.+%5BHallmark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c870a32f0cda975d62bd5de095319ad288e5244d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,112,163,47,12,218,151,93,98,189,93,224,149,49,154,210,136,229,36,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
