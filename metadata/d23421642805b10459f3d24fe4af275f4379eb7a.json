It is full of the sensitive nuance that french impressionistic music requires. I had this recording on LP, and am ecstatic to find it is now available on CD. I had bought another full CD recording by another highly regarded pianist which is not of the same caliber of playing as the Casadesus. I cannot do without the Casadesus recording!
