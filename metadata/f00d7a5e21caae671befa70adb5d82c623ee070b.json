Surpassing nine hours of viewing, News is a strange total work of art, rare in our century. The idea that foments the screening of this film is, in many ways, to analyze our the status of the political in our present condition. The film will be shown in different sessions throughout the course of five weeks as to introduce a visual experience that is complex as well as demanding from its audience. Under the heading &quot;Critical material on Eisenstein Project&quot;, the viewers will find secondary material on the film in order to facilitate the viewing and engage in critical discussion. At first sight one could read KlugeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film as a reworking of  Soviet director Sergei EisensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s project of filming, vis-ÃƒÂ -vis James JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ulysses, into reality of the twentieth-first century. At another level, KlugeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film, like GodardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Historie(s) du Cinema, is the total culmination, not only of his work, but of modern cinema as such. Monumental in scope, and avant-garde in its form, KlugeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cinematic essay speaks to our contemporary world today more than ever. It is with pleasure that that we delve into the world of Kluge, along with this platform, in hopes that will enhance the critical viewing experience and understanding of cinema. \n\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00d7a5e21caae671befa70adb5d82c623ee070b","amp;dn":"News+From+Ideological+Antiquity+Marx+Eisenstein+The+Capital+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00d7a5e21caae671befa70adb5d82c623ee070b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,13,122,94,33,202,174,103,27,239,167,10,219,93,130,198,35,238,7,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
