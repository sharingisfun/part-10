When Teddy Leikman, the homosexual son of a politically connected department-store magnate, is murdered, detective Joe Leland (Frank Sinatra) is sent in to investigate. Leland drags in Teddy's psychotic former roommate Felix Tesla (Tony Musante) and forces a confession out of him; for his work on the case Leland gets a promotion, which troubles him. Afterwards, Norma MacIver (Jacqueline Bisset), the widow of a well-heeled accountant, comes to see Leland. Her husband was killed after falling off the grandstand at a racetrack -- but Norma thinks he was pushed. She asks Leland to investigate her husband's death. Reopening the case, Leland discovers that the police are opposed to him scratching around any further, and after an attempt on his life, he uncovers some startling evidence that may connect the two deaths.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062883/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062883/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-14458&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-14458&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x288\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1091 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,22 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd81d27fa0a64b68b42d1390c5aec0df17473fc6","amp;dn":"The+Detective+%281968%29+Frank+Sinatra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd81d27fa0a64b68b42d1390c5aec0df17473fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,129,210,127,160,166,75,104,180,45,19,144,197,174,192,223,23,71,63,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
