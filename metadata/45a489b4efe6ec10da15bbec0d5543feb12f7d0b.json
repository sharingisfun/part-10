While the networks continued to chase the lowest common denominator, a wave of new shows, first on premium cable channels like HBO and then basic cable networks like FX and AMC, dramatically stretched televisionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative inventiveness, emotional resonance, and artistic ambition. No longer necessarily concerned with creating always-likable characters, plots that wrapped up neatly every episode, or subjects that were deemed safe and appropriate, shows such as The Wire, The Sopranos, Mad Men, Deadwood, The Shield, and more tackled issues of life and death, love and sexuality, addiction, race, violence, and existential boredom. Just as the Big Novel had in the 1960s and the subversive films of New Hollywood had in 1970s, television shows became the place to go to see stories of the triumph and betrayals of the American Dream at the beginning of the twenty-first century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a489b4efe6ec10da15bbec0d5543feb12f7d0b","amp;dn":"Difficult+Men%3A+Behind+the+Scenes+of+a+Creative+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a489b4efe6ec10da15bbec0d5543feb12f7d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,164,137,180,239,230,236,16,218,21,187,236,13,85,67,254,177,47,125,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
