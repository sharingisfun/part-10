Consumed by thoughts of vengeance, he is consoled only by thoughts of the beautiful, dangerous Madeline. He is also the greatest thief in all of Ile-Rien...\n\nUnder cover of darkness on the streets of the gaslit city, he assumes the guise of a master criminal, stealing jewels from wealthy nobles to finance his quest for vengeance: the murder of Count Montesq. Montesq orchestrated the wrongful execution of Nicholas's beloved godfather Edouard on false charges of necromancy, the art of divination through communion with spirits of the dead, a practice long outlawed in the kingdom of Ile-Rien.\n\nBut now Nicholas's murderous mission is being interrupted by a series of eerie, unexplainable, even fatal events. Someone with tremendous magical powers is opposing him. Children vanish, corpses assume the visage of real people, mortal spells are cast, and traces of a necromantic power that hasn't been used for centuries are found. And when a spiritualist unwittingly leads Nicholas to a decrepit old house, the truly monstrous nature of his peril finally emerges in harrowing detail.\n\nNicholas and his band of criminals and disgraced officers must confront and destroy an ancient and awesome evil rising from its hideous darkness to conquer all. Even the help of Ile-Rien's greatest sorcerer may not be sufficient, for Nicholas faces a woefully mismatched battle with unthinkable horrors in store for the loser. This book is set in the same world as The Wizard Hunters and The Element of Fire but can be read on its own. \n\n\n\n\n&quot;One of the best new writers the field has to offer.&quot; - C.J. Cherryh\n\n*&quot;A seamless blend of fantasy, history, magic, and mystery. This is the kind of world that you come to believe exists, somewhere: a place you leave only reluctantly.&quot; - Sean Russell\n\n*&quot;The vivid setting of a gas-lit city, equal parts decadence and elegance, would eclipse lesser characters than these. Character construction and setting are so deftly interwoven with the swiftly moving plot that the prose literally swept me away. The reader should be warned in advance, it is difficult to close the covers of this book.&quot;\n- Robin Hobb\n\n*&quot;Wells never fails to intrigue, amuse and fascinate with her imaginative world, wonderful characters, and expert grasp of narrative style. I highly recommend anything by Martha Wells -- and I wish she wrote faster!&quot; - Jennifer Roberson\n\n\n\n\n\nFormats - EPUB,MOBI,LIT,PDF,HTML","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92def84bca42ec1f6c2eb5d186ef178948f94cd5","amp;dn":"Martha+Wells+-The+Death+of+the+Necromancer+%28FANTASY%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92def84bca42ec1f6c2eb5d186ef178948f94cd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,222,248,75,202,66,236,31,108,46,181,209,134,239,23,137,72,249,76,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
