For some years I have only two issues, for some I have three issues... Because I have painstakingly hunted for them all over the web. In some cases I have edited them, cleaned up watermarks or dark blotches etc... Not in all, though. \nIncluded is the book &quot;The Best of Interweave Crochet&quot; (edited by Marcy Smith), including 20 unique crochet patterns. \n\nP.S. I'm in Europe, and I can only seed at night. So don't start complaining if you don't get it immediately.
