But suffice to say the Stiff Upper Lip delivers the hard-rocking' goods on every track, just like Highway to Hell, Back in Black, and High Voltage. It suffers from none of the muddy production problems that plagued their post-Mutt Lange albums, in fact it sounds better than any of their albums, in terms of production, except the remastered Back in Black. AC/DC's previous two albums (Razor's Edge &amp; Ballbreaker), to me anyways, signifigantly improved over the majority of mid-late 80's material (Fly on the Wall, Blow Up Your Video), but SUL absolutely demolishes The Razor's Edge and Ballbreaker in terms of power, riffage, and Brian fixed-up vocals sound better than he has in a long, long time. Every song has that indefinable &quot;timeless&quot; rock sound that pours out from a lot of their late 70's material. Each song has you wondering &quot;How can they not release this as a single?&quot; Songs alternate between Back In Black evil rock (Safe in New York City, House of Jazz, Damned(my fav) and Powerage-style funky blues licks (Meltdown, Hold Me Back, Can't Stand Still). You absolutely cannot go wrong with record. Easily on par with your favorite AC/DC album, and easily better than the rest. \n\nby Morgan\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Stiff Upper Lip.wma           \n02 - Meltdown.wma                  \n03 - House Of Jazz.wma             \n04 - Hold Me Back.wma              \n05 - Safe In New York City.wma     \n06 - Can't Stand Still.wma         \n07 - Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll.wma  \n08 - Satellite Blues.wma           \n09 - Damned.wma                    \n10 - Come And Get It.wma           \n11 - All Screwed Up.wma            \n12 - Give It Up.wma                \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6c921a4aa3e67444e7d1f1cf4ae5da669ae5bd","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Stiff+Upper+Lip+%282000%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6c921a4aa3e67444e7d1f1cf4ae5da669ae5bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,108,146,26,74,163,230,116,68,231,209,241,207,74,229,218,102,154,229,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
