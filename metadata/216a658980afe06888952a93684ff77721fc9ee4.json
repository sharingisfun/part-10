McCartney was attacked for his virtues -- for his melodicism and his \ndomesticity, along with his desire to form a real touring band following the \nBeatles. None of these were celebrated at the time, but he moved many, many \nrecords and sold countless concert tickets, which only hardened opposition \ntoward him. But, in retrospect, McCartney's albums make for the most fascinating \nbody of work among any of the ex-Beatles, and really among any of his peers. \nYes, there were pitfalls among the heights, but that's part of what makes his \ncareer so fascinating -- each record is distinctive, and even if the songs \nthemselves are shallow, at least lyrically, the melodic skill and studio savvy \nbehind each are hard not to admire. This may require a bit of conversion, and if \nyou're not up to trudging through his individual works, even such masterworks as \nRam (truly the roots of homemade pop), the double-disc set Wingspan is ideal. \nMcCartney has had a number of career overviews before, including such seemingly \ncomprehensive discs as All the Best, but those were plagued by vaguely haphazard \nsequencing. This is nearly perfectly executed, dividing McCartney's career \nbetween the &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;history,&quot; with the latter being devoted to album tracks \nthat are acknowledged classics, yet never were singles. Now, it's true that this \nisn't completely comprehensive -- some will notice that superstar duets with \nStevie Wonder and Michael Jackson are missing, and others will wonder where such \nterrific latter-day singles as &quot;Press&quot; are or why such charting hits as &quot;So Bad&quot; \nare bypassed, or why album tracks like &quot;Ballroom Dancing&quot; are absent -- but \nnothing has come as close to capturing the quirky brilliance of McCartney's solo \ncareer, how it balanced whimsical pop with unabashedly sentimental romantic \nballads, piledriving rockers, and anything in between. And what makes Wingspan \nso impressive is how the &quot;History&quot; disc fills in the gaps that &quot;Hits&quot; leaves, \nwhether it's on the tremendous &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; (one of the very best songs he \never wrote), the charming &quot;Junk,&quot; the clever &quot;Take It Away,&quot; or such absolutely \nstunning miniatures as &quot;Heart of the Country,&quot; an effortless folk-pop tune that \nranks among his very best songs. That's why Wingspan isn't just a good hits \ncollection -- it's a convincing argument that McCartney's solo recordings are a \nrich, idiosyncratic body of work of their own merits. Ram, Red Rose Speedway, \nand London Town all have their merits, but if you need to be converted, this is \nwhere to start. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             SOME WIKIPEDIA INFO\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWingspan: Hits and History is a greatest hits compilation album by Paul \nMcCartney featuring material spanning his first solo album McCartney in 1970 to \nthe 1984 Give My Regards To Broad Street movie soundtrack. This set is \nofficially credited to Paul McCartney, although the bulk of the music included \nwas performed by McCartney's former band Wings.\n\nAmerican and British editions of the album vary slightly, as the UK edition \ncontains the studio version of &quot;Coming Up,&quot; while the U.S. edition contains \n&quot;Coming Up (Live at Glasgow),&quot; which had reached number one on the Billboard \nsingles chart. The Japanese version of the album also includes &quot;Eat at Home,&quot; \nwhich had been issued as a 1971 single in the non-English-speaking world, as a \nbonus cut on the &quot;Hits&quot; disc.\n\nHistory\n\nMcCartney was involved in 15 albums during this period: five solo albums; one \nalbum with his wife Linda; and nine albums with Wings (including a greatest hits \ncompilation). Wingspan features songs from each of those albums, as well as a \nfew singles that had not been included on Wings Greatest.\n\nWings was active from 1971 to 1980, but this set also includes material from \nMcCartney's albums from earlier (1970-71) and later (1980-84) years. It does \nnot, however, include any of McCartney's well-known collaborations with Stevie \nWonder or Michael Jackson, which took place during the latter period.\n\nThe album is separated into two distinct sets: a &quot;Hits&quot; component which \nhighlights commercially successful material, while &quot;History&quot; showcases less \ngenerally known McCartney favourites from the same period. On the U.S. release, \n14 of the 18 songs on &quot;Hits&quot; were performed by Wings, but only 9 of the 22 songs \non &quot;History&quot; are by Wings.\n\nReleased in 2001 in conjunction with a prime time TV documentary simply called \nWingspan, the associated soundtrack was a commercial success, reaching #5 in the \nUK and #2 in the US. The album was eventually certified Double Platinum by RIAA. \nA DVD release of the documentary, which dealt with McCartney's relationship with \nLinda Eastman and their eventual marriage, the traumatic final year of the \nBeatles' career and his own role in their breakup, and the story of Wings' \nformation and career through the 1970s toward their final dissolution in 1980, \nwas produced by Mary McCartney, who also interviewed her father in the film.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          SOME ALLMUSIC REVIEWS, ON INDIVIDUAL TRACKS CONTAINED HERE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANOTHER DAY     by Scott Janovitz\n\nPaul McCartney's first solo single, 1971's &quot;Another Day,&quot; remains among his best \npost- Beatles work. As a legal maneuver to keep royalties coming into his \nhousehold while his own affairs with Apple and Northern Songs were tied up, the \nalways business savvy McCartney credited his wife, Linda McCartney, with co-\nwriting his songs. While for the most part this was simply a loophole, on \n&quot;Another Day&quot; Linda earns her pay, delivering her finest supporting performance \non any of her husband's records. Of course, the show is Paul's, and the raw \nmaterial here is undeniably of the highest quality. &quot;Another Day&quot; features the \nbest of what he is capable of: an incredibly catchy melody; an organic, acoustic \narrangement; complex and well-orchestrated harmonies; and an active, melodic \nbass line. And again, lyrically, this type of song is where he shines. It's a \npicture of seemingly average life, about a woman who gets up everyday and goes \nto work. But McCartney is able to expose the darkness underneath the surface of \nthis life, describing her hopes and disappointments and, ultimately, her \nbreakdown. It is one of McCartney's gifts, like a pop Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, to \nbe able to match the music to the change in lyrical tone within the same song, \nmaking it sound seamless and natural. &quot;Another Day&quot; bounces along with the \ncheery banality of the woman's routine before making sharp detours into menacing \nterritory as he describes her sadness and her highs and lows as &quot;the man of her \ndreams&quot; appears. But he apparently uses her and leaves her again in despair. \nDramatic swells and releases mark this event: &quot;And he comes, and he stays/But he \nleaves the next day/So sad.&quot; This is also the point where Linda's contribution \ncomes to the fore. Her harmony on this latter line matches Paul's lead vocal in \npresence, and the passionate swell in volume is truly the selling point of the \nsong. She sings well throughout the song (parts no doubt arranged by Paul), but \nperhaps the importance of her part here is not just her complete commitment to \nit, but also the fact of the female voice being identifiable with the song's \nsubject character. Paul pleads, &quot;Ah, stay/Don't stand her up,&quot; but it's Linda, \nbecoming the character and doubling the plea, who injects reality into the \nmoment. The tone of her voice as it changes from a falsetto background voice to \na prominent, full voice is distressingly and perfectly sad. The culmination of \nthe song is the woman's breakdown: &quot;As she posts another letter to the sound of \nfive/People gather round her as she finds it hard to stay alive.&quot; McCartney then \nleaves this scene to refrain. Just the hint of it is enough to convey the \ndespair of her life. Earlier, he indicates this impending breakdown in a \nmirroring verse as he says, &quot;At the office where the papers grow she takes a \nbreak/Drinks another coffee as she finds it hard to stay awake.&quot; This betrays \nthe foreignness of this office setting to McCartney himself (&quot;at the office \nwhere the papers grow&quot;) and thus, to the character he's created, who has \ndifficulty surviving there when it's all she lives for (since the rest of her \nlife is so unrewarding). However, the final verse is a repetition of the first \nverse, describing her getting up and going to work again, indicating that it's a \ncycle she will not break out of. Nothing has changed for her, and therefore, \nnothing will. \n\n\n\nGOODNIGHT TONIGHT \tby Donald A. Guarisco\n\nWith this 1979 hit, Wings joined fellow British rockers like the Kinks and the \nRolling Stones in experimenting with the disco trend on &quot;Goodnight Tonight.&quot; \nSome rock fans turned up their nose at it as a result but a close listen to the \nsong reveals it is not the sell-out that these fans claimed. In fact, &quot;Goodnight \nTonight&quot; is a good example of Paul McCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to incorporate the sounds \nof the day into his usual blend of pop and rock elements without ever losing his \nunique musical personality. The lyrics have a low-key charm not usually present \nin disco songs as they present a would-be romeo trying to talk his date out of \ngoing home before he can work his magic: &quot;DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be too tired for love/DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t let \nit end/DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say goodnight to love/It will never happen again/DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say it, \nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say it/Say anything but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say goodnight tonight.&quot; The music has a \nsurprisingly jazzy edge to it as it pairs elegant verses full of wistful melodic \ntwists to a chorus that delivers its hooks in a swinging style. WingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ recording \nof &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot; into a fusion of rock and disco elements: steady drumming \nand a percolating bass line give it a dance-friendly flair but these elements \nare balanced with some hard-rocking twin guitar work (including an amusing solo \nbreak where two guitars ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“answerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ each other in call-and-response fashion) and \nmellow electric piano work. McCartney keeps this sonic brew afloat with a slick \nvocal that affects a silky croon on the verses but shifts into a bluesy wail for \nthe chorus. The result had enough of a solid beat for the discos but enough pop \nand rock elements to please non-disco fans and it became a top-five hit as a \nresult. McCartney also produced a 12-inch version of &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot; \nespecially for dance clubs. Today, the song remains a favorite because its solid \nhooks and adventurous arrangement have made it strong enough to outlive the \ndisco backlash. \n\n\nHELEN WHEELS \tby Donald A. Guarisco\n\nMan critics and pop fans wrote Paul McCartney off as a mere purveyor of sugary \npop in the 1970's due to hits like &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; but a close look at his \nwork from this era reveals he also recorded several bracing rockers. One of the \nbest was &quot;Helen Wheels,&quot; a raucous 1973 single that was added to American \npressings of Band On The Run. The lyrics were inspired by Paul McCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s land \nrover and pay homage to Chuck BerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s travelling-themed rockers like &quot;The \nPromised Land&quot; as they describe a trip from Scotland to England on the M-6 \nmotorway: &quot;M6, south down to Liverpool/Where they play the west coast \nsound/Sailor Sam, he came from Birmingham/But he never will be found.&quot; This \nnarrative is pumped up by an exciting melody that builds from swinging, \nbreathlessly paced verses into a shout-along chorus that underlines the phrase \n&quot;Helen - hell on wheels&quot; with go-for-broke enthusiasm. McCartney raises the \nexcitement level even higher on his recording of &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; with a gutsy \narrangement that marries snarling electric guitars to a shuffling, ska-styled \nbeat. McCartney wails over the top of this driving sound with an abandon \nreminiscent of his early Beatles, adding the ideal final touch to make it a fun \nrocker. As a result, &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; became a top-10 hit for McCartney. It did \nsimarly well around the world and stands alongside &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;JuniorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Farm&quot; as \none of McCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest rockers from this era. \n\n\nBLUEBIRD  \tby Donald A. Guarisco\n\nMany pop fans consider Band On The Run to be the gem of Paul McCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo \ncatalog because of the high amount of craftsmanship that distinguishes each of \nits songs. Indeed, even the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s simplest tracks benefit from the intensive \namount of work put into the album - a case in point is &quot;Bluebird,&quot; a simple bit \nof acoustic pop that overflows with hooks thanks to a slick arrangement. The \nlyrics are simple but charming as the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narrator compares his powers of \nromance to that of the title bird: &quot;Late at night when the wind is still/IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll \ncome flying through your door/And youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll know what love is for/IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a bluebird.&quot; \nThe music backing up this light scenario is surprisingly sophisticated, pairing \nhypnotically drawn-out verses that spiral down in a jazzy style with a \npercolating chorus built around the rhythmic chant of &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a bluebird.&quot; Paul \nMcCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recording of &quot;Bluebird&quot; mixes some island music stylings into its \njazzy pop sound: The instrumental break is dominated by a smoky saxophone solo \nbut gently strummed acoustic guitars and calypso-styled percussion anchor the \ntrack, giving it the feel of a beach campfire singalong. McCartney tops it off \nwith a charmingly crooned lead vocal that is supported by hypnotic harmonies \nfrom Linda McCartney and Denny Laine on the chant-heavy chorus. The end result \nis a delightful, breezy pop tune that provides a gentle respite from the harder \nrocking numbers on the first side of Band On The Run. &quot;Bluebird&quot; remains a \nfavorite with McCartney fans today thanks to its gentle but insidiously catchy \nstyle. \n\n\nJUNK \tby Donald A. Guarisco\n\nPaul McCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-titled solo debut was taken to task during its initial \nrelease by pop critics and fans alike for lacking the slick studio polish that \nhad come to define his work with the Beatles. Time has been kind to its low-key, \nhomespun sound, which suits the intimate feeling of its songs nicely. One of its \nfinest moments is &quot;Junk,&quot; a melancholy charmer of a ballad that has become a \ncult favorite with McCartney fans. McCartney penned this song while he was still \nin the Beatles, around the time they underwent their short-lived retreat with \nthe Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The lyrics capture the wistful mood of a junkyard by \nalternating cheeky descriptions of its contents (&quot;Parachutes, army \nboots/Sleeping bags for two/Sentimental jamboree&quot;) with a chorus that poignantly \nillustrates what its like for the items in the junkyard (&quot;Buy, buy, says the \nsign in the shop window/why, why, says the junk in the yard&quot;). McCartney draws \nout the wistful tone of this narrative by pairing gentle verses that lope along \nin soulful but slightly sad style with a chorus that is built on an ascending-\nnote hook that accentuates its emotional ache. Paul McCartney gives the song a \nhushed, intimate sound on his recording of &quot;Junk,&quot; anchoring it on one of his \ntypically fluid and melodic bass lines as he layers on gentle acoustic guitars \nand bells to create an elegant but subtle sound. McCartney tops it off with a \nsoftly crooned vocal that captures its wistful mood nicely. &quot;Junk&quot; was never \nissued as a single but remains a favorite with Paul McCartney fans and has been \ncovered by Cilla Black and John Denver. McCartney also later reworked &quot;Junk&quot; in \nan orchestral style for his Working Classical album. \n\n\nVENUS AND MARS/ROCK SHOW  \tby Donald A. Guarisco\n\nThis energetic song started Venus And Mars off with a bang thanks to its \ncombination of fiery rock and a crafty arrangement. The lyrics evoke the mood of \nexcitement that comes with attending a rock concert in a colorful style that \nnamedrops WingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ frequent touring haunts: &quot;If thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a rock show at the \nConcertgebow/They got long hair at the Madison Square/YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got rock and roll \nat the Hollywood Bowl/WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be there, ooh yeah.&quot; The music starts in a gentle \nfolky style to underline the fanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pre-show perspective of the &quot;Venus And Mars&quot; \npart but quickly moves into a gutsier style for the &quot;Rock Show&quot; part that grafts \nhard-swinging verses to a punchy chorus that utilizes a staccato, sing-along \nstyle. Paul McCartney gives this twisty tune the kind of big-production \narrangement it needs on his recording of &quot;Venus And Mars/Rock Show&quot;: it starts \noff with soft acoustic guitars and airy synthesizer lines that soon give way to \na stomping rocker full of surging guitar riffs and pounding piano licks. \nMcCartney also works in a fun bridge where the band affects a reggae beat while \nhe camps it up in a mock- Marc Bolan &quot;glam&quot; style and a trick ending where the \nsong gives way to a synth-drenched instrumental coda. All these bits of ear \ncandy helped &quot;Venus And Mars/Rock Show&quot; become a #12 hit on the pop charts and a \nfavored set opener on McCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mid-1970's Wings tours. It remains a favorite \nwith McCartney fans and an excellent example of his skills as an arranger. \n\n\nTUG OF WAR  \tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nCut and released in 1982, the title track from the Tug of War album opened the \nset with a clear message, that being the muse hadn't left Paul McCartney; it \napparently had only been sleeping. Utilizing the game listed in the title, Macca \nuses this metaphor brilliantly to illustrate the struggle between people, both \nlovers and strangers. It's pure poetry, and one of his finest lyrics since his \nBeatles efforts. Musically, the song begins with a simple, folk-based melody, \nsomewhat reminiscent of his Rubber Soul and Band on the Run days. Morphing into \na military cadence, the song builds with intense emotion and force, culminating \nin a fabulous fade out. A brilliant beginning to a brilliant album. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216a658980afe06888952a93684ff77721fc9ee4","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+-+Wingspan+%28Hits+%26+History%29+%282CD%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BReP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216a658980afe06888952a93684ff77721fc9ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,106,101,137,128,175,224,104,136,149,42,147,104,79,247,119,33,252,158,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
