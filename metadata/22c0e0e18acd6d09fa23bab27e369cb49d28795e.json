Football. The beautiful game. The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular sport goes by many names, but for decades, fans have agreed on one thing: the greatest player of all time was PelÃƒÂ©. Now the legendary star, ambassador, and humanitarian shares a global vision for what soccer can accomplish. Now he shares his story, his experience, and his insights on the game for the very first time.\n\nBefore Messi, before Ronaldo, before Beckham, there was Edson Arantes do NascimentoÃ¢â‚¬â€known simply as PelÃƒÂ©. A national treasure, he created pure magic with his accomplishments on the field: an unprecedented three World Cup championships and the all-time scoring record, with 1,283 goals in his twenty year career.\n\nNow, with the World Cup returning after more than sixty years to BrazilÃ¢â‚¬â€the country often credited with perfecting the sportÃ¢â‚¬â€soccer has a unique opportunity to encourage change on a global level. And as the tournamentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official ambassador, PelÃƒÂ© is ready to be the face of progress.\n\nFor the first time ever PelÃƒÂ© explores the recent history of the game and provides new insights into soccerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role connecting and galvanizing players around the world. He has traveled the world as the global ambassador for soccer and in support of charitable organizations such as Unicef, promoting the positive influences soccer can have to transform young men and women, struggling communities, even entire nations. In groundbreaking detail and with unparalleled openness, he shares his most inspiring experiences, heartwarming stories and hard-won wisdom, and he puts the game in perspective.\n\nThis is PelÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy, his way of passing on everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned and inspiring a new generation. In Why Soccer Matters, PelÃƒÂ© details his ambitious goals for the future of the sport and, by extension, the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c0e0e18acd6d09fa23bab27e369cb49d28795e","amp;dn":"Why+Soccer+Matters+-+Pele","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c0e0e18acd6d09fa23bab27e369cb49d28795e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,192,224,225,138,205,109,9,250,35,186,178,126,54,156,180,157,40,121,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
