Groomed to be a tennis champion by his moody and demanding father, by the age of twenty-two Agassi had won the first of his eight grand slams and achieved wealth, celebrity, and the gameâ€™s highest honors. But as he reveals in this searching autobiography, off the court he was often unhappy and confused, unfulfilled by his great achievements in a sport he had come to resent. Agassi writes candidly about his early success and his uncomfortable relationship with fame, his marriage to Brooke Shields, his growing interest in philanthropy, andâ€”described in haunting, point-by-point detailâ€”the highs and lows of his celebrated career.\r\n\r\nFrom Booklist\r\n\r\nAgassi has always had a tortured look in his eyes on the tennis court. In 1992, when he burst onto the world sports stage by winning the Grand Slam at Wimbledon, he looked like a deer in headlights. Nobody seemed more surprised and upset by his big win that day than he did. For good reason, too. Agassi hated tennis. This is the biggest revelation in his very revealing autobiography. Agassi has hated tennis from early childhood, finding it extremely lonely out on the court. But he didnâ€™t have a choice about playing the game because his father drove him to become a champion, like it or not. Mike Agassi, a former Golden Gloves fighter who never made it professionally, decided that his son would become a champion tennis player. In militaristic fashion, Mike pushed seven-year-old Andre to practice relentlessly until the young boy was exhausted and in pain. He also arranged for Andre, age 13, to attend a tennis camp where he was expected to pull weeds and clean toilets. The culmination of all of this parental pushing came when Andre began winning as an adult. But it didnâ€™t make him happy. Within this framework, Agassiâ€™s other disclosures make sense. He had a troubled marriage to Brooke Shields that didnâ€™t last. He developed a drug problem that sabotaged his career. He was insecure about everything. Only when Andre met tennis star Steffi Graf (whom he eventually married) did things begin to change. Readers will definitely cheer when Andre finally makes peace with the game he once hated and learns to enjoy it. --Jerry Eberle\r\n\r\nReview\r\n\r\nA New York Times Notable Book and a Forbes, San Francisco Chronicle, and Washington Post Best Book of the Year\r\n\r\nâ€œAgassi may have just penned one of the best sports autobiographies of all time. Checkâ€”itâ€™s one of the better memoirs out there, period. . . . An unvarnished, at times inspiring story [told] in an arresting, muscular style. . . . Agassiâ€™s memoir is just as entrancing as his tennis game.â€\r\nâ€”Time\r\n\r\nâ€œFascinating. . . . Inspiring. . . . Open describes Agassiâ€™s personal odyssey with brio and unvarnished candor. . . . [Agassiâ€™s] career-comeback tale is inspiring but even more so is another Open storyline. It could be called: The punk grows up. . . . Countless athletes start charitable foundations, but frequently the organizations are just tax shelters or PR stunts. For Agassi helping others has instead become his lifeâ€™s calling. . . . Open is a superb memoir, but it hardly closes the books on an extraordinary life.â€\r\nâ€”The Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\nâ€œHonest in a way that such books seldom are. . . . An uncommonly well-written sports memoir. . . . Bracingly devoid of triumphalist homily, Agassiâ€™s is one of the most passionately anti-sports books ever written by a superstar athlete.â€\r\nâ€”The New York Times\r\n\r\nâ€œNot your typical jock-autobio fare. This literate and absorbing book is, as the title baldly states, Agassiâ€™s confessional, a wrenching chronicle of his lifelong search for identity and serenity, on and off the court.â€\r\nâ€”Los Angeles Times\r\n\r\nâ€œThe writing here is exceptional. It is canâ€™t-put-down good.â€\r\nâ€”Sports Illustrated\r\n\r\nâ€œAn honest, substantive, insightful autobiography. . . . The bulk of this extraordinary book vividly recounts a lost childhood, a Dickensian adolescence, and a chaotic struggle in adulthood to establish an identity. . . . While not without excitement, Agassiâ€™s comeback to No. 1 is less uplifting than his sheer survival, his emotional resilience, and his good humor in the face of the luckless cards he was often dealt.â€\r\nâ€”The Washington Post\r\n\r\nâ€œThe most revealing, literate, and toes-stompingly honest sports autobiography in historyâ€\r\nâ€”Rick Reilly, ESPN\r\n\r\nâ€œMuch more than a drug confessionâ€”Agassi weaves a fascinating tale of professional tennis and personal adversity. . . . His tale shows that success is measured both on and off the court.â€\r\nâ€”New York Post\r\n\r\nâ€œNot only has Agassi bared his soul like few professional athletes ever have, heâ€™s done it with a flair and force that most professional writers canâ€™t even pull off.â€\r\nâ€”Entertainment Weekly\r\n\r\nâ€œ[A] heartfelt memoir . . . Agassiâ€™s style is open, all right, and his book, like so many of his tennis games, is a clear winner.â€\r\nâ€”O, The Oprah Magazine\r\n\r\nâ€œHard-won self-knowledge irradiates almost every page of Open. . . . Not just a first-rate sports memoir but a genuine bildungsroman, darkly funny yet also anguished and soulful. It confirms what Agassiâ€™s admirers sensed from the outset, that this showboat . . . was not clamoring for attention but rather conducting a struggle to wrest some semblance of selfhood from the sport that threatened to devour him.â€\r\nâ€”The New York Times Book Review\r\n\r\nâ€œA riveting and reflective memoir by a man who rose to the top of his sportâ€”despite hating it.â€\r\nâ€”San Francisco Chronicle\r\n\r\nâ€œCelebrity tell-alls have rarely been this honest and this interesting.â€\r\nâ€”Baltimore Sun\r\n\r\nâ€œA vivid portrait of the internal battle faced in some measure by every athlete.â€\r\nâ€”Bloomberg News\r\n\r\nâ€œArticulate. . . . Expertly rendered.â€\r\nâ€”The Morning News (Boston)\r\n\r\nâ€œRefreshingly candid. . . . This lively, revealing, and entertaining book is certain to roil the tennis world and make a big splash beyond.â€\r\nâ€”Publishers Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716bf6e32188ef766990a1637baa98866f50975a","amp;dn":"Open+-+Andre+Agassi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716bf6e32188ef766990a1637baa98866f50975a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,107,246,227,33,136,239,118,105,144,161,99,123,170,152,134,111,80,151,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
