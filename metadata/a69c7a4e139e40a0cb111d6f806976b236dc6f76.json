Its members describe the\n   band as being of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´The new wave of American Heavy metalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ and are firmly in the\n   post-thrash metalcore slot in their music style.\n\n   Chimaira was formed in 1998, composing itself of Mark Hunter (Vocals), Jason\n   Hager (Guitar), Rob Arnold (Guitar), Jim LaMarca (Bass), Andols Herrick\n   (Drums) and Chris Spicuzza (Keyboards and Electronics). Their first EP, This\n   Present Darkness, was released on January 11, 2000, on East Coast Empire\n   records. This EP featured a few songs that were later re-recorded for their\n   major label release on Roadrunner Records, entitled Pass Out of Existence.\n   Jason Hager later left the band after Pass Out Of Existence due to family\n   issues and the band gained Matt DeVries, a long time friend of the band and\n   guitarist for the Cleveland based band Ascension. Pass Out of Existence\n   didnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t sell that many records when it was released in 2001, but The\n   Impossibility of Reason, released in 2003, was enough to fund ChimairaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s\n   extensive touring with In Flames, and their second-stage performance at\n   Ozzfest, also in 2003.\n\n   Musically, Pass Out of Existence had a much more ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´electronicÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ sound than The\n   Impossibility of Reason, with Chris SpicuzzaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s pronounced electronic loops\n   featured in many songs. This sound was often compared to artists like Fear\n   Factory, Spineshank and Slipknot. The Impossibility of Reason kept with a\n   more pure, metal-esque instrumentation, akin to metalcore bands such as\n   Killswitch Engage, and this was found to be very popularÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹the album reached #2\n   on BillboardÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´HeatseekersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ chart.\n\n   Their self-titled album, released in August 2005, built upon the progress of\n   The Impossibility of Reason. The electronic feel of Pass Out of Existence and\n   This Present Darkness is much reduced, and the guitar riffs and solos are\n   taking a more central position to the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s music. The band hired Kevin\n   Talley (Dying Fetus, Misery Index) to fill position behind the drumkit.\n   The themes of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´rejection, revenge and repercussionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ [1] from The\n   Impossibility of Reason remain, although there are exceptions here - the\n   track ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´LazarusÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is named for, and written about a friend of Mark HunterÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s\n   (singer) commiting suicide. In mid-2006 Chimaira and Roadrunner announced\n   they would amicably part ways.\n\n   On March 6th, 2007, Chimaira released ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ResurrectionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ on Nuclear Blast/Ferret\n   Records, with some special packs containing a DVD of the making of the album.\n   Andols Herrick returned to the band, and musically the album is an evolution\n   of previous efforts. The songs feature heavy and pounding riffs, as in the\n   likes of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ChimairaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶, but also features more thoughtful melodic parts and,\n   what can be considered, more progressive solo parts and arrangements. Also\n   from Chris Spicuzza on keyboard there is a heavier contribution than on the\n   last album. The band even manage to create a black-metal-esque song with the\n   help of Morgoth The Impaler on keyboards. Unsurprisingly, the song\n   ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ResurrectionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ was written about the new lease of life the band (especially\n   Mark Hunter) felt upon release from Roadrunner, who they felt, were not\n   promoting the band as much as the band felt they deserved.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
