However, there is no rational, economic or moral reason to assume that governments are necessary for the provision of roads, healthcare, charity, dispute resolution, courts, policing, national defense, jails Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or any of the other services currently monopolized by the state.\n\nGovernments are extremely dangerous, responsible for over 250 million deaths in the 20th century alone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if it is possible to run a society without a government, surely this is something that we must strive towards as a species.\n\nPractical Anarchy makes strong case for the private Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that is to say voluntary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ provision for public services. It reveals the idea of government as a dangerous and unnecessary anachronism, and points the way towards a peaceful and voluntary future for mankind.\n\nAbout the author:\nStefan Molyneux is a Canadian philosopher, author, speaker, and host of Freedomain Radio.
