Following the successful The Humongous Books in calculus and algebra, bestselling author Mike Kelley takes a typical statistics workbook, full of solved problems, and writes notes in the margins, adding missing steps and simplifying concepts and solutions. By learning how to interpret and solve problems as they are presented in statistics courses, students prepare to solve those difficult problems that were never discussed in class but are always on exams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ed78f75c8954591dd32c944bc6a262b767d300","amp;dn":"The+Humongous+Book+of+Statistics+Problems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ed78f75c8954591dd32c944bc6a262b767d300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,237,120,247,92,137,84,89,29,211,44,148,75,198,162,98,183,103,211,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
