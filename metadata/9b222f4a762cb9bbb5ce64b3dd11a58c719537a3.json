This book sets out to remedy this situation: it begins by presenting the most frequently used experimental techniques in the study of the dynamic behavior of concrete, then continues by examining seismicity and seismic behavior, soil behavior, models of concrete structures subject to seismic activity, seismic calculation methods of structures, and paraseismic engineering.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 384 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-ISTE; 1 edition (April 27, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 184821071X\nISBN-13: 978-1848210714\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b222f4a762cb9bbb5ce64b3dd11a58c719537a3","amp;dn":"Dynamic+Behavior+of+Concrete+and+Seismic+Engineering+by+Jacky+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b222f4a762cb9bbb5ce64b3dd11a58c719537a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,34,47,74,118,44,185,187,181,206,100,179,221,17,165,140,113,149,55,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
