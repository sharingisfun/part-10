Through their voices, Pilling's Bending Adversity captures the dynamism and diversity of contemporary Japan.\n\n PillingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exploration begins with the 2011 triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown. His deep reporting reveals both JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vulnerabilities and its resilience and pushes him to understand the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past through cycles of crisis and reconstruction. JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survivalist mentality has carried it through tremendous hardship, but is also the source of great destruction: It was the nineteenth-century struggle to ward off colonial intent that resulted in JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own imperial endeavor, culminating in the devastation of World War II. Even the postwar economic miracleÃ¢â‚¬â€the manufacturing and commerce explosion that brought unprecedented economic growth and earned Japan international clout might have been a less pure victory than it seemed. In Bending Adversity Pilling questions what was lost in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blind, aborted climb to #1. With the same rigor, he revisits 1990Ã¢â‚¬â€the year the economic bubble burst, and the beginning of JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“lost decadesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€to ask if the turning point might be viewed differently. While financial struggle and national debt are a reality, post-growth Japan has also successfully maintained a stable standard of living and social cohesion. And while life has become less certain, opportunitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€in particular for the young and for womenÃ¢â‚¬â€have diversified. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab0397bad547dd0d14181862e1970d89badf5ba","amp;dn":"Bending+Adversity%3A+Japan+and+the+Art+of+Survival+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab0397bad547dd0d14181862e1970d89badf5ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,176,57,123,173,84,125,208,209,65,129,134,46,25,112,216,155,173,245,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
