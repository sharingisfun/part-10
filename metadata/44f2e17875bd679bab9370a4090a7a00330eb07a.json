Author Lorene Edwards Forkner Ã¢â‚¬â€ part eco-friendly non-traditionalist, part crafty creative Ã¢â‚¬â€ will show you how.\nProjects run the gamut from eye-catching structures, like a pergola made from plumbing pipes, to imaginative details, like a tree-hung chandelier for nighttime ambiance. You'll also find helpful plant guides to accompany projects: delectable herbs to fill a stacking container tower, stellar succulents for a vertical gutter garden, glorious flowering vines to climb a bamboo obelisk, and so much more.\nReady to get started? All you need are refreshingly simple, inexpensive materials Ã¢â‚¬â€ hardware store basics, salvaged goods, repurposed castoffs from cluttered basements Ã¢â‚¬â€ along with a little do-it-yourself spirit. With clear instructions and inspiring variations on every theme, this book is easy to follow and easy to love. Your journey to a made-from-scratch outdoor space starts here.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/3e/bb/d5446b19c3570ad8986c6c.L._V161335966_SY470_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/3e/bb/d5446b19c3570ad8986c6c.L._V161335966_SY470_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nA Seattle-based freelance writer, Lorene Edwards Forkner pursues a good and delicious life filled with travel, good food, family and friends together with all things horticultural, believing that the really good part is in the blending of one's passions.\nWhether evaluating a favorite plant, reveling in the changing light of the season, or enjoying the exquisite flavor of a juicy peach or the first garden salad of the year, Lorene never tires of exploring the colors, textures and details of the natural world.
