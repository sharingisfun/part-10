But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where corporations are mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because the atmosphere of Pandora is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human &quot;drivers&quot; have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi. \n\nReborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide nothing less than the fate of an entire world. \nProduction Status:\tReleased\nLogline:\t\n\n\n\nAVATAR takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a reluctant hero embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home.\nGenres:\tAction/Adventure and Science Fiction/Fantasy\n\nRunning Time:\t160 min.\nRelease Date:\tDecember 18th, 2009 (wide)\nMPAA Rating:\tPG-13 for intense epic battle sequences and warfare, sensuality, language and some smoking.\n\n\n \t\n \nActors:\nSam Worthington\tJake Sully\nZoe Saldana\tNeytiri\nSigourney Weaver\tGrace\nStephen Lang\tColonel Miles Quaritch\nMichelle Rodriguez\tTrudy Chacon\nGiovanni Ribisi\tParker Selfridge\nJoel David Moore\tNorm Spellman\nCCH Pounder\tMoat\nWes Studi\tEytukan\nLaz Alonso\tTsu'tey\nMatt Gerald\tCorporal Lyle Wainfleet\nSean Anthony Moran\tPrivate Fike\nJason Whyte\tCryo Vault Med Tech\nScott Lawrence\tVenture Star Crew Chief\nSean Patrick Murphy\tShuttle Co-Pilot\nKevin Dorman\tTractor Operator/Troupe\nKelson Henderson\tDragon Gunship Pilot\nDavid Van Horn\tDragon Gunship Gunner\nJacob Tomuri\tDragon Gunship Navigator\nMichael Blain-Rozgay\tSuit #1\nJon Curry\tSuit #2\nJulene Renee\tAmbient Room Tech/Troupe\nLuke Hawker\tAmbient Room Tech\nWoody Schultz\tAmbient Room Tech/Troupe\nPeter Mensah\tHorse Clan Leader\nIlram Choi\tBasketball Avatar\nDebra Skelton\tTroupe\nJulie Lamm\tTroupe\nFrank Torres\tTroupe\n\n\nDirectors:\nJames Cameron\tDirector\n\n\nWriters:\nJames Cameron\tscreenplay\n\n\nProducers:\nColin Wilson\tExecutive Producer\nLaeta Kalogridis\tExecutive Producer\nJames Cameron\tProducer\nJon Landau\tProducer\nBrooke Breton\tCo-Producer\nJosh McLaglen\tCo-Producer\nJanace Tashjian\tAssociate Producer\n\n\nI did not record this myself, I'm just helping seed along because there's such a demand for this movie.
