But even with all its references, dates, names, quotes, and careful scholarship, this biography reads like a novel that is impossible to put down. Caravaggio, of course, with his &quot;wild, wild spirit&quot; and &quot;very strange temper,&quot; according to contemporary accounts, is a natural subject for a galloping narrative. Caravaggio's religious and social status as a Knight of Malta, his protection by a famous cardinal, his street fighting, his fine silk clothes worn until they rotted away, his prostitute models and lowlife friends, his repeated failure to win a commission for St. Peter's, and his bitterness at the rise of mediocre rivals are just some of the ingredients of this good read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a4d45209a49fc1bf35758b2b5c1f5871932b22b","amp;dn":"Caravaggio_+A+Passionate+Life+by+Desmond+Seward.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a4d45209a49fc1bf35758b2b5c1f5871932b22b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,77,69,32,154,73,252,27,243,87,88,178,181,193,245,135,25,50,178,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
