Among the nine people he lives with are: a father, who is suffering from malnutrition and a fatal illness; a brother, who is a former Nazi soldier hiding to avoid arrest; and a sister, who has turned to prostitution. Scouring the rubble-strewn city for food, money, and cigarettes, he comes upon a former teacher, Herr Enning (Erich Guhne), who evinces a barely restrained sexual attraction to the boy while providing him with records of Hitler's speeches that can be bartered on the black market. He also drums into the boy a classic piece of Nazi propaganda about the importance of having the courage to let the weak be destroyed. Under his influence, the confused young protagonist heads down a tragic path.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe20836fd0ed14422e11a5afaa9f20442412ffe","amp;dn":"Germania+Anno+Zero+1948+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe20836fd0ed14422e11a5afaa9f20442412ffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,226,8,54,253,14,209,68,34,225,26,90,250,169,242,4,66,65,47,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
