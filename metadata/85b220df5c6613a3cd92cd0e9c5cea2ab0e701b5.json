The first one I ordered has 11 songs on it, starting with &quot;Terra Firma&quot; and ending with &quot;Amongst the Ruins&quot;. ...Then I ordered this CD &quot;Poem [EXTRA TRACKS]&quot; for ... which also has 11 songs but starting with &quot;Innocence&quot; and ending with &quot;Silence&quot;. &quot;Terra Firma&quot; (my favorite song) is NOT on this CD and there are NO extra tracks. Instead they put the &quot;Silence&quot; on it. Then there is the third album &quot;Poem [Limited Edition Bonus CD] [BOX SET]&quot; selling for .... I believe that one has extra tracks. All of these albums have the same picture on the cover.
