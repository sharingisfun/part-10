Robert is \r\na little hoarse and seems almost shy but good nonetheless, and \r\nexcept for a messed up solo in Misty Mountain Hop, Page's \r\nplaying is fluid, fast, and wonderful! Bonham and Jones, as usual, \r\nsound fine. A curious set list that is very refreshing and the \r\nangry solo in Achilles Last Stand is a highlight. Problems with \r\na power generation delayed the show. Band's lightning rig was too \r\nbig for venue and a generator had blown up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c390708c5ae685d7619571c162132b360e9f48","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1979.07.23+Copenhagen%2C+Denmark+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c390708c5ae685d7619571c162132b360e9f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,195,144,112,140,90,230,133,215,97,149,113,193,98,19,43,54,14,159,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
