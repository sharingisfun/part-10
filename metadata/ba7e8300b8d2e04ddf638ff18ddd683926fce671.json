Raising Sand has to be one of the best ever examples of this.\nMost people would have bet on Plant?s ex-band mate, John Paul Jones, as being the one to have forged this big league bluegrasss pairing.\nAfter all he's worked with Chris Thile and Nickel Creek as well as Uncle Earl, and plays a mean mandolin himself. But no, it's the grizzled,\nleonine king of c*ck rock who gets to get up-close and personal with the Union Station legend. And thank goodness it was,\nbecause Raising Sand has to be one of the releases of the year.\n\n\nThe first thing you notice about Raising Sand is how the pair's vocals compliment each other. Krauss? honey-sweet chords can be\nsaccharine on her own work at times, but here she's balanced by the mature grain of Plant's almost whispered delivery. On Killing\nThe Blues or Gene Clark?s &quot;Polly Come Home&quot; they nudge up against each other, buoyed up by Greg Leisz?s floating pedal steel.\nAnd this from a man reknowned for going ?baybeeee, baybeee?. Phew...\n\n\nThe selection of songs proves to be just as inspired as the pairing. With material by the Everlys (&quot;Gone, Gone Gone&quot;), Townes van Zant (&quot;Nothin?&quot;)\nand even one from Plant?s last collaboration with Jimmy Page (&quot;Please Read The Letter&quot; ? completely improved from its original incarnation)\nit would be hard to go that wrong, but the best of an embarrassment of riches has to be Krauss? rendition of Tom Waits &quot;Trampled Rose&quot;.\nSpellbinding doesn?t even come close to describing this.\n\n\nThe album?s other main star has to be T Bone Burnett. His production adds a veneer of authenticity and his choice of musicians is spot on at every turn.\nMarc Ribot (guitar) along with Dennis Crouch, Mike Seeger, Jay Bellerose, Norman Blake, Greg Leisz, Patrick Warren, and Riley Baugus make this a stunning,\ndark, brooding collection, comparable in tone to Daniel Lanois' masterful job on Dylan's Time Out Of Mind. It captures a gothic southern vibe effortlessly.\n\n\nHearing Krauss emote so bluesily on tracks like &quot;Rich Woman&quot; is a revelation, while her coruscating fiddle on &quot;Nothin'&quot;\nis rawer than you?d ever expect to hear from such a pillar of the new bluegrasss community. Raising Sand is proof that even with such dynamite raw\nmaterial sometimes things really do add up to far more than the sum of their parts. Superb, in every way? \n\n\n1. (00:04:05) - Rich Woman\n2.
