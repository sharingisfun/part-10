The game is distributed by DRM-free download. You'll also get a Steam key.\n\nRimWorld is being created by Tynan Sylvester and Ludeon Studios. 9498 people pledged $268,132 on the RimWorld Kickstarter page.\n\nThe AI Storyteller\nI've always thought the best part of games like Dwarf Fortress and The Sims was the stories that come out of them. That's why RimWorld is designed as a story generator. It's not about winning and losing - it's about the drama, tragedy, and comedy that goes on in your colony.\n\nTo keep things interesting, the game creates events like pirate raids, trader arrivals, and storms. But these events aren't random. RimWorld uses an AI Storyteller (modeled after the AI Director from Left 4 Dead) who analyzes your situation and decides which event she thinks will make the best story. There are several storytellers to choose from:\n\nCassandra Classic aims to create a rising curve of tension over the course of the game. Early on, the most dangerous thing she'll do is send a psychotic squirrel after you. Later on, bands of scavengers will arrive. In the late game, look forward to combined-arms attacks from mercenaries mixed with lightning storms and crop blights. If you want a traditional tension and difficulty curve, go with Cassandra.\nPhoebe Friendly is for the player who just wants to build and watch a colony grow. She'll occasionally create minor disasters, but nothing that would threaten the existence of the colony. If you want a more relaxing game about growth and success, choose Phoebe.\nRandy Random follows no rules. He may give you some amazing stroke of luck, like a trader selling an advanced weapon for a low price or a group of helpful immigrants, followed by a near-unbeatable pirate attack combined with an electrical fire. If you think losing is fun, you might want to try Randy.\nAnd we're considering other AI Storytellers, too. High population storytellers, starvation storytellers, seasonal storytellers, moody storytellers, and anything the community thinks up are all on the table.\n\nAn aboveground colony at night.\nAn aboveground colony at night.\nA motley crew\nIn RimWorld, your colonists are not professional settlers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re survivors from a crashed passenger liner. They'll be accountants, homemakers, journalists, cooks, nobles, urchins, and soldiers.\n\nEach character has a background that affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (for recruiting prisoners or negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically-engineered assassin can do nothing but kill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but he does that very well.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll acquire more colonists by taking in refugees, capturing people in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, rescuing them, or taking in migrants.\n\nOver the course of long games, players develop a motley group of refugees, pirate raiders, purchased slaves, and crashlanded survivors. The diversity of people makes each colony unique.\n\nYou won't get hundreds of colonists - we want to keep the number small enough that you can know each one individually.\n\n Raiders burn out some walled-in colonists.\nRaiders burn out some walled-in colonists.\nThe tactics engine\nRimWorld uses an engine that I originally developed to power a tactical sim similar to Jagged Alliance 2. This means it has a lot of features designed to make small-team firefights interesting. For example:\n\nThere's a cover system that models low cover and leaning around corners.\nThere's a really nuanced algorithm for determining and reporting hit chances based on distance, skill, weapon, lighting, angle, and cover.\nWeapons have some pretty deep stats.\nThe AI plans and executes tactical moves like flanking while trying to stay out of the enemy's line of fire. It uses a number of heuristic algorithms to analyze the battlefield and use the space effectively. It works with allies and avoids bunching up.\nI think most base-builder developers wouldn't put this much effort into a tactics engine, but having inherited from that earlier project, RimWorld benefits greatly in unexpected ways.\n\nBecause of how important cover and positioning are in gunfights, our combat interacts deeply with the colony's layout and structure. This means players have to think about how they want to position their constructions to maximum advantage in future firefights. Combat in general is a lot more interesting than the traditional trading of blows you might expect in a base-building game. And it's possible to build a wide variety of base configurations for maximum tactical advantage against diverse foes.\n\n Raiders assault from the north.

So we've created an adaptive teaching system that watches your actions to figure out which parts of the game you understand, and teaches the parts you're missing. If you don't understand a control, the game will notice and help you out unobtrusively. If you already know something, the game won't interrupt you.\n\nRimWorld also uses a notification system to make sure you don't miss anything that needs looking at. If you're low on food, or a colonist is about to go berserk, a message hovers in the corner of the screen informing you of the fact. No more getting annihilated because you missed some little detail. If you get annihilated, it'll be for a totally legitimate reason.\n\nPsychology\nPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. You can inspect a character's psychology at any time to see what they're feeling and why.\n\nWhen a colonist becomes too stressed, they may suffer a &quot;mental break&quot;. Some will give up and wander the colony for a time. Some will leave. And some will, in dwarfish fashion, become psychotic and throw a violent tantrum.\n\nSheckley the miner thinks about a recent battle while rescuing a wounded friend.\nSheckley the miner thinks about a recent battle while rescuing a wounded friend.\nThe universe\nThe flavor of RimWorld is a mix between hard sci-fi and the Old West. It's a rim world at the edge of the galaxy, far from the civilized core worlds. The planet is vast and mostly empty, and there are no strong civilizing authorities anywhere nearby. You're on your own.\n\nThe core idea in the RimWorld universe is diversity. In this setting, humanity is spread across the galaxy, yet lacks any way of traveling or communicating faster than light. Combined with the fact that stellar civilizations regress (due to war or plague) as often as they progress, this means that someone traveling between stars may end up interacting with people at any level of development, from pre-agricultural tribes to transcendent machine gods.\n\nYour starting colonists in RimWorld are at a technological level in the middle of this span. But you may end up interacting with people at much lower and higher levels, as well as acquiring and using their tools and weapons. In RimWorld, a single fight can involve a bow and arrow, a revolver, a charged-shot pulse rifle, and a near-magical teleportation device.\n\nA developed underground colony with a large hydroponic grow-op.\nA developed underground colony with a large hydroponic grow-op.\nInspiration\nIn its fiction, RimWorld draws a lot from Firefly. This is where it gets its subtle Western vibe - frontier living, an arid environment, sparse law enforcement, and the constant threat of outlaws. We're also heavily inspired by science fiction novels like Dune and Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space series (which both Alistair Lindsay and I are huge fans of). The Warhammer 40,000 universe also forms part of our inspiration.\n\nIn terms of game design, the game draws most from the 800-pound gorilla of the simulation genre, Dwarf Fortress. We also take ideas from indie hits like FTL (our semi-random event format) and Prison Architect (its way of presenting a complex world in a comprehensible, interactive way). And, there are many others.\n\nLightning strikes during a rainstorm.\nLightning strikes during a rainstorm\n\n[Game Information]: \n\nName: RimWorld\nVersion: Depends on the update.\nCustom Auto Updater?: yes\nRecomended Memory (RAM): 1GB\nMinimal Memory (RAM): 512 MB\nOS Type (Pc/Mac/Linux): PC (Windows)\nWindows Version(s): XP/Vista/7/8\n[End Game Information]\n\nThanks to: \n\nRimWorld devolopers for creating the game. If you enjoy this game, remember to seed, and if you can, purchase the game for your self on Steam. I upload my torrents for you TRY the games that do not have demos. I highly suggest after you see if you like the game, you delete the pirated version and buy the game (RimWorld) on Steam, for more frequent updates then this version. This version only updates when I know I will not be caught for uploading it. (I don't want prison time). Thanks all! And remember to Seed for the game. Also, remember to like the game on Steam.\n\n[Other Notes:]\nif you do comment in the comments that this does not work, please provide proof that the launcher is not working so I can fix the Download link it uses. Do not edit any of the files in the folder that it uses, as it will break the downloader, and make it where you have to install the game again.\n\n[Install Notes:]\nTo install this game, extract the ZIP file to the location of your choice. Make sure it is in an empty folder that you extract it to as the launcher needs the launcher files only to download the game. After the first patch, the game will be fully updated. The RimWorld ZIP file that the downloader downloads is 19.7 MB big. It will automatically extract the contents for you, and mark that it has updates on that day. It will also mark the last edited version in the download link. If you wish to download old versions, please let me know in the comments what version you would like, and I will tell you if I have it in the old links... If I do not, you will not be able to get that version from me. The first version downloaded by the Launcher does have mod support, but in the alpha update versions. This is an offical steam rip of the game so it runs perfectly. To reinstall the game itself, open the launcher.ini file and remove the value(S) for: lastupdate\nThen, delete the game files (Mods, Game_Data, Game.exe) and run the launcher again.\n[End Install Notes]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74496d162538fb7d99555f30070ac1ca9c6b4bdd","amp;dn":"RimWorld+AutoUpdater+-+Game+Alwase+Updated%21+%28When+Possible%29+%5B%5E%5ET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74496d162538fb7d99555f30070ac1ca9c6b4bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,73,109,22,37,56,251,125,153,85,95,48,7,10,193,202,156,107,75,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
