It comes off loose and free, as if no charts were thrown at the musicians and they simply went at these three standards (two being movie-theme ballads), along with two of Jacquet's numbers, completely off the cuff. Moody leads on flute for the sultry bossa &quot;Ebb Tide,&quot; with Farmer playing flugelhorn and Jacquet only getting his feet wet later in the bridge; all three counter jab near the end. &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot; is more typical, with Burrell leading, Jacquet's mushy, blues-drenched tenor playing the melody, and Moody's flute filling whatever cracks crop up. The low-down &quot;Birthday Party Blues&quot; ballad is set up by Burrell and Six; Mulligan and Newman traipse through the midsection of this ten-minute jam, while Illinois' woodwind howls and the others chime in a bit. &quot;Polka Dots &amp; Moonbeams&quot; is all Jacquet's, and he takes the baton, although Six goes it alone twice, and Burrell takes the rhythm section on solos. The cover of &quot;On the Beach&quot; is a hard, rip-roaring swinger, with the birthday boy leading and others to follow. Moody's smoother tenor provides a fine contrast to Jacquet's signature Texas edge; Newman's great muted trumpet with the rhythm trio is only further evidence that he should not continue being an uncrowned king. As short as it is (36 minutes), it's a shame there isn't more material -- too bad, for this was an incredible band.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; - 4:06\n2. &quot;Birthday Party Blues&quot; - 10:37\n3. &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot; - 5:24\n4. &quot;On the Beach&quot; - 12:59\n5. &quot;Polka Dots and Moonbeams&quot; - 5:48\n\nPersonnel:\n\nIllinois Jacquet - tenor saxophone\nJoe Newman - trumpet\nArt Farmer - flugelhorn\nJimmie Smith - piano\nKenny Burrell - guitar\nJack Six - bass\nRoy Haynes - drums\nGerry Mulligan - baritone saxophone\nJames Moody - tenor saxophone, flute\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38a04b297395b55b3cb25a7ade67052874cd5326","amp;dn":"Illinois+Jacquet++Birthday+Party+%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38a04b297395b55b3cb25a7ade67052874cd5326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,160,75,41,115,149,181,91,60,178,90,122,222,103,5,40,116,205,83,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
