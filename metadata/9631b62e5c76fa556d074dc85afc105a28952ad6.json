Curved Multi-planar Reconstruction (Curved MPR) is a very useful tool in Dental CT. A volume is built by stacking the axial slices one behind the other. Curved Multi-planar Reconstruction involves generating perspectives to the stack of axial slices so that panoramic images and images from paraxial cuts can be generated.\n\nSante Dental CT's main features:\n\n- The program allows the user to insert many panoramic lines \n- The program can generate automatically paraxial lines perpendicular to segments of a panoramic line. The user can add paraxial lines manually as well \n- The program allows the user to perform measurements (length, angle) in the panoramic and paraxial images \n- The program allows the user to annotate the panoramic and paraxial images with texts and arrows \n- The program can print a synthesis of a panoramic image and its paraxial images \n- The paraxial images are printed in 1:1 scale (full scale)\n- On-line, case sensitive help\n- Windows 8/7/Vista compatible \n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n- Windows 8/7/Vista or above (the program is not compatible with Windows XP or earlier)\n- The Microsoft DirectX Library\n- Intel Core 2 Duo 1.86 GHz or greater\n- 1024MB memory or greater\n- Graphics card with 512 MB memory, and compatible with DirectX 10\n- Monitor that supports resolution 1024x768 or above, and true color (16M Colors)\n- Pointer device (Mouse)\n- 20MB free space on hard disk\n\nHomepage: http://santesoft.com/sante_dental_ct.html\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Extract zip\n- Install program.\n- Pre-cracked, No any crack or key required for registration.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9631b62e5c76fa556d074dc85afc105a28952ad6","amp;dn":"Sante+Dental+CT+v1.20+Cracked-F4CG+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9631b62e5c76fa556d074dc85afc105a28952ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,49,182,46,92,118,250,85,109,7,77,200,90,252,16,90,40,149,42,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
