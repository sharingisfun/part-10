Bolstered by a radio-ready, appropriately bitter first single, &quot;Sick,&quot; a movie trailer-ready, Killers-esque anthem in &quot;Alive,&quot; and a vulnerable, midtempo ballad called &quot;I Can Tell,&quot; High School Valedictorian sounds precise, pained, and impeccable, which is really what modern rock is about. Like any good pop record, the verse/chorus formula is applied liberally, and when the band sinks its teeth in, as they do on opener &quot;The Collapse,&quot; it's hard not to get wrapped up in the angst of it all. ~ James Christopher Monger\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n\n\n1\tCollapse\t \t\n\n\n2\tSick \t \t\n\n\n3\tAlive\t\t \t\n\n\n4\tCriticize\t \n\n\n5\tGood Enough\t \n\n\n6\tCage the Beast\t\t \n\n\n7\tI Can Tell\t\t \n\n\n8\tSomebody Wishes They Were You\t \t\n\n\n9\tMove\t\n\n\n10\tI WANNA BE\n\n\n11\tHurt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7797ac52bbbe8fc72bcf8065c520fa468149d1d3","amp;dn":"Adelitas+Way-Home+School+Valedictorian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7797ac52bbbe8fc72bcf8065c520fa468149d1d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,151,172,82,187,190,143,199,43,207,128,101,197,32,250,70,129,73,209,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
