In his first movie \nlead, Donahue is strong, handsome and unshakably devoted as lovestruck \nJohnny Hunter. And 17-year-old Dee is pixieish Molly, a woman/child \nstruggling to cope with adult emotions. Set to a lush Max Steiner score \nthat produced one of the most unforgettable movie themes ever, this \nbox-office hit also stars adults (Dorothy McGuire, Richard Egan, \nArthur Kennedy, Constance Ford) also romantically at odds. As Johnny, \nMolly and their parents discover, love will find a way. They&amp;#039;ve already \nfound the locale: A Summer Place. \n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nÃ‚Â¶ About : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053320/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053320/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800123597/info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800123597/info&lt;/a&gt;\nA Summer Place (1959)\n*\n1 CD, 930MB\nDVDripped to AVI-NO Qpel, Standalone support enabled: ESS.\n 23.976 fps,  608*352 (16:9),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4,Audio VBR,MP3.\n[as reported by http://avicodec.duby.info/ ]\nSource: DVD-NTSC\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db14df54fa752d49d7e8dde1de246da723770c29","amp;dn":"A+Summer+Place","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db14df54fa752d49d7e8dde1de246da723770c29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,20,223,84,250,117,45,73,215,232,221,225,222,36,109,167,35,119,12,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
