Though Warren G appears throughout, it&amp;#039;s mostly a Dogg&amp;#039;s day as Snoop and Nate give the album its gangsta-lean feel. The vibe is strictly laid back--the group pens odes to liquor, women, and weed, including a remake of Rick James&amp;#039;s &quot;Mary Jane&quot; (released just before the singer&amp;#039;s passing). For the most part however, 213 has their minds on sex more than smoking out, with playful cuts like &quot;Groupie Luv&quot; balancing the profane shock of &quot;My Dirty Ho.&quot; Musically, they lay down classic G-Funk with that signature squeegee sound--just the right groove for street cruising and backyard partying, especially the sweet soul of &quot;Another Summer&quot; and the catchy funk of &quot;Lil Girl.&quot; The Hard Way isn&amp;#039;t quite as strong as you&amp;#039;d expect from such a marquee trio, but if you&amp;#039;re looking for a collection of pleasant made-for-summer tunes, 213 is the area code to dial. --Oliver Wang  \n\n\n\n1.
