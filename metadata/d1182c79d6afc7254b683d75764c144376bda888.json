It also sends up \ntabloid newspapers, with mockeries of articles and letters pages. \nIt features competitions and advertisements for overpriced \n'limited edition' tat, such as a cat which &quot;shits its own weight \nin gold&quot;, as well as obsessions with half-forgotten celebrities \nfrom the 1970s and 1980s such as Shakin' Stevens and Rodney Bewes. \nOccasionally, it satirises current events and politicians, but has \nno particular political standpoint. Its success has led to \nthe appearance of numerous rivals crudely copying the format \nViz pioneered; none of them has managed seriously to challenge \nits popularity. It once enjoyed being the third most popular \nmagazine in the UK,\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1182c79d6afc7254b683d75764c144376bda888","amp;dn":"Viz+Magazine+%28UK%29+June+2013+-+AfT3RLiF3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1182c79d6afc7254b683d75764c144376bda888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,24,44,121,214,175,199,37,75,104,61,117,118,76,20,67,118,189,168,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
