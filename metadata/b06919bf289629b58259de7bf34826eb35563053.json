Also included is the unusual New Arkansas Travellers release &quot;I Tickled 'Em,&quot; and &quot;Handy Man,&quot; both of which are part of the music hall tradition and sung by Englishman A.P. Bishop! \n\nIt's hard to go wrong with these obscure 94 recordings cut in the 1920s and '30s. The tracks have been remastered, making the majority of this material sound great. Unlike other packages of this type, the liner notes are informative; listing personnel, dates and a concise history without going on ad nauseam. As an extra bonus this is a budget-priced set making it highly recommended, for both the collector and the novice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06919bf289629b58259de7bf34826eb35563053","amp;dn":"Serenade+In+The+Mountains+%284CD-JSP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06919bf289629b58259de7bf34826eb35563053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,105,25,191,40,150,41,181,130,89,222,123,243,72,38,235,53,86,48,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
