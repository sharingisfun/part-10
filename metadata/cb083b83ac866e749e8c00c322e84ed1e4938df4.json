The opening title track lends itself as much to Margo Timmins as it does to a latter-day Lucinda Williams ÃƒÂ  la &quot;Lonely Girls&quot; in its almost morose tempo and arrangements, making the nearly seven-minute song glide along effortlessly and, to the listener, far shorter. The following numbers offer the same barren sounds, evoking images of members recording the songs in a log cabin. The well-trodden but solidly produced tracks never waver, especially &quot;Doralee&quot; and the slightly upbeat, honky tonk of &quot;Lonely Hill.&quot; Resembling a trace of Neil Young's &quot;Harvest Moon,&quot; the tune discusses heartbreak over a cross between Appalachian music and traditional country twang. &quot;Don't Let Me Go&quot; is another fine gem that doesn't stray too far from Sykes' strong points. While not having a dynamic range, she certainly knows what works. Only on &quot;Drinking With Strangers,&quot; with its harmonies and backing instruments, does it sound a bit forced and too over-the-top. Returning to the melodic, swaying sound of &quot;Love Me, Someday,&quot; the band is very well versed in a quasi dirge-country. A very sound and gentle series of heartbreaking vignettes makes this album so adorable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb083b83ac866e749e8c00c322e84ed1e4938df4","amp;dn":"Jesse+Sykes+%26amp%3B+the+Sweet+Hereafter+-+Reckless+Burning+%5B2002%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb083b83ac866e749e8c00c322e84ed1e4938df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,8,59,131,172,134,110,116,158,140,0,195,34,232,78,209,228,147,141,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
