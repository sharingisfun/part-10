Sing a Song of Sex). Oshima hits his favorite topicsÃ¢â‚¬â€politics, sexuality, and transgressionÃ¢â‚¬â€in this embittered portrait of a youth culture whose visions of sex and rebellion are nothing more than dreams. Four provincial students (including singer Ichiro Araki, whose blank-slate calm earned him praise from Oshima as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the first New Wave actorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) are in Tokyo for final exams, but they learn more from a drunken professor who quotes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love is the only form of resistanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to doe-eyed coeds (Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to read Henry Miller,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sighs one). Dreaming of sexual exploits, they wander disillusioned across a politicized, sexually commodified landscape of FounderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day marches, lurid red-light-district posters, and, in one hilariously odd sequence, mass rallies of folk singers and Christian revivalists. Constantly questioning, unable to fit in or channel their pent-up energies, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder their songs of protest and sex and their fantasies of rape and revolution lead nowhere. Shot in a CinemaScope pop palette similar to that of Three Resurrected Drunkards, this darkly ambiguous film has been compared to GodardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s La Chinoise.
