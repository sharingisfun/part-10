Reading it to page 9 (Where the caption asks you to keep an open mind) should give you a complete idea if the writing is for you or not. Although I find the later topics more interesting than the intro. Kudos to the author though he/she is getting better with the text editor this time around. :))\n\n\nQuotes:\n======\n\nIts meant as refreshment if you are getting sick of the fluffy stream of &quot;info&quot; telling you paradise and/or oblivion is around the corner, and saviors are stomping all over each other on their way to rescue us from our every trouble. Not to forget the preachers selling the line that, a certain shady figure or techno gadget is responsible for all the troubles in the world, then dissecting their lineage tree. Either way the increasing number of Ã¢â‚¬Å“enlighteningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ materials floating about is seriously sodomizing our vomit reflex lately, even if conspiracy is absent from your lexicon. You know the drillÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Vote for us, give us your moneys, pray at our temples - just do as we tell you and we'll give you paradise, SUBSCRIBE NOW 1! and get the free penis enlargement program if you call us in the next 4 seconds! You don't have to lift a finger; Jesus will do this, Moses that, technology the other thing and when you vote us in office and we will take care of the rest!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ((:\n\nIf you had enough of the shit they had to shovel out of bookstores by the truckloads after the 21st December 2012 didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t open our 37 chakras in addition to enabling us to read auras or explode our heads courtesy of the antichrist or whatever - hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something to blow off the stench. Same goes for most of the endless bastardized conspiracy topics, the internet never seems to run out of. -Mind you IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just saying they get annoying Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the attention span to insure against every kind of bias this book might face Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so we are not getting into any validity claims on conspiracy of whatever derivative.\n\nThis is anything but some humane generous act of revelation, or any other type of Ã¢â‚¬Å“sweetenedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ candy giveaway, the least of which is some supposedly profound truth presented to you with the claim or slimy suggestions yelling silently that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relevant and/or valuable information that you need to believe.\n\nThe shit in here isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tucked under the rug or dressed up like a commercial flick where you get 50 friends by just chewing the right brand of bubble-gum. So, if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it on you - DO, mind your step.\n\n:A sample of how conspiracy topics are handled:\n==================================\n\nIlluminati?!\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best wrap up of the illuminati I can think of. As such, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter that the Illuminati exist or not. What does matter is that the very tangible and observable arrogance we can track across all of humanity exists along with various other behaviors of the sort. So whether exactly the Ã¢â‚¬Å“IlluminatiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ exist or not, you can be sure that there are individuals and groups with huge resources and influence whom would not think twice to cooperate if that meant furthering their goals. And as we can see thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no shortage of people in the world that want to impose their will on others. So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irrelevant if such a group is called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“IlluminatiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Purple Pony PartyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and which of the true conspiracy acts can be pinned to them. For those who keep an eye out if not some imagination - it is already demonstrated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“high classÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ people meet and discuss stuff in private without having to account themselves to the public. If you are the evidence type, you can just review the Bilderberg meetings without much need to go into depth. As for conspiracy in general - after all, the only guy with authority and global screen time who dared to speak against conspiracy and secret societies in a global television cast - was short after publicly executed, then the investigation of his murder is a debacle to this day, not to mention most of his bloodline was stomped into the ground not long after. Not that I think it was a good move on his part. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just announce your intent to abolish secrecy throughout society and expect nobody is going to react badly, especially when even the people who cheer for you are going to oppose you as soon as you start doing that. Not to mention that cheering for you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be confused with any kind of assistance on the matter. After all, what happens if they shoot you? WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to carry on the work? The same people that have zealously avoided that precise kind of work throughout their lives?! Whom else? -Your supposed allies whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably assist in your assassination so long as they get something off it? I bow down to the effort of the guy, but clearly he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think it through all too well. I mean if you need any Ã¢â‚¬Å“proofÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that there is conspiracy, you probably wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it before there is a bullet in you or a boot carving a print on your forehead - not that those will convince you either (; As for the Purple Pony Party (: Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Well, we should be thankful if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one of those, and I doubt thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32104c3d83b9f3537a6fab9f39a092474dbb9344","amp;dn":"A+Fool+Walking-through+Enlightened+Bullshit+R9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32104c3d83b9f3537a6fab9f39a092474dbb9344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,16,76,61,131,185,243,83,122,111,171,159,57,160,146,71,77,187,147,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
