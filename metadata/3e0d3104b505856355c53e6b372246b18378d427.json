Welcome To The Family\n\nWilliam Clark Green is the latest in the long series of singer/songwriters who have cut their teeth on the dusty plains of west Texas before taking a bite of Texas at large. The momentum behind GreenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career has been building steadily the past couple years before reaching a fever pitch of buzz here in 2013. Rose Queen, GreenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third release, is arguably the most anticipated release of the first half of this year in Texas Music, which says quite a bit due to strong releases forthcoming from scene headliners.\n\nRose Queen is a stylistic triumph that builds on the strengths of GreenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past album Misunderstood. Producer Rachel Loy has managed to smooth out GreenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rough edges without losing any of his intensity and authenticity. The title track kicks the record off with a statement that grabs your ears and informs you that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in for something unique. Green has taken the heady lyrical approaches of a Chris Knight and partnered it with an Americana rock punch reminiscent of Reckless Kelly throughout the album. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½RemedyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ juxtaposes a breezy melody on top of lovelorn lyrics replete with references to being strung out. The romp of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dead or In JailÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ brings to mind KMAG YOYO era Hayes Carll. Rapid fire lyrics of a bad trip in more than one sense staccato over a driving rhythm. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½She Likes The BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is perhaps the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most significant track as it distills the style Green has polished into its most basic elements. Co-written with Brian Keane, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an angst ridden tale of opposites attracting to the point of frustrated appreciation.\n\nThis album is a jump in quality that sees William Clark Green raising the bar for himself and all others claiming a stake in 2013 Texas Music. It is real, raw and accessible. A hard combination of emotion and senses to pull off and one Green does admirably. Whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lived all the songs on this album or not, Green makes you believe he has and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the most important thing. Believablility and authenticity are often missing in modern music of all genres. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the case here. This record is one youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be hearing a lot from for the foreseeable future. Listening to this reminded me of the first time I heard Turnpike Troubadours Diamonds and Gasoline and knew they were destined to reach that next touring and respect rung. Rose Queen has put Green squarely on the map and is a refreshing reassurance that the future of Texas Music is in solid hands.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0d3104b505856355c53e6b372246b18378d427","amp;dn":"William+Clark+Green+-+Rose+Queen+%5B2013%5D%5B+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e0d3104b505856355c53e6b372246b18378d427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,13,49,4,181,5,133,99,85,197,62,107,55,34,70,177,131,120,212,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
