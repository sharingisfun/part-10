I can not tell you how much I adore Amedeo Minghi! When I recently read that Amedeo was a composer for one of the songs and, I also saw photo's of him at Andrea's presentation in his home.... well..... my heart was thumping! I just love the guy! And I have since 1996 when my father bought me his disc for Christmas. My mom &amp; dad had gone to San Francisco and into the little Italian store in North Beach prior to Christmas and all on his own, my dad went up to the owner and told him, &quot;I would like the most romantic Italian cd that you have, for my daughter for Christmas&quot;. The owner walked directly to a certain spot in the racks and pulled out the Amedeo Minghi &quot;Cantare d'Amore&quot; disc and said, &quot;this is the disc for your daughter&quot;. oooh!\n\nMy father told me the story after I opened his Christmas gift. He also wrote a little tiny notecard to me in his handwritting telling me to &quot;play this when I do my houseword&quot; (lol) and a few other words. That card, his thoughts, the disc... just meant the whole world to me. Just 2 months ago I had that little card in my hand reminising that beautiful memory. My dad died the following October. That was the last gift he he given me.\n\nMy point is..... that disc is one of my favorite discs I own. His music moves me very deeply. In Sept I was talking to a friend at our favorite Italian restaurant in S.F.... he is a pianist and he told me that he's met Amedeo many times. I was sooo excited! ahahaha!\n\n\nSorry this is so long, FORUM. Just seeing Amedeo's name got me excited! lol! I love Italian music like you can't believe. Amedeo Mingi's cd was my first Italian cd. Baci a Amedeo da me! And believe you me, I really do lllllove &quot;the music&quot; in Un solo amore al mondo. Proof of that in an earlier post of mine today, and I didn't even know he was the composer of it yet. Sorpendente! There you go. Love Minghi!\n\nTake care! Sorrisi!
