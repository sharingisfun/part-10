Perhaps just a lack of free time... Get ready to spend hours capturing the enemy fortresses and the surrounding land, and forming militias with LandGrabbers! This game is a unique genre to the world of casual games, but combines classic elements of strategy, simulator, and resource management games. Get ready to play forty-five gripping levels in the woods, in the desert, the snow and even on the lava covered moon! Three different difficulty modes will challenge even the best strategy experts.
