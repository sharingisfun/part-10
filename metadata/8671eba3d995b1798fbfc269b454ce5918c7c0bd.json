It has many applications in our every day life such as air-conditioners, electric cars, sub-way trains, motor drives, renewable energy sources and power supplies for computers. This book covers all aspects of switching devices, converter circuit topologies, control techniques, analytical methods and some examples of their applications.\n\n\nPower Electronics Handbook, Third Edition-P2P\n2011 | PDF | English | 1362 pages | 43 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8671eba3d995b1798fbfc269b454ce5918c7c0bd","amp;dn":"Power+Electronics+Handbook%2C+Third+Edition-P2P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8671eba3d995b1798fbfc269b454ce5918c7c0bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,113,235,163,217,149,177,121,143,191,194,105,180,84,206,89,24,199,192,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
