Shirer - Berlin Diary\n\nSubtitle: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent, 1934Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1941\n\nWinner of the AudioFile Earphones Award\nAn Audible CustomersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Five-Star Listen for 2011: History\n\nBy the acclaimed journalist and bestselling author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, this day-by-day, eyewitness account of the momentous events leading up to World War II in Europe is the private, personal, utterly revealing journal of a great foreign correspondent.\n\nCBS radio broadcaster William L. Shirer was virtually unknown in 1940 when he decided there might be a book in the diary he had kept in Europe during the 1930sÃ¢â‚¬â€specifically those sections dealing with the collapse of the European democracies and the rise of Nazi Germany.\n\nShirer was the only Western correspondent in Vienna on March 11, 1938, when the German troops marched in and took over Austria, and he alone reported the surrender by France to Germany on June 22, 1940, even before the Germans reported it. The whole time, Shirer kept a record of events, many of which could not be publicly reported because of censorship by the Germans. In December 1940, Shirer learned that the Germans were building a case against him for espionage, an offense punishable by death. Fortunately, Shirer escaped and was able to take most of his diary with him.\n\nBerlin Diary first appeared in 1941, and the timing was perfect. The energy, the passion, and the electricity in it were palpable. The book was an instant success, and it became the frame of reference against which thoughtful Americans judged the rush of events in Europe. It exactly matched journalist to event: the right reporter at the right place at the right time. It stood, and still stands, as so few books have ever doneÃ¢â‚¬â€a pure act of journalistic witness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:798c1caec2ee46094dd150d9648af4ab593a84da","amp;dn":"William+L.+Shirer+-+Berlin+Diary+%28Nazi+Germany+1934-1941%29+40kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"798c1caec2ee46094dd150d9648af4ab593a84da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,140,28,174,194,238,70,9,77,209,80,217,100,138,244,171,89,58,132,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
