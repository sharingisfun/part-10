To address these problems, researchers often incorporate the concepts of fuzzy sets and evolutionary algorithms into MOP models.\n\nFocusing on the methodologies and applications of this field, Fuzzy Multiple Objective Decision Making presents mathematical tools for complex decision making. The first part of the book introduces the most popular methods used to calculate the solution of MOP in the field of multiple objective decision making (MODM). The authors describe multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; expand de novo programming to changeable spaces, such as decision and objective spaces; and cover network data envelopment analysis. The second part focuses on various applications, giving readers a practical, in-depth understanding of MODM.\n\nA follow-up to the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Multiple Attribute Decision Making: Methods and Applications, this book guides practitioners in using MODM methods to make effective decisions. It also extends studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ knowledge of the methods and provides researchers with the foundation to publish papers in operations research and management science journals.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGwo-Hshiung Tzeng is a Distinguished Chair Professor at Kainan University.
