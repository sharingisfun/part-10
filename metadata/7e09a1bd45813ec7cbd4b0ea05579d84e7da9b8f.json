But great code doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just happen. It is the outcome of hundreds of small but critical decisions programmers make every single day. Now, legendary software innovator Kent BeckÃ¢â‚¬â€œknown worldwide for creating Extreme Programming and pioneering software patterns and test-driven developmentÃ¢â‚¬â€œfocuses on these critical decisions, unearthing powerful Ã¢â‚¬Å“implementation patternsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for writing programs that are simpler, clearer, better organized, and more cost effective.\n \nBeck collects 77 patterns for handling everyday programming tasks and writing more readable code. This new collection of patterns addresses many aspects of development, including class, state, behavior, method, collections, frameworks, and more. He uses diagrams, stories, examples, and essays to engage the reader as he illuminates the patterns. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find proven solutions for handling everything from naming variables to checking exceptions.\n \nThis book covers:\n\nÃ‚Â· The value of communicating through code and the philosophy behind patterns\nÃ‚Â· How and when to create classes, and how classes encode logic\nÃ‚Â· Best practices for storing and retrieving state\nÃ‚Â· Ã‚Â· Behavior: patterns for representing logic, including alternative paths\nÃ‚Â· Writing, naming, and decomposing methods\nÃ‚Â· Choosing and using collections\nÃ‚Â· Implementation pattern variations for use in building frameworks\n\nImplementation Patterns will help programmers at all experience levels, especially those who have benefited from software patterns or agile methods. It will also be an indispensable resource for development teams seeking to work together more efficiently and build more maintainable software. No other programming book will touch your day-to-day work more often.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e09a1bd45813ec7cbd4b0ea05579d84e7da9b8f","amp;dn":"Implementation+Patterns+by+Kent+Beck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e09a1bd45813ec7cbd4b0ea05579d84e7da9b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,9,161,189,69,129,62,199,203,212,176,234,5,87,157,132,231,218,155,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
