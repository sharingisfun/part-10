It was released in August of 1970. The album that launched Clapton's solo career takes most of its cues from his then-recent collaboration with Delaney and Bonnie. \n\nIn fact, Delaney produced the album, which explains its loose, jam-session feel that sometimes finds Clapton battling against a cast that includes guest stars Stephen Stills, Sonny Curtis, Rita Coolidge, Leon Russell, and Delaney and Bonnie. \n\nSadly, it's also Clapton's last good LP (@artpepper's opinion).\n\n\n\nI loved Clapton--from The Yardbirds to Cream to Blind Faith to the emotional hurricane that was Derek and The Dominoes. But after this LP, Clapton turned into an FM staple--music to do your laundry by. The fire, the passion, the edge--all gone. Which makes this LP all the more valuable.\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\n\n01.
