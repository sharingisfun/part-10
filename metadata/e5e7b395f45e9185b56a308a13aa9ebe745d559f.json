The text and figures are easy-to-follow, accurate, clear, and engaging for the introductory student. Molecular detail has been kept to a minimum in order to provide the reader with a cohesive conceptual framework for the basic science that underlies our current understanding of all of biology, including the biomedical sciences.\n\nThe Fourth Edition has been thoroughly revised, and covers the latest developments in this fast-moving field, yet retains the academic level and length of the previous edition. The book is accompanied by a rich package of online student and instructor resources, including over 130 narrated movies, an expanded and updated Question Bank, and new enhanced assessments for students.\n\n//\n\nHigh quality, fully searchable PDF.\nEnjoy!\n(thanks to the original uploader)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5e7b395f45e9185b56a308a13aa9ebe745d559f","amp;dn":"Alberts+-+Essential+Cell+Biology+%284th+ed.%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5e7b395f45e9185b56a308a13aa9ebe745d559f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,231,179,149,244,94,145,133,181,106,48,138,19,170,158,190,116,93,85,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
