By the way, you can use short syntax \\'=var\\' instead of \\'print(var)\\' to display variable\\'s value.\n3) Type os.exit() to close LuaJIT\n\nI believe this is good starter kit for beginners - minimal and essential simultaneously.  You should not read tons of literature - it is sufficient to learn only \\'Programming in Lua\\' (written by Lua\\'s author) and sometimes look into Lua manual www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ to get help on standard Lua functions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e939e94991f9ecc46043c6ca0e00e83d5ca65682","amp;dn":"Programming+in+Lua+2ed+%2B+LuaJIT+2+beta8+compiled+for+Win","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e939e94991f9ecc46043c6ca0e00e83d5ca65682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,57,233,73,145,249,236,196,96,67,198,202,14,0,232,61,92,166,86,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
