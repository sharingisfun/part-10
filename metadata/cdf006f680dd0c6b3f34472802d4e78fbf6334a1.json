As well as being a popular success,\n the record received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Like Oasis, Elastica managed to have a hit single in America \nwith &quot;Connection&quot;; the single was a major modern rock radio hit, as well as reaching the Top 100 on the singles chart.\n\n==============================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
