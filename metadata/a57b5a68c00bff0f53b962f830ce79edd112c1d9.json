Lincoln: A Biography By Ronald C. White Jr.\n\n2009 | 816 Pages | ISBN: 1400064996 | PDF | 11 MB\n\n\nEveryone wants to define the man who signed his name Ã¢â‚¬Å“A. Lincoln.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In his lifetime and ever since, friend and foe have taken it upon themselves to characterize Lincoln according to their own label or libel. In this magnificent book, Ronald C. White, Jr., offers a fresh and compelling definition of Lincoln as a man of integrityÃ¢â‚¬â€œwhat todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commentators would call Ã¢â‚¬Å“authenticityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œwhose moral compass holds the key to understanding his life.\n\nThrough meticulous research of the newly completed Lincoln Legal Papers, as well as of recently discovered letters and photographs, White provides a portrait of LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal, political, and moral evolution. White shows us Lincoln as a man who would leave a trail of thoughts in his wake, jotting ideas on scraps of paper and filing them in his top hat or the bottom drawer of his desk; a country lawyer who asked questions in order to figure out his own thinking on an issue, as much as to argue the case; a hands-on commander in chief who, as soldiers and sailors watched in amazement, commandeered a boat and ordered an attack on Confederate shore batteries at the tip of the Virginia peninsula; a man who struggled with the immorality of slavery and as president acted publicly and privately to outlaw it forever; and finally, a president involved in a religious odyssey who wrote, for his own eyes only, a profound meditation on Ã¢â‚¬Å“the will of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the Civil War that would become the basis of his finest address.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a57b5a68c00bff0f53b962f830ce79edd112c1d9","amp;dn":"A.+Lincoln%3A+A+Biography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a57b5a68c00bff0f53b962f830ce79edd112c1d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,123,90,104,192,11,255,15,83,185,98,248,48,206,121,237,209,18,193,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
