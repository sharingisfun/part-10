Not only does it contain Aretha's &quot;greatest&quot; hits it also features some of the best soul music ever created.\n\nThe purity of the young Aretha's voice on this collection is unequalled, there are many pretenders but no one will ever usurp the Queen of Soul title that is so rightfully hers.\nEvery track here is so stand out that it feels like an historic archive after all this time, each track will have particular significance to her fans, indeed it may well sound like a romantic/emotional autobiography for many.\nIn one of the greatest cliches (they really do have their uses for shorthand meaning) they really dont make music like this any more.\nAny fan will enjoy revisiting these classics, any newcomer (of whom I feel quite envious)must be entranced by the power of the song and its singer.\n\nI believe you can really never have too many Aretha albums, they are always excellent company and your task now, if you are reading this is to turn somebody new onto this goddess. Go on buy the album and gift it to somebody you love. Bet it works.
