The basis for Martin Scorcese's 1988 film of the same name, The Last Temptation of Christ stands alongside other frequently banned classics like The Satanic Verses as a brave and incisive reckoning between a religion's founding tenets and their more difficult implications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70bb6fd986e699a3ee9fb3ef14d5ef28ebea8c86","amp;dn":"The+Last+Temptation+of+Christ+by+Nikos+Kazantzakis+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70bb6fd986e699a3ee9fb3ef14d5ef28ebea8c86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,187,111,217,134,230,153,163,238,159,179,239,20,213,239,40,235,234,140,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
