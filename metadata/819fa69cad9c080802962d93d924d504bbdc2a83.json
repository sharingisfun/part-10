If this took him 15 years to rip-off, where are his supposedly magnificent brains? In addition to being an expression of his never ending turncoat attitude, it's filled with his current humanist mindset - AND, it's a complete rip-off from James George Frazer's old book &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; too, in other words nothing new here.\n\nAnyways, here's what is said of the book on Amazon.com, in case you care:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœSorcery and Religion in Ancient ScandinaviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the latest book from Varg Vikernes, one of the most controversial musicians of all time and the mastermind behind one of the most acclaimed black metal bands in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Burzum. Convicted in 1994 of the murder of band-mate Euronymous, Vikernes has since spent 15yrs studying the traditions and beliefs of the Ancient Scandinavians and their influence on modern Europeans. That research has culminated in a book in which the outspoken and often divisive author challenges many of the widely held views of contemporary culture and its history. The passionate and in-depth text provides an absorbing insight into the thoughts of this most notorious of musicians. Ã¢â‚¬ËœSorcery and Religion in Ancient ScandinaviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ makes fascinating reading and will be of interest not only to black metal and Burzum fans, but also to those with an interest in Norse mythology or European history and social commentators.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy, if you are able. And as always: If you like the book, please don't buy it - if you don't like it, spread it further so that other's don't either. He deserves no money.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:819fa69cad9c080802962d93d924d504bbdc2a83","amp;dn":"Varg+Vikernes+-+Sorcery+and+Religion+in+Ancient+Scandinavia.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"819fa69cad9c080802962d93d924d504bbdc2a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,159,166,156,173,156,8,8,2,150,45,147,217,36,213,4,187,220,42,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
