Having studied composition, orchestration, piano and musicology in his native Norway and the Netherlands, his Norwegian heritage, classical training and roots in the European/Russian orchestral repertoire is apparent in his work Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as is his talent for assimilating other styles and ethnic traditions. Ranging from the most intimate and delicate to massive orchestra and choir arrangements, all of Haugens film and video game releases have received major awards and nominations.\n\nAmong his best known works are the acclaimed orchestral scores for the Age of Conan series of video games: Hyborian Adventures (International Film Music Critics Association Awards winner, Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Game Audio Network Guild Awards and Ten Ton Hammer Best of the Decade Awards nominee), Rise of the Godslayer (Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Game Audio Network Guild Awards and Game Music Awards nominee), Savage Coast of Turan (Hollywood Music in Media Awards winner) and Secrets of DragonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spine (Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominee).\n\nMost recently, Haugen scored the stop-motion feature film Christmas in Pinchcliffe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the sequel to the classic Pinchcliffe Grand Prix, voted the most loved Norwegian film of all time. HaugenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score for his debut motion picture Fuck Up was nominated for an Amanda Award (Norwegian Film Awards).\n\nHaugen has composed music for grand occasions and events, like the World Ski Championships, the 200th Anniversary of the University of Oslo, the Oslo Opera Festival (for which he was also elected Festival Composer), the 200th Anniversary of NorwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s national poet, Henrik Wergeland, the Harpa Nordic Film Composer Awards and Spellemannsprisen (Norwegian music awards). His works have been performed at numerous concerts across Norway, Sweden and Germany by prominent orchestras and ensembles, among others the MalmÃƒÂ¶ Symphony Orchestra, the Norwegian Radio Orchestra, Trondheim Symphony Orchestra, GÃƒÂ¤vle Symphony Orchestra and choir, Dalasinfonietta and choir, the Oslo Philharmonic Choir and the Staff Band of the Norwegian Armed Forces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101fffdc61f6c4546560f65e2ce3d87f783d2214","amp;dn":"K.+A.+Haugen+-+Lords+Of+The+Fallen+OST+%282014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101fffdc61f6c4546560f65e2ce3d87f783d2214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,31,255,220,97,246,196,84,101,96,246,94,44,227,216,127,120,61,34,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
