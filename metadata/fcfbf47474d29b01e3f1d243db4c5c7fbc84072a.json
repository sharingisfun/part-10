It is the story that has been told, and in impressive and convincing detail, by John Stockwell, the former chief of the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Angola Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtask force.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ His book should not be missed. Since strategic thought survives by ignoring experience, it has a highly professional interest in avoiding accounts such as this. By the same token, all who are alarmed about the tendency toward such strategic thinking should strongly welcome Mr. StockwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€John Kenneth Galbraith, New York Review of Books\n\nIn Search of Enemies is much more than the story of the only war to be found when the CIA sought to recoup its prestige after the Vietnam debacle. Though no American troops were committed to Angola, only Ã¢â‚¬Å“advisors,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ many millions were spent, many thousands died, and many lies were told to the American people, in waging a war without purpose to American vital interests and without hope of victory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfbf47474d29b01e3f1d243db4c5c7fbc84072a","amp;dn":"In+search+of+enemies+-+a+CIA+story+-+John+Stockwell.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcfbf47474d29b01e3f1d243db4c5c7fbc84072a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,251,244,116,116,210,155,1,227,241,210,67,219,76,92,127,188,132,7,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
