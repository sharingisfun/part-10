Sort of a mix between candid camera and The Jamie Kennedy Experiment. It's a great and funny show.\n\nBest Of Season 1\nBest Of Season 2\nBest Of Season 3\n\n\nI downloaded the Best Of Seasons 1-3 already available (the 4.5 GB torrent) and I went to G-Spot to see what was taking up all the space. To my surprise, it wasn't the video...it was the audio at over 1500KBPS. That is rediculous.\n\nSo I extracted the audio using some program and got the audio down to 128kbps MP3 for each avi. I then removed the audio completely from the AVI's using virtualdub and then added back the 128kbps audio.\n\nThe Result? A lot less GBs in size. The video is untouched so it is the same quality. But the audio was taking up over half of that 4.45gb version which is really bogus. So now here is a more space friendly version. The audio seems great and I tested all 3 in VLC Media Player and they seem to be in sync.\n\nThis is my first video edit so please don't be too hard if something is wrong.\n\n\n\nVideo: \n\nXvid\nFPS: 19.980\nkbps: 889\n\nAudio:\n\n128kbps MP3 Joint Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f536bae9e6a9f29c668b5c2e970c5649443fd01","amp;dn":"Trigger+Happy+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f536bae9e6a9f29c668b5c2e970c5649443fd01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,83,107,174,158,106,159,41,198,104,181,194,233,112,197,100,148,67,253,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
