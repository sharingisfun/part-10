Taste\n02. Magnetic Baby\n03. Semi Precious Weapons\n04. Bleed To Heal\n05. Genius\n06. Her Hair Is on Fire\n07. That&amp;#039;s Kunt\n08. Jesus\n09. Time Zones\n10. Rock n Roll Never Looked So Beautiful\n\n\n\nThese guys rock. It feels as if you have stepped back three decades - Tranter is glam personified. The band builds his entrance; Dan Crean pounds away on the drums with not a hair of that uber-lacquered display falling out of place, whilst Cole Whittle and Aaron Lee Tasjan riff their hearts out. And they go on. And on.Tranter emerges onto the tiny stage by the help of a conveniently placed (but not-so-glam) chair. The band continue to riff as he lives up to his name, building the ultimate of entrances and proving that he is one hell of a showman. Resembling something of an Edwardian dandy misplaced in the future, Tranter is dressed in one of his infamous ensembles consisting of tights, endless ruffles and gravity-defying fuck-me boots. His make-up is superbly theatrical and he looks every inch of the glam rock superstar. Slowly turning to face the audience he bursts into the opening of rapidly-emerging favourite That&amp;#039;s Kunt and setting the precedent for how they mean to go on.\n-- Sarah Penny (http://www.musicomh.com/)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cd2bc1a23a9c9d84eba8cb969a2196edc6326bf","amp;dn":"Semi+Precious+Weapons+-+We+Love+You+%282008%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cd2bc1a23a9c9d84eba8cb969a2196edc6326bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,210,188,26,35,169,201,216,78,186,140,185,105,162,25,110,220,99,38,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
