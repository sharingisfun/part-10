Cheerio Chaps Cheerio Goodbye 4:38 \n\nRelease Notes: \n\nSally forth of a Saturday evening into any one of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \nmurderous provincial town squares; the smell of testosterone \nmingles with sweating lambÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flesh while punters duck into \ndive after dive as refugees pleading for sanctuary. What do \nyou see? A zoo? Wild Beasts see a ballet. \n\nIn Limbo, Panto this remarkable Leeds-via-Kendal four piece \npresent a kind of Songs Of Innocence And Experience for the \njuvenile male psyche; cataloguing its obsessions, its foibles \nand its transferred desires with a satiristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye for the \nabsurd and an artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye for the absurdly beautiful. \n\nWith lofty intent, then, the end justifies the frequently \nbewildering means: musically-speaking, Wild Beasts peddle an \nindecent but skilfully realised mix of village fete \ntomfoolery, Orange JuiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subtle melodicism and, in frontman \nHayden ThorpeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s divisive falsetto aneurisms, a diva croon to \nrival the oddball likes of Russell Mael and Billy McKenzie. \n\nWith tracks like early calling-card &amp;#039;Brave Bulging Buoyant \nClairvoyants&amp;#039;, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Club Of Fathomless LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“full with \nfierce, fathomless love / I spit and have spats to be roughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) \nWild Beasts drink deep of the youthful elixir and dole out \ndrubbings to the faces of their forefathers, only to find \nthemselves undone in ways that have plagued mankind since time \nimmemorial. Or not, as the case may be: Ã¢â‚¬ËœCheerio ChapsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a \ngrief-stricken music hall number examining what being shot out \nof a circus cannon will do for your wounded sense of male \npride (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I gloat with gritted grin / to cheat my chin into \nkeeping the womanly wibbling inÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). \n\nTo qualify a little: Limbo, Panto isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a perfect debut, but \nin terms of range and depth of ambition thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no new band in \nthe UK can hold a candle to Wild Beasts right now, save \nperhaps These New Puritans, and theirs feels a much more \nconsciously-willed autonomy, if no less valid. \n\nWhich isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to say our subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sound was merely stumbled \nupon; you can bet your bottom dollar there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a stroke on \nthis record that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t agonised over at length, and the band \nhas clearly striven to create a lasting impression in \neverything from the track listing up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ten songs in length, \ntwo previous singles left off (including the very fine \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœAssemblyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), signature hit tucked away at track nine with \nmuted arrangement, nary a furtive eye cast in the direction of \nthe indie disco. Even the titleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jarring vowel sounds trip \nawkwardly off the tongue. \n\nAnd if Limbo, PantoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening brace are an exhilarating \nclatter then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CrayonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that justifies the \napproach and provides the band with the masterstroke they were \nno doubt aiming at. ThorpeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obsessively alliterative ear as a \nlyricist can occasionally get the better of him but here he \nallows himself room to breathe, bassist Tom FlemmingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suave \ntenor giving emotional heft to the formerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impassioned cries \nthat Ã¢â‚¬Å“we are all so much moulded doughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while revelatory \nchords fire off around him. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pretty stunning moment. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe Old DogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a lovely, lilting duet that nonetheless \nsneaks lines as shocking and birth-traumatic as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a human is \nhauled from the wombÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wired jawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ under the radar, while \nhighlight Ã¢â‚¬ËœHis Grinning SkullÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ provides another moment where a \nsense of transgression is allowed to pierce the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \nrosy-cheeked vigour, an extraordinary tale of cuckoldry and \ngravedigging set to a stately shimmer of synth and guitar. \n\nA thrillingly uneven listen, all told, but what&amp;#039;s important is \nthat, like toddlers taking their first teetering steps, Wild \nBeasts are reeling in the instinctive knowledge theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve set in \nmotion an idea thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in their genes from birth, coursing \nfearless through learning limbs that seek out trauma as their \ncue to pick up the pen, the guitar or the microphone. As such, \nLimbo, Panto is shocking, funny, and above all irrevocable. \nExpect this lot to be around for the long haul.
