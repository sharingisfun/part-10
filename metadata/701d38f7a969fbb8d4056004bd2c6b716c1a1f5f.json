The pairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first release, the Broken Glass EP, arrived in February 2011; soon after, they made their live debut at the Vatican, performing the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Know ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s OverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the Basilica during a Mass. CatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Eyes played their first full-fledged concert and issued the Face in the Crowd EP in March, a few weeks before their self-titled debut arrived.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Cat's Eyes\n02.The Best Person I Know\n03.I'm Not Stupid\n04.Face In The Crowd\n05.Not A Friend\n06.Bandit\n07.Sooner Or Later\n08.The Lull\n09.Over You\n10.I Knew It Was Over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:701d38f7a969fbb8d4056004bd2c6b716c1a1f5f","amp;dn":"Cat%5C%27s+Eyes+-+Cat%5C%27s+Eyes+%282011%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"701d38f7a969fbb8d4056004bd2c6b716c1a1f5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,29,56,247,169,105,251,184,212,5,96,4,189,44,107,113,108,26,31,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
