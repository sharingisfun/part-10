It is the last Who album to feature bassist John Entwistle and drummer Kenney Jones, as well as the last to be released on Warner Bros. Records in the US. It was their last album until 2006's Endless Wire. It was released in 1982 on Polydor in the UK, peaking at #11, and on Warner Bros. in the US where it peaked at #8 on the Billboard Pop Albums charts. The US rights to both this album and Face Dances subsequently reverted to the band, who then licensed them to MCA Records (later Geffen Records, itself once distributed by WB) for reissue. The album achieved gold status by the RIAA in the US on November 1982.\n\n2011 reissue\n\nOn December 24, 2011 the original mix of the album was reissued in Japan in a miniature replica of the original album art work. The album was remastered by Jon Astley for this reissue using Direct Stream Digital (DSD) to transfer the digital files and included the bonus tracks added to the CD release of the album. The release was a limited edition in the SHM-CD format. The reissue included a picture of the original vinyl label.\n\n\n2011 Reissue Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Athena&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:46\n    &quot;It's Your Turn&quot; (John Entwistle) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n    &quot;Cooks County&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:51\n    &quot;It's Hard&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n    &quot;Dangerous&quot; (Entwistle) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n    &quot;Eminence Front&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:39\n    &quot;I've Known No War&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:56\n    &quot;One Life's Enough&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:22\n    &quot;One at a Time&quot; (Entwistle) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n    &quot;Why Did I Fall for That&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n    &quot;A Man Is a Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n    &quot;Cry If You Want&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:18\n    &quot;It's Hard&quot; LIVE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:56\n    &quot;Eminence Front&quot; LIVE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:37\n    &quot;Dangerous&quot; (Entwistle) LIVE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48\n    &quot;Cry If You Want&quot; LIVE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:12\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06cc3ff44ac543d37b068d5408b209edaa2f1c0a","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+It%27s+Hard+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06cc3ff44ac543d37b068d5408b209edaa2f1c0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,204,63,244,74,197,67,211,123,6,141,84,8,178,9,237,170,47,28,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
