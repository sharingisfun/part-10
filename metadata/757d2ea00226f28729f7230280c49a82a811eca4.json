Jackass characters Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville) and Billy (Jackson Nicoll) will take movie audiences along for the most insane hidden camera road trip ever captured on camera. Along the way Irving will introduce the young and impressionable Billy to people, places, and situations that give new meaning to the term &quot;childrearing&quot;. The duo will encounter male strippers, disgruntled child beauty pageant contestants (and their equally disgruntled mothers), funeral home mourners, biker bar patrons, and a whole lot of unsuspecting citizens. Real people in unreal situations, making for one really messed up comedy. \n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 1 Hour 32 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nVideo Properties\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 304\n\nFrame Rate: 23\n\nAudio Properties\n\nBit Rate: 158 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:757d2ea00226f28729f7230280c49a82a811eca4","amp;dn":"Bad+Grandpa%282013%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"757d2ea00226f28729f7230280c49a82a811eca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,125,46,160,2,38,242,135,41,247,35,2,128,196,154,130,168,17,236,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
