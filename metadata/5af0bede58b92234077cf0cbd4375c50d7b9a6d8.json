Heaven is not getting its fair share of business for the afterlife, so Lola (Victoria Abril), an angel who sings in a nightclub located beyond the pearly gates, is sent to Earth to drum up business by her boss, Marina (Fanny Ardant). Her first prospect is Manny (DemiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n Bichir), a prizefighter with an injury that could take his life at any time. As Lola tries to claim Manny's soul for the Lord, the wicked Jack Davenport (Gael GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Bernal) believes that the Devil deserves the boxer's soul, and he sends one of Hell's waitresses, Carmen (PenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lope Cruz), to seal the deal. On Earth, Lola takes the form of Manny's former love and urges him to mend fences with his mother, while seductive Carmen tries to persuade Manny to return to the ring, knowing that another fight would mean his death. While Lola and Carmen wage war over Manny's soul, they maintain their cover by working at a grocery store, where they both learn a few lessons about the pitfalls of earthly capitalism. Meanwhile, Manny is dealing with financial problems of his own -- he owes money to the city's corrupt police commissioner (Emilio GutiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rrez Caba), who is using his strong-arm men to &quot;persuade&quot; Manny to pay up.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Sin noticias de Dios.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.22 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1611 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 14.4 MiB\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1476 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.170\n      StreamSize : 1.11 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Video0 delay : 24ms\n      StreamSize : 96.7 MiB\n      Writing library : Lame 3.96.1\n      Coherency/PlayTime : 16855\n\nIMDB: tt0284491\n\nSpanish and English audio, English and Spanish (for the non Spanish audio) subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by fbdavis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af0bede58b92234077cf0cbd4375c50d7b9a6d8","amp;dn":"Sin+noticias+de+Dios+%28Don%5C%27t+Tempt+Me%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af0bede58b92234077cf0cbd4375c50d7b9a6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,240,190,222,88,185,34,52,7,124,240,203,212,55,92,80,215,185,166,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
