This small book is a gem. Black &amp; white pictures add to the famous artists quotes a wonderful perspective. You can also consider that these quotes add deepness and universality to the innovative approach of Paris caught by the photograph. Even if the photographs went after the writing of the quotes you could reasonably consider the quotes were made after the photographs. In short, buy this book, don't bring it with you in Paris. It would be useless. Offer it to the one you love (either a kid of a grand-ma) after you brought him or her to Paris.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0429cee72b9271d195b7835f355bbaa2033e612e","amp;dn":"Literary+Paris+%28Photo+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0429cee72b9271d195b7835f355bbaa2033e612e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,41,206,231,43,146,113,209,149,183,131,95,53,91,186,162,3,62,97,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
