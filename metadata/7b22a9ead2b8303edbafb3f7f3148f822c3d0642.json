Some taken from other torrents, some of my own. Rather than have lots of folders denoting every volume and disc, I've grouped the files in each folder by game, and the album tags are the same way. In the file tags, Disc #'s denote &quot;volume&quot; for Halo 2 and 4 - disc 3 tracks of H4 are the remixes on the &quot;deluxe&quot; version Volume 1 Disc 2. \n\nSorry if this is confusing, but I think it makes it easier to sort by album in a media player, rearrange CE or CEA, ODST, and Reach to your liking, and just hit play. Also, keeps me lazy since I don't have to make a playlist on my PMP.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b22a9ead2b8303edbafb3f7f3148f822c3d0642","amp;dn":"Halo+Discography+%28CE%2C+2%2C+3%2C+ODST%2C+Reach%2C+4%2C+CEA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b22a9ead2b8303edbafb3f7f3148f822c3d0642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,34,169,234,210,184,48,62,219,175,179,247,243,20,143,130,44,61,6,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
