Also includes Wildstorm one-shots, and crossovers, the Kev series, Keith Giffen and Grant Morrison's &quot;The Lost Year&quot;. I am also including the Armageddon/Revelations/Number of the Beast trilogy, which led into Authority Volume 5. This also includes all issues published to date in the current DC=New 52 version, which reverted back to the name Stormwatch. All thanks go to the original scanners, and (as usual) to my OCD.\n\nCheers, and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f439e4c23b92efd8005c5597958ac376b9d2e92e","amp;dn":"Stormwatch+-+The+Authority","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f439e4c23b92efd8005c5597958ac376b9d2e92e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,57,228,194,59,146,239,216,0,92,85,151,149,138,195,118,185,210,233,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
