James\n\nEpisode 187 - TACS begins poolside with Nick DiPaolo where Ant explains JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absence, they get into the latest details on the NY prison break and the possibility of it being turned into a movie, and discuss the pros and cons of the Supreme Court's ruling on same sex marriage. The guys then talk about the SpaceX explosion, technological advancements in space exploration, AntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upcoming 4th of July party, Donald Trump, media influence, destruction of history, and go through a few stories regarding the confederate flag. They talk about religion bashing, Dylann Roof, the death penalty, mermaid Siouxsie Q. James takes a seat spa side and explains how she got into the industry and into being a mermaid, they bring up Jaws, their stances on the sex industry, and Siouxsie sings a song about being an American whore. A stripped down Siouxsie goes for a dip while Ant and Nick listen to tape of asshat Al Sharpton hating, they pick apart Trump's views on illegal immigrants, Hillary Clinton not getting called out enough, an ISIS flag at a gay pride parade, and the NYPD being on high alert for July 4th. After DICIS makes an appearance, they talk about ISIS, ridiculous generalizations in racism, Amy Schumer, social media helping criminals, words speaking louder than actions, fascism, and the difference with news reporting and hotness between anchors. We see a new police brutality video, Nick and Ant talk about living theoretically versus what the fuck is really going on, they go through a news story about removing a Nathan Bedford Forrest statue, one on Diddy eating shit at the BET Awards, chat about military make outs, tolerance versus acceptance, they trash talk Radio Shack, Craig Schinkel calls in, and OT wraps discussing characters, racial humor, and feeling hurting weapons.\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16a81aa9b4a8d9a362012cfe2b7bb73dcdbcd410","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-06-29+Nick+DiPaolo+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16a81aa9b4a8d9a362012cfe2b7bb73dcdbcd410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,168,26,169,180,168,217,163,98,1,44,254,43,123,183,61,205,188,212,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
