A LOT OF THESE SCREENWRITING BOOKS LIKE TO FILL YOUR HEAD WITH FALSE PROMISES AND EASY TRICKS. BUT ITÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S SO DAMN FAR FROM THE OBVIOUS TRUTH: BECOMING A TALENTED WRITER TAKES A LONG TIME AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. \n\nTHEY ALSO CONVENIENTLY FORGET TO MENTION THAT THE ODDS ARE AGAINST YOU. THERE ARE OVER A MILLION SCRIPTS ALREADY FLOATING AROUND HOLLYWOOD. HULK HAS READ, OH... A COUPLE THOUSAND OF THEM. AND NEARLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON HULK MEETS IN THE FILM INDUSTRY ALREADY HAS A SCRIPT OF SOME SORT. NOT ONLY DOES THE SHEER VOLUME OF SCRIPTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH ONESELF IN THIS CLIMATE, BUT SO DOES THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ALREADY A VAST NUMBER OF TALENTED, PROFESSIONAL WRITERS IN NEED OF WORK. \n\nSO GIVEN ALL THESE CRIPPLING ODDS, WE SHOULD ALL JUST GIVE UP, RIGHT? WELL, NO. YOUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE NOT HERE READING THIS BECAUSE THAT REALITY BOTHERS YOU. AND THATÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S THE THING ABOUT THE MOVIES: THEYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE WONDERFUL. THEYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE THE IMAGINATION OF STORYTELLING MADE TANGIBLE. THEYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE OUR DREAMS MADE REAL. WHO WOULDNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T WANT TO BE A PART OF ALL THAT? \n\nFILM CRIT HULK WAS CREATED IN A CHAOTIC LAB EXPERIMENT INVOLVING GAMMA RADIATION, THE GHOST OF PAULINE KAEL, AND TELEPODS FOR SOME REASON. NOW HULK HAS A DEEP AND ABIDING LOVE OF CINEMA WHEREIN HULK RECOGNIZES THE INHERENT VALUES OF POPULAR, NARRATIVE, OR EXPERIMENTAL STYLES! \n\nTHROUGH A UNIQUE JOURNEY, HULK HAS ENDED UP WORKING IN HOLLYWOOD FOR OVER A DECADE AND NOW WRITES ABOUT CINEMA AND STORYTELLING IN THOROUGHLY HULK-SIZED FASHION. \n\nAND NOW YOU HOLD IN YOUR HANDS / HAVE ON YOUR SCREEN / WHATEVER IN YOUR WHATEVER, THE FIRST EBOOK BY FILM CRIT HULK. \n\nTHE ONLY THING IT MEANS TO BE IS HELPFUL. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1090722d3fa2ecba2785ba43de7f3555ff7641f4","amp;dn":"SCREENWRITING+101+by+Film+Crit+Hulk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1090722d3fa2ecba2785ba43de7f3555ff7641f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,144,114,45,63,162,236,186,39,133,186,67,222,127,53,85,255,118,65,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
