Drawing on a host of powerful new studies Gottman provides the tools you need to make your relationships thrive. \nIntroducing the empowering concept of the &quot;emotional bid,&quot; Gottman shows that all good relationships are built through a process of making and receiving successful bids. His simple yet life-transforming program shows listeners how to become master bidders by effectively turning toward others. He draws on the latest research to show listeners how the brain&amp;#039;s unique emotional command systems, as well as each person&amp;#039;s emotional heritage - their upbringing, life experiences, and enduring vulnerabilities - affect how they make and receive bids, and how to make adjustments. He then introduces a set of enjoyable and remarkably effective ways to deepen connections by finding shared meaning and honoring one another&amp;#039;s dreams. The final chapter offers specially tailored programs for life&amp;#039;s most important relationships: with lovers or spouses, children, adult siblings, friends, and co-workers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba69bc7a3ac73efb025f3b4544e353d496545532","amp;dn":"John+Gottman%2C+PhD_The+Relationship+Cure+%5BFull+Audiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba69bc7a3ac73efb025f3b4544e353d496545532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,105,188,122,58,199,62,251,2,95,59,69,68,227,83,212,150,84,85,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
