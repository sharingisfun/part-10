All of a sudden, the teachers start changing attitude. When Casey and Delilah have to hide in a closet in the teacher's lounge, they witness the strangulation of Nurse Harper by two of them. Shocked, they manage to flee. Only moments later, the nurse seems to be very alive, but also somehow changed, like all the teachers and most of the students. Only Casey, Delilah and four others seem to be suspicious. Proof of an alien infection is finally brought by the chemistry teacher, who also points out a way to kill the infected humans. The plan now is to get the queen, before the aliens can spread out over the whole country. \n\n===================================================================================\n\nRIPLOG\n\n\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] AutoGK 2.55\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] OS: WinXP (5.1.2600).2\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Job started.\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Input file: D:DVD-RipsThe FacultyVTS_01_0.IFO\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Output file: C:Documents and SettingsHidden UserDesktopThe Faculty.avi\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Output codec: XviD\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Audio 1: English AC3 6ch \n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Subtitles: none\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Format: AVI\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Target size: 700Mb\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Audio 1 settings: VBR MP3 with average bitrate: 112Kbps\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Started encoding.\n[22/12/2009 01:25:48] Demuxing and indexing.\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Processing file: D:DVD-RipsThe FacultyVTS_01_1.VOB\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Processing file: D:DVD-RipsThe FacultyVTS_01_2.VOB\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Processing file: D:DVD-RipsThe FacultyVTS_01_3.VOB\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Processing file: D:DVD-RipsThe FacultyVTS_01_4.VOB\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Processing file: D:DVD-RipsThe FacultyVTS_01_5.VOB\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Source resolution: 720x576\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Found PAL source.\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Source aspect ratio: 16:9\n[22/12/2009 01:51:05] Analyzing source.\n[22/12/2009 02:02:16] Source has percentage of interlacing in motion areas: 0.05\n[22/12/2009 02:02:16] Source is considered to be progressive.\n[22/12/2009 02:02:16] Output will contain 149951 frames\n[22/12/2009 02:02:16] Decoding audio.\n[22/12/2009 02:07:01] Normalizing audio.\n[22/12/2009 02:08:52] Encoding audio.\n[22/12/2009 02:27:21] Using VAQ in XviD\n[22/12/2009 02:27:21] Audio1 size: 77,140,091 bytes (73.57 Mb)\n[22/12/2009 02:27:24] Overhead: 5,998,080 bytes (5.72 Mb)\n[22/12/2009 02:27:24] Video size: 650,865,029 bytes (620.71 Mb)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:692b6a61c2c6af1f20468d642df4e326e3632bc8","amp;dn":"The+Faculty+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"692b6a61c2c6af1f20468d642df4e326e3632bc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,43,106,97,194,198,175,31,32,70,141,100,45,244,227,38,227,99,43,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
