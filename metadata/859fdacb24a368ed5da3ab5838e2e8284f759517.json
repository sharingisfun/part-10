Astral Weeks\n2. Beside You\n3. Sweet Thing\n4. Cyprus Avenue\n5. The Way Young Lovers Do\n6. Madame George\n7. Ballerina\n8. Slim Slow Slider\n\n\nASTRAL WEEKS is about the magic of improvisation, the suspended thrill of playing (and listening) on the cusp of discovery. In that way, the album is a perfect marriage of music and lyrics, as Van bends and twists the language in an effort to TRANSCEND the earthly significance of his words, to conjure a piece of heaven out of the frustration and pain that wracks his existence. Van fuses gospel and blues, the sacred and the profane. ASTRAL WEEKS is not a jazz album, but it certainly brandishes a jazz mentality: the triumph of feel over form, emotional release over craftsmanship. If you're searching for a true musical journey, in the truest sense of the word, then ASTRAL WEEKS is the apogee. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 42\nArtist: Van Morrison\nAlbum: Astral Weeks\nYear: 1968 [RE 2000]\nGenre: Folk/Pop/Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:859fdacb24a368ed5da3ab5838e2e8284f759517","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Astral+Weeks+%5BFLAC-1968%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"859fdacb24a368ed5da3ab5838e2e8284f759517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,159,218,203,36,163,104,237,93,163,171,88,56,226,232,40,79,117,149,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
