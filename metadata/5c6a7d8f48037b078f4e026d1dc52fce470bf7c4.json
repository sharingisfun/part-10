This eventually led to flying cities and fortresses. Due to an unspecified catastrophe (Probably a major storm), most of the flying cities were either destroyed or crashed back to the ground, forcing the survivors to live on the ground as before. One city, Laputa, is said to remain in the sky, concealed within the swirling clouds of a violent thunderstorm. While most people consider it to be fictional, some believe the legend is true and have sought to find the ancient city. Large airships still remain in common use.\n\nAboard a civilian airship, a young girl, Sheeta, is escorted to an unknown destination by sinister-looking agents under Colonel Muska. The ship is attacked by a group of sky pirates; in the resulting disorder, Sheeta takes a small pendant from Muska and escapes out the window. The sky pirates, led by an old but vivacious woman Dola, attempt to seize her and the pendant, but Sheeta accidentally falls from the ship. As she falls, the pendant radiates a blue light and she gently floats to the ground. A young boy miner, Pazu, witnesses this in amazement and catches Sheeta. He takes her back to his home, where she finds a photograph of Laputa. Pazu explains that his deceased father, an airship pilot and adventurer, took the photo, but was disbelieved by his contemporaries. Pazu believes the city exists, however, and wants to find it himself someday.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : Miyazaki - Laputa Castle in the sky.mkv \nFormat : Matroska \nFile size : 3.48 GiB \nDuration : 1h 59mn \n\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC \nDuration : 1h 59mn \nWidth : 1 280 pixels \nHeight : 688 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate : 25.000 fps \nScan type : Progressive \nID : 2 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nCodec ID : A_AC3 \nDuration : 1h 59mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 384 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 6 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nVideo delay : 28ms \nStream size : 328 MiB (9%) \nLanguage : Italian \nAudio #2 \nID : 3 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nFormat profile : Dolby Digital \nCodec ID : A_AC3 \nDuration : 1h 59mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 224 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nVideo delay : 18ms \nStream size : 191 MiB (5%) \nLanguage : German \nAudio #3 \nID : 4 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nCodec ID : A_AC3 \nDuration : 1h 59mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 384 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 6 channels \nChannel positions : \nFront: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nVideo delay : 22ms \nStream size : 328 MiB (9%) \nLanguage : Japanese \nAudio #4 \nID : 5 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nCodec ID : A_AC3 \nDuration : 1h 59mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 384 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 6 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nVideo delay : 22ms \nStream size : 328 MiB (9%) \nLanguage : Spanish \nAudio #5 \nID : 6 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nCodec ID : A_AC3 \nDuration : 1h 59mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 256 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : L R \nSampling rate :48.0 KHz \nVideo delay : 2ms \nStream size : 219 MiB (6%) \nLanguage : English \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c6a7d8f48037b078f4e026d1dc52fce470bf7c4","amp;dn":"Laputa+Castle+in+the+sky++%5BBDrip+720p+mkv+Ac3+ITA+SPA+DEU+ENG+JA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c6a7d8f48037b078f4e026d1dc52fce470bf7c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,106,125,143,72,3,123,7,143,78,2,109,29,197,47,206,71,11,247,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
