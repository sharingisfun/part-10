Won Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment - and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy.\n\nAfter having laughed at old and worn vhs tapes for years, we were pleasantly surprised when the dvd finally was released as widescreen with stereo sound.\n\nThis is not my rip, but it's good quality, burn tested, runs well in my DivX player.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:628e237c36f13db50fff5a08c0f32d56390f12b9","amp;dn":"A+Funny+Thing+Happened+on+the+Way+to+the+Forum+%281966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"628e237c36f13db50fff5a08c0f32d56390f12b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,142,35,124,54,241,61,181,15,255,90,8,192,243,45,86,57,15,18,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
