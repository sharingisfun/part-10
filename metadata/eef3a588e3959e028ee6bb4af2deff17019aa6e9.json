In the opening scene, a ten minute long tracking shot along a Ford factory floor, a narrator \n\nreads from The Communist Manifesto. This is followed by a woman wandering around her house naked while a narrator \n\nreads a feminist-tinged text, a news commentator reading a pro-capitalist rant that is repeatedly and abruptly cut off to \n\nshow workers that contradict his statements, and a group of young activists preparing protest banners while transposing \n\ncommunist propaganda to Beatles songs (&quot;You say Nixon/I say Mao&quot; to &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;). It closes with a fist repeatedly \n\npunching through a British flag. It&amp;#039;s a bold and assaultive socialist screed made during the director&amp;#039;s most divisive political \n\nperiod and was banned from television. Of note are the director&amp;#039;s experiments juxtaposing image, text, and sound.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : British Sounds (1970) DVDrip Xvid.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 568 MiB\n      PlayTime : 49mn 49s\n      Bit rate : 1586 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 6.05 MiB\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 49mn 49s\n      Bit rate : 1443 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 416 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.385\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.240\n      StreamSize : 514 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 49mn 49s\n      Bit rate : 134 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 47.9 MiB\n      Title : Audio\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0065494\n\nEnglish audio, Spanish subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eef3a588e3959e028ee6bb4af2deff17019aa6e9","amp;dn":"British+Sounds+%281970%29+-+Godard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eef3a588e3959e028ee6bb4af2deff17019aa6e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,243,165,136,227,149,158,2,142,230,187,74,242,222,255,23,1,154,166,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
