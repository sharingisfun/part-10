The visual tone poem contains neither dialogue nor a vocalized narration: its tone is set by the juxtaposition of images and music. In the Hopi language, the word Koyaanisqatsi means 'crazy life, life in turmoil, life out of balance, life disintegrating, a state of life that calls for another way of living', and the film implies that modern humanity is living in such a way.\n\nThe film is the first in the Qatsi trilogy of films: it is followed by Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002). The trilogy depicts different aspects of the relationship between humans, nature, and technology. Koyaanisqatsi is the best known of the trilogy and is considered a cult film. However, due to copyright issues, the film was out of print for most of the 1990s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5745ba9e25659ca8a2372d512826597a8e134b81","amp;dn":"KOYAANISQATSI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5745ba9e25659ca8a2372d512826597a8e134b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,69,186,158,37,101,156,168,162,55,45,81,40,38,89,122,142,19,75,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
