From the luminous colors of an idyllic childhood through the flamboyant hues of success and stardom, Cobain s story inevitably declines into a much darker palette. The script draws from the singer s tortured self-image as well as straightforward biographical fact so that the tone of the book fluctuates between subjective dream-state and objective reality. Going beyond the facts, it transmutes Cobain s extraordinary life into an equally extraordinary work of art. In full color throughout with amazing artwork by Flameboy.\nAbout the Author\nWriter Jim McCarthy is a widely published illustrator and comic strip artist and has created for Britain's best selling comic 2000AD \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Godspeed-Cobain-Graphic-Barnaby-Legg/dp/0711997632/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279641947&amp;sr=1-1-spell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Godspeed-Cobain-Graphic-Barnaby-Legg/dp/0711997632/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279641947&amp;sr=1-1-spell&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:486d0c6795e6649ba23dd1e4089fa3eed3d5b391","amp;dn":"Godspeed%3A+The+Kurt+Cobain+Graphic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"486d0c6795e6649ba23dd1e4089fa3eed3d5b391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,109,12,103,149,230,100,155,162,61,209,228,8,159,163,238,211,213,179,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
