Mastermind Kurt Wagner uses pop-country as a jumping-off point for the skewed, sardonic observations about life in these post-postmodern times, delivered in his wry, half-spoken baritone. Wagner's characters have a decidedly pulp fiction feel about them- -particularly the ones sketched in &quot;The Man Who Loved Beer&quot; and &quot;The Scary Caroler&quot;--and his bandmates provide suitably sepia-toned landscapes for said eccentrics to play out their stories. The seamless manner in which the players make offbeat instrumentation-- heavy on the trombone, lap steel, and banjo--sound so natural and kitsch-free is the icing on the cake, and a guarantee that you needn't be a hipster to appreciate Lambchop. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\npleaase seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11cdb12a43582b54b159cdcaf9f0327f538cdf5","amp;dn":"Lambchop...How+I+Quit+Smoking%281996%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11cdb12a43582b54b159cdcaf9f0327f538cdf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,28,219,18,164,53,130,181,75,21,156,220,175,159,3,39,245,56,205,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
