Nikki and Nora's unique perspective and sensibility make them perfect investigators for some of the tawdry and unsolved mysteries of the French Quarter, where secret identities threaten to betray carefully crafted public faces and key witnesses won't come forward without the delicate touch of the &quot;velvet hammer.&quot; Season One &quot;Music, Mayhem and Mothers&quot; takes Nikki and Nora into the underbelly of the New Orlean's music scene when they're hired to work on a case that puts them in the spotlight and the headlights. In the meantime, at home, Nikki and Nora tackle renovating their house while navigating the rising tide of resurfacing family issues.
