I couldn't find all of his works, but this torrent has a nice amount of them. A little over half. So I hope you all enjoy it!\n\n1998 - Gear\n1998 - Scud - Tales from the vending machine #3\n2003 - Creature Tech\n2004 - Tommysaurus Rex\n2006 - Iron West\n2008 - Monster Zoo\n2011 - Ratfist\n\nIf anyone has Power Up, Ghostopolis, or any of the other missing comics, it'd be great if you could drop a link in the comments.\n\n\nAnd as always, don't forget to seed, and most importantly, don't forget to support the artists! If you like it, buy it.\n\nAnd thank you to all the original scanners for making sharing of these files possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ef91aff6c586ec7870588a665df6358e0137a1d","amp;dn":"Comics+by+Doug+TenNapel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ef91aff6c586ec7870588a665df6358e0137a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,249,26,255,108,88,110,199,135,5,136,166,101,223,99,88,224,19,122,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
