Be AllahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s curse upon you!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThat was the message that hackers left on the website of FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s satirical weekly, Charlie Hebdo, after it announced plans to feature the Islamic prophet Muhammad as Ã¢â‚¬Å“editor-in-chiefÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of an upcoming issue. When the issue appeared last week, the publicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offices were firebombed and destroyed.\n\nCharlie HebdoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s editor, Stephane Ã¢â‚¬Å“CharbÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Charbonnier, was not cowed. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We no longer have a newspaper,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All our equipment has been destroyed or has melted. We cannot, today, put together a paper. But we will do everything possible to do one next week. Whatever happens, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do it. There is no question of giving in.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAlready there are calls for free people to surrender. Calls for self-censorship and greater Ã¢â‚¬Å“sensitivityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ toward Muslims have already begun. Bruce Crumley wrote in Time magazine in the wake of the bombing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious free societies cannot simply give in to hysterical demands made by members of any beyond-the-pale group,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that Ã¢â‚¬Å“intimidation and violence must be condemned and combated for whatever reason theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re committed,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but that Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just as evident members of those same free societies have to exercise a minimum of intelligence, calculation, civility and decency in practicing their rights and libertiesÃ¢â‚¬â€and that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happening when a newspaper decides to mock an entire faith on the logic that it can claim to make a politically noble statement by gratuitously pissing people off.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCertainly a decent person doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go around gratuitously angering people. But when it comes to censorship or even legislation, who is to decide what angers people gratuitously? The people in power, of course. Time is essentially calling for restrictions on the freedom of speech and the creation of a special, privileged class that is beyond criticism. That is the death of free society and the road to tyranny, for the class that is beyond criticism will have a free hand to do whatever it wants, and what will anyone be able to say?\n\n\nAbout the author:\nRobert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch, a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the author of eight books on Islam and jihad.
