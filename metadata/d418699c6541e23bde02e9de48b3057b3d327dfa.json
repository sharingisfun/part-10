Here it's set in Mexico and made by some of the greatest names in Mexican cinema, such as Emilio &quot;Victimas del Pecado&quot; Fernandez and Pedro Armendariz. They filmed it separately in English and Spanish, this is the English version. RKO was involved in a supporting role, and the picture has an RKO-ish look - compare The Leopard Man. The photography and storytelling are very dramatic, this has to be one of the best Steinbeck stories on the big screen.\n\nIn segmented mpg format, plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d418699c6541e23bde02e9de48b3057b3d327dfa","amp;dn":"The+Pearl+%281947%29+John+Steinbeck+Emilio+Fernandez+Pedro+Armendari","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d418699c6541e23bde02e9de48b3057b3d327dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,24,105,156,101,65,226,59,222,2,233,222,72,179,5,123,61,50,125,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
