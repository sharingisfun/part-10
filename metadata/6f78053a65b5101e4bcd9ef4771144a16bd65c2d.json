Dahlia trumps Bertie&amp;#039;s objections by threatening to sever his standing invitation to her house for lunch, an unthinkable prospect given Bertie&amp;#039;s devotion to the cooking of her chef, Anatole. A web of complications grows as Bertie&amp;#039;s pal Gussie Fink-Nottle asks for counseling in the matter of his impending marriage to Madeline Bassett. It seems Madeline isn&amp;#039;t his only interest; Gussie also wants to study the effects of a full moon on the love life of newts. Added to the cast of eccentrics are Roderick Spode, leader of a fascist organization called the Saviors of Britain, who also wants that cow-creamer, and an unusual man of the cloth known as Rev. H. P. &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker. As usual, butler Jeeves becomes a focal point for all the plots and ploys of these characters, and in the end only his cleverness can rescue Bertie from being arrested, lynched, and engaged by mistake!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f78053a65b5101e4bcd9ef4771144a16bd65c2d","amp;dn":"P.G.+Wodehouse+-+The+Code+of+the+Woosters%2C+Jeeves+to+the+Rescue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f78053a65b5101e4bcd9ef4771144a16bd65c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,120,5,58,101,181,16,30,75,205,158,244,119,17,68,161,107,214,92,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
