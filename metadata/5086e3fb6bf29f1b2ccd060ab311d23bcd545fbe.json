But his songs are certainly in a league with those of the other members, and it&amp;#039;s chiefly on his solo albums that Stills&amp;#039;s own personality comes through. Buffalo Springfield&amp;#039;s &quot;For What It&amp;#039;s Worth&quot; belongs to Stills, which shows where his influences lie. The hits &quot;Love the One You&amp;#039;re With&quot; and &quot;Sit Yourself Down,&quot; both of which live here, show how they developed. Sensitive? Lyrical? Not exactly. Think rugged denim, an acoustic guitar, and a woman at home to sew on his appliquÃƒÂ©s and pick the seeds out of the pot\n\n1. Love The One You&amp;#039;re With\n2. Do For The Others\n3.
