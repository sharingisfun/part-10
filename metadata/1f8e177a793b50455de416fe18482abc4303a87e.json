He was one of the best known musical\nartists of the 1950s and 1960s. Martin's hit singles included &quot;Memories Are Made Of This&quot;,\n&quot;That's Amore&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;, &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot;, &quot;Sway&quot;, &quot;Volare&quot; and &quot;Ain't\nThat A Kick In The Head?&quot; One of the organizers of &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;, he was a major star in\nfour areas of show business: concert stage, recordings, motion pictures, and television.\n\nBorn in Steubenville, Ohio, Martin dropped out of school in the 10th grade because he\nthought that he was smarter than his teachers. He delivered bootleg liquor, served as a\nspeakeasy croupier, wrote crafty anecdotes, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill\nand boxed as welterweight. At the age of 15, he was a boxer who billed himself as &quot;Kid\nCrochet&quot; (Kro-Shey). His prizefighting years earned him a broken nose (later fixed), a\npermanently split lip, and many sets of broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford\nthe tape used to wrap boxers' hands). He won just one of his 12 bouts.For a time, he\nroomed with Sonny King, who like Martin, was just starting in show business and had little\nmoney. Martin and King held bare-knuckle matches in their apartment, fighting until one of\nthem was knocked out; people paid to watch.\n\n\nYears active 1940-1989\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n  01.
