Comprising Robert Harvey (vocals, guitar), Adam Nutter (lead guitar), Stuart Coleman (bass) and Phil Jordan (drums), the band came to prominence with the release of their debut album, The Music, in 2002. The band released two further studio albums, Welcome to the North (2004) and Strength in Numbers (2008), before parting ways in 2011.\n\n\nThe Music all met at Brigshaw High School except Phil Jordan who went to Garforth and began playing in 1999 as Insense. In 2001 the song Take the Long Road and Walk It circulated as a demo before being released by Fierce Panda as a 1000-copies-only single, a rarity from its day of release. Around this time the NME and Steve Lamacq were describing them as the best unsigned band in Britain. The band were quickly signed by Hut, who released their first EP You Might as Well Try to Fuck Me.\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Music :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa3dae3cd4b25f4e3ca2d29ca9cf4e8397da05c3","amp;dn":"The+Music+-+Studio+Discography+2002+-+2008+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa3dae3cd4b25f4e3ca2d29ca9cf4e8397da05c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,61,174,60,212,178,95,78,60,162,210,156,169,207,78,131,151,218,5,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
