Fall Out Boy guitarist Joe Trohman calls him &quot;a musical genius, a mad scientist,&quot; while noted producer/performer Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds says, &quot;Patrick is one of the hottest dudes I've seen in a long time... He's got a great voice and a tremendous amount of talent.&quot; Fall Out Boy's fifth album, Folie a Deux, was released last December, producing the hit singles, &quot;I Don't Care&quot; and &quot;America's Suitehearts.&quot;\n\nStump puts that great voice straight to work, joining Daryl in a seven-song set highlighted by singles &quot;Out of Touch&quot; and &quot;Guessing Games,&quot; the latter from the H2O album. Among the Fall Out Boy songs Daryl and Patrick perform are versions of &quot;I Don't Care,&quot; &quot;What a Catch, Donny&quot; and &quot;Sugar, We're Goin Down&quot; along with a cover of Jimmy Ruffin's soul classic, &quot;What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda97406399423ffa22448d7cbc5c757d3adbade","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%5C%27s.House.E25.Patrick.Stump.WebRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda97406399423ffa22448d7cbc5c757d3adbade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,169,116,6,57,148,35,255,162,36,72,215,203,197,199,87,211,173,186,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
