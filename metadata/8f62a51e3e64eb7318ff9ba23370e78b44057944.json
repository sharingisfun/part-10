Here are some of the reasons for this:\n\n* Immediate Feedback. \nWith Onion Skinning you see what the animation is going to look like before you capture the frame.\n\n* Instant Playback.\nBecause the frames do not have to be processed, watch your animation right away to see if it worked out the way you wanted.\n\n* Get a Cue. \nInstead of creating a detailed X-sheet, load a real video, overlay it to the video input and use that as a guideline.\n\n* WYSIWYG. \nIf you use a greenscreen, the chroma keying in iStopMotion shows you what your frame will look like when recorded.\n\n* Remote Control.\nUse the Apple Remote to capture frames from a distance. This saves you travelling between your animation table and the computer keyboard.\n\n* Integration.\nSend your movies directly from iStopMotion Pro to Final Cut Pro.\n\nFits into Your Workflow\niStopMotion uses lossless compression to save individual frames into a QuickTime movie file. Use these files with the tools you already know, for example Final Cut Pro, for further editing in pristine quality. You can easily retouch single frames in an external image editing app such as Adobe Photoshop. When you save the image, iStopMotion automatically puts it back where it belongs. And finally build your very own customized control station by freely mapping the keyboard keys to any functionality you want.\n\n\nCompare Home, Express and Pro\n\niStopMotion Home\n- For the casual user, the typical family where the parents want to have fun with the kids while providing them with a productive, creative and educational experience.\n- Max. resolution: NTSC/PAL, 960 x 540 (Enough for YouTube videos and regular video DVDs)\n- Use video cameras and digital still cameras for shooting (See website for more information)\n- Stop motion single frame shooting\n- Time lapse recording\n- Tilt shift filter for making real live scenes look miniature\n- Onion skinning and blinking tools help you animate faster and more easily\n- Chroma-Keying lets you choose a complex background without having to build a set - choose from a number of enclosed backgrounds\n- Flip book printing lets you create old style paper flip books to show around\n- Send your video to iMove to add titles, intro, outro, music, transitions and more and upload to YouTube or burn to DVD\n\niStopMotion Express\n- The animation aficionado, who spends a lot of time creating animations and wants all the features of the Pro version except those only needed in a professional production environment.\n- Max. resolution: NTSC/PAL, 960 x 540 (Enough for YouTube videos and regular video DVDs)\n- All the features of iStopMotion Home, plus:\n- Continuous recording for taking small real time segments\n- Color correction by frame\n- Rotoscope/Lip Sync allows you to load a video file and use it as a guide for your animation\n- Import a soundtrack to animate to, for example for making a music video\n- Use your own background and foreground elements\n- Create your own project presets\n\niStopMotion Pro\n- The professional animator who uses iStopMotion in a production workflow, creating animations for commercials, music videos, feature movies in HD resolution and beyond.\n- Max. resolution: 10,000 x 10,000\n- All the features of the Express version, plus:\n- Integration with Final Cut\n- Support for HD capture\n\nMac App Store: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/istopmotion-pro/id409359163?mt=12#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/istopmotion-pro/id409359163?mt=12#&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions\n\n1.
