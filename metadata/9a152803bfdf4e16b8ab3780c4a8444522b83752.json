Rotated and cropped losslessly. Book not included.\nNotes.txt (which is simply these notes included in the torrent)\n\nThe review from AllMusic.com:\n\nAt nine discs and 244 tracks, The Complete Stax-Volt Singles: 1959-1968 is far too exhaustive for casual fans, but that's not who the set is designed for Ã¢â‚¬â€ it's made for the collector. Featuring every A-side the label released during those nine years, as well as several B-sides, the set is a definitive portrait of gritty, deep Southern soul. Many of the genre's major names Ã¢â‚¬â€ Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Carla Thomas, Booker T. &amp; the MG's, William Bell, Rufus Thomas, the Bar-Kays, Albert King Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus many terrific one-shot wonders are showcased in terrific sound and augmented with an in-depth booklet. For any serious soul or rock collector, it's an essential set, since Stax-Volt was not only a musically revolutionary label, its roster was deep with talent, which means much of the music on this collection is first-rate. But if you only want the hits, you'll be better off with a smaller collection, since too much of this set will sound too similar, and sorting through the nine discs will be a monumental task if you only want to hear Otis, Rufus, Carla, and Sam &amp; Dave.\n\nTo see the 244 tracks: &lt;a href=&quot; http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:tq5a8qmtbtq4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:tq5a8qmtbtq4&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a152803bfdf4e16b8ab3780c4a8444522b83752","amp;dn":"Complete+Stax-Volt+Singles%3B+1959-1968+%289+CDs%29+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a152803bfdf4e16b8ab3780c4a8444522b83752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,21,40,3,191,223,78,22,184,171,55,128,196,168,68,69,34,184,55,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
