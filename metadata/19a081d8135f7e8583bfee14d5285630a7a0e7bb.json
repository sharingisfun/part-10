Wollstein\n\nJoan Crawford is her usual upwardly mobile self in this melodrama co-starring Clark Gable. She plays Marian Martin, a cynical small-town girl determining to give up the idea of marriage. Kept by wealthy attorney Mark Whitney (Gable), Marian assumes a new identity as a divorced woman of the world, but her newfound life of luxury comes crashing down when Mark decides to run in the gubernatorial race. A rival leaks her real identity and Marian is forced to defend herself at one of Mark's election rallies. Her story brings the crowd to tears, however, and a relieved Mark proposes marriage. Based on a 1920 play by Edgar Selwyn, Possessed had been filmed previously in 1924 as The Mirage, a vehicle for silent star Florence Vidor.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022276/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022276/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\tJoan Crawford\t... \tMarian Martin\n\n\tClark Gable\t... \tMark Whitney\n\tWallace Ford\t... \tAl Manning\n\tRichard 'Skeets' Gallagher\t... \tWally Stuart (as Skeets Gallagher)\n\tFrank Conroy\t... \tHorace Travers\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:16:02\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 656x480\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1154 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nEnjoy!Please Help Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19a081d8135f7e8583bfee14d5285630a7a0e7bb","amp;dn":"Possessed+%281931%29+Joan+Crawford+Clark+Gable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19a081d8135f7e8583bfee14d5285630a7a0e7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,160,129,216,19,95,126,133,131,191,238,20,213,40,86,48,167,160,231,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
