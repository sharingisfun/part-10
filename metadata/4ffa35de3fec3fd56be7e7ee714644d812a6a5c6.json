This is not a very ambitious book, being basically a beautifully produced catalogue of 28 large (up to 190cm/6ft)free-standing Igbo figure scultures. The pieces are well-selected from various private European collections, and are not commonly reproduced in tribal art books, which tend to concentrate on masks and smaller figures from the Igbo tribe. These large, often life-size works, displaying many of the scarification, coloring and facial features familiar from Igbo masks, must be truly imposing when seen in real life. Very nice presentation, good paper and fine photography throughout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ffa35de3fec3fd56be7e7ee714644d812a6a5c6","amp;dn":"IGBO+-+Monumental+Sculptures+From+Nigeria+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ffa35de3fec3fd56be7e7ee714644d812a6a5c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,250,53,222,63,236,63,213,107,231,231,238,113,70,68,216,18,166,165,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
