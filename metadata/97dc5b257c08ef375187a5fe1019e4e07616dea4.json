At least one critic was not thrilled.\n\n\n\nHere are 12 duets by 2 very expressive musicians plucking a total of 10 strings\n\nin pleasant ways and at the &quot;proper&quot;* times.  In so doing they create ethereal\n\nmoods.  I enjoy this as much as HANCOCK/SHORTER 1+1....very good company\n\n\nThe original album has 13 tracks but #13 had physical defects.  #12 provides\n\nas good an ending.  An option is to buy the CD and then hear the intended\n\nconcluding track.  Both musicians are from Missouri (USA) hence the title.\n\n\nTo increase further the strangeness I've included (2) low quality photos.\n\n(#1)an unflattering pic of the duo and(#2)a pic of the jewel case/back cover with\n\nscratch marks to indicate my favorite tracks. \n\n\n\n*the word PROPER is really not proper in this context; could &quot;proper&quot; music\n\n be any good?  I'm thinking improper music would be a better choice most of the \n\n time....less predictable.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97dc5b257c08ef375187a5fe1019e4e07616dea4","amp;dn":"Charlie+Haden%2FPat+Metheny%2C+BEYOND+THE+MISSOURI+SKY%2C+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97dc5b257c08ef375187a5fe1019e4e07616dea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,220,91,37,124,8,239,55,81,135,165,254,16,25,228,224,118,22,222,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
