A highly reliable\n  database platform for mission-critical applications, SQL Server 2005\n  delivers high levels of availability and performance with enhanced security\n  features. Although Developer Edition supports all the features of Enterprise\n  Edition that allow developers to write and test applications that can use\n  the features, Developer Edition is licensed for use only as a development\n  and test system, not as a production server.\n\n  Notes: Visual Studio 2005 Rro does carry SQL 2005 but its only a SQL Server\n  2005 express edition.The SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition DVD itself is \n  over 2.8GB. It obviously has something that vs 2005 doesnt.\n\n\n  Have a good weekends.drink and high, hangover and die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b1169194fae494427e18fbc9a34dda726ee645","amp;dn":"SQL+Server+2005+Developer+Edition+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b1169194fae494427e18fbc9a34dda726ee645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,177,22,145,148,250,228,148,66,126,24,251,201,163,77,218,114,110,230,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
