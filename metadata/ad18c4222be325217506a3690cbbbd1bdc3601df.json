Tatler\n\nThis is a masterful romp through the bizarre world of coffee and caffeine, especially caffeine. Mr. Carpenter has succeeded in writing a book that will have lasting impact and change the way we regard our coffee habit. By isolating caffeine as simply a white powder additive, he provoked me to reevaluate my &quot;light and favorable addiction&quot;. Would I drink coffee without caffeine? Hell no! I never liked decaf. In my enthusiasm for this marvelous book, and despite being only half way through, I wanted to be sure to let people know that just the first half would be worth the price. Innovative, comprehensive and always interesting! Very well done, Mr. Carpenter! (NOTE: Completed the book and, yes, it was excellent!)[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad18c4222be325217506a3690cbbbd1bdc3601df","amp;dn":"Caffeinated+by+Murray+Carpenter+8-CD+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad18c4222be325217506a3690cbbbd1bdc3601df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,24,196,34,43,227,37,33,117,6,163,105,12,187,189,27,220,54,1,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
