The book was originally published here in 1972 and was hailed by James Beard as &quot;a landmark in the field of cookery&quot;; this new version represents the accumulation of the author's thirty years of further extensive travel throughout the ever-changing landscape of the Middle East, gathering recipes and stories.\n\nNow Ms. Roden gives us more than 800 recipes, including the aromatic variations that accent a dish and define the country of origin: fried garlic and cumin and coriander from Egypt, cinnamon and allspice from Turkey, sumac and tamarind from Syria and Lebanon, pomegranate syrup from Iran, preserved lemon and harissa from North Africa. \n\nShe has worked out simpler approaches to traditional dishes, using healthier ingredients and time-saving methods without ever sacrificing any of the extraordinary flavor, freshness, and texture that distinguish the cooking of this part of the world.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Cooking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae2906e4ccd56cbdbf679147f5bc291bc64cda4b","amp;dn":"The+New+Book+of+Middle+Eastern+Food+by+Claudia+Roden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae2906e4ccd56cbdbf679147f5bc291bc64cda4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,41,6,228,204,213,108,189,191,103,145,71,245,188,41,27,198,76,218,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
