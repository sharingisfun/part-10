The star plays a zaftig German peasant girl who becomes a nude model (anything to get her out of those ill-fitting 1890s costumes!) She falls in love with a struggling sculptor (Brian Aherne), but her ambitions get the better of her and she marries a hedonistic baron (Lionel Atwill). Leaving her husband, Dietrich sinks further down the social scale by becoming a cabaret singer. She is eventually reunited with the sculptor, but not before smashing the nude statue based on her voluptuous frame, thereby symbolically purging her checkered past. Song of Songs was based on a Herman Sudermann novel, previously adapted into a stage play and then filmed twice during the silent era. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024598/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024598/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:26:14\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x528 4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 2145 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,24 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8553e46366a266ee9b7d382c26f4e10424870acd","amp;dn":"The+Song+of+Songs+%281933%29+Marlene+Dietrich+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8553e46366a266ee9b7d382c26f4e10424870acd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,83,228,99,102,162,102,238,155,125,56,44,38,244,225,4,36,135,10,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
