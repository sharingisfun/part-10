Yet, many people do not know that drinking red wine protects the heart more than white wine, while beer, margaritas, and hard liquor are less effective in providing such protection. And while alcoholism is a serious problem requiring medical and psychological treatment, for those who are not addicted, drinking alcohol is not necessarily a bad habit. The problem is to distinguish between drinking sensibly and drinking insensibly. Dasgupta clearly outlines what constitutes healthy drinking and its attendant health benefits, offers advice on how to drink responsibly, and provides insight into just how alcohol works on the brain and the body. After reading this book, readers will enjoy their next drink with a fuller and safer understanding of why they're enjoying it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca94c2f40c8c87ad6ab762eabd10bd48fe4000c","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Drinking%3A+How+Alcohol+Affects+Your+Body+and+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca94c2f40c8c87ad6ab762eabd10bd48fe4000c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,169,76,47,64,200,200,122,214,171,118,46,171,209,11,212,143,228,0,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
