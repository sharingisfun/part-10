The series takes place at the Shady Rest Hotel, which is run by Kate Bradley, her Uncle Joe Carson, and her three daughters Billie Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Betty Jo Bradley. The series is one of three interrelated shows about rural characters created by Paul Henning. Petticoat Junction was created upon the success of Henning's previous rural/urban-themed sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies (1962â€“1971). The success of Petticoat Junction led to a spin-off, Green Acres (1965â€“1971). Petticoat Junction was produced by Wayfilms (a joint venture of Filmways Television and Pen-Ten Productions).\r\n\r\nOver a period of a year or two I have searched for Petticoat Junction TV show torrents. A few days ago, I finally got to the point where I was only missing episodes 10 and 12 from season 4. I rather reluctantly tried to find them on YouTube and was pleasantly surprised to find them! So now, after half a day of verifying and editing the file names to my satisfaction, I am finally able to upload the entire TV series. Hopefully, there are no errors. Please enjoy this great show!\r\n\r\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9616a24fb8cecaf05837160b7e75fde64f85d8cd","amp;dn":"Petticoat+Junction+%281963-1970%29+-+7+Seasons+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9616a24fb8cecaf05837160b7e75fde64f85d8cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,22,162,79,184,206,202,240,88,55,22,11,126,117,253,230,79,133,216,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
