But rarely do we hear about a full-fledged family unit embarking down the treacherous path of a musical career. In the case of Texas based Mothership, the Brother Juett (Kyle on bass, younger brother Kelley on guitar) enlisted the aid of their father, John Juett, to help get the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœship off the ground. Raised on a healthy dose of their fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s-era record collection, the brothers began crafting songs fueled on the raucous and raw good time vibe when music seemed to know no bounds. Lifting off the pad for the first time in 2010, the band began to gain momentum and notoriety with their unabashed live shows.\n\n\nKnowing that the service of the family patriarch was temporary, Father Juett actively helped his boys find his replacement, and in late 2011, enter the mighty Judge Smith to hammer away on the skins.\n\n\nIn early 2012, Mothership entered Crystal Clear Studios with Wo Fat mastermind Kent Stump manning the boards and by mid-year, the band self-released their debut album. It was the combination of the 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s-era heavy rock fuzz and fury mixed with the blistering guitar solos of the NWOBHM-era that drew the bands attention to California-based Heavy Rock label, Ripple Music. In the waning months of 2012, after a successful year of traveling regionally throughout Texas and opening for national acts such as Prong, Red Fang, Gypsyhawk, Monster Magnet, and Lo-Pan, Mothership officially dubbed Ripple Music as its Home Port. With the official Ripple Music release of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut record in February of 2013, Mothership began a torrid journey across America and parts of Canada to promote the record, including a tour in support of Gyspyhawk and another in support of Scorpion Child and Kadavar. Currently, the band is holed up in the studio working on new material and plotting a course across Europe in Spring of 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the heavy rock galaxy, otherwise known as Texas, Mothership has landed again to blow up your speakers and turn your brain to mush with their second album, appropriately titled, II. It's another thundering psycho, stoner, proto-metal romp around the block.\n\n\n\nThere's many things to like about Mothership, not the least of which is that they eschew modern rock conventions. There's nothing hardcore or harsh about their music. Heavy, yes, with a thick, woofer busting, bottom end from that rhythm section. If it weren't for the subtle melody, equally thick rock groove, sometimes some speed, and those warped out guitar lines, this album would be only good for scaring a third world dictator out of his palace.\n\n\nFor thumping monster songs you have Priestess of the Moon, Holy Massacre or Serpents Throne, for example, all of which pummel with a desert rock thunder. Mothership could give everybody from QOTSA to Lonely Camel to early Sabbath a significant beat down. Alternatively, Mothership can rock with the best. Shanghai Surprise is one grooviest, heaviest, and toe-tapping numbers you'll find, also wrapped in a faster pace. So also is the bass and riff driven Hot Smoke and Heavy Blues. It's groove, blues, and flurry rolled into one song, and the guitar flies wildly. Then, maybe just to throw you off, the band offers Tamu Massif (an underwater volcano named after Texas A&amp;U, and the French word for large mountain). It's marked by the deep rhythm section, but more relaxed and subtle, with lots of tasty guitar wizardry from Kelley Juett. Call it proto progressive heavy rock. Eye Of Sphinx also moves a bit differently. It's mostly laid back in the early quarter, but builds with churning riffs undergirded by restless drums to a crescendo.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's easy to listen to any Mothership album and hear only 'heavy' when there's actually much more going on throughout. Yeah, sure, you can get bogged down at times in the ominous rhythm section and wall of riffage but, ultimately, Mothership will mix things up and keep you interested. Mothership II is a fine second effort from the band and easily recommended.\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nMothership      2013\nMothership II      2014\n\n \n\nLine-Up:\nKyle Juett: Vocals, Bass\nKelley Juett: Vocals, Guitar\nJudge Smith: Drums\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Mothership\nAlbum: Mothership II\nGenre: Stoner Metal\nSubGenre:  Traditional Rock\nCountry Of Origin: USA\nYear: 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: CBR 320kbps\nSize: 127 Mb\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 Celestial Prophet\n02 Priestess Of The Moon\n03 Shanghai Surprise\n04 Holy Massacre\n05 Centauromachy\n06 Hot Smoke And Heavy Blues\n07 Tamu Massif\n08 Astromancer\n09 Serpents Throne\n10 Eye Of Sphinx\n11 Good Morning Little School Girl\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre:\tStoner\nSubgenre:\tTraditional Rock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t126.97 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79028c88c367742b02a60dfc38dfca2f2d8c6b9","amp;dn":"Mothership+-+Mothership+II+%282014%29+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79028c88c367742b02a60dfc38dfca2f2d8c6b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,144,40,200,140,54,119,66,176,42,96,223,195,141,252,162,242,216,198,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
