Aurelio Zen (Rufus Sewell, John Adams) is a formidable detective, but he's always put honesty before advancement. The arrival of clever and ambitious Tania (Caterina Murino, Casino Royale) to the team sees Zen's vigor reawakened. Driven by romance, re-energized and armed with a new confidence, Zen's investigations take him from crowded Rome to the spectacular Italian countryside, as he negotiates a complex string of murder cases, never afraid to question authority or use a few unorthodox methods to see justice done. Rufus Sewell brings passion, intrigue and humor to author Michael Dibdin's character in this series set against a visually rich backdrop of Rome at its most stunning. \n\n\nZen.S01.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS\n\n624Ãƒâ€”352 25fps XviD ~1000kbit | English MP3 128kBit | 700MB x 3ep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf55c82481cbe59b5650a6b74e43d18c784821fa","amp;dn":"Zen+-+Season+1+%282011.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf55c82481cbe59b5650a6b74e43d18c784821fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,85,200,36,129,203,229,155,86,80,166,183,78,67,209,140,120,72,33,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
