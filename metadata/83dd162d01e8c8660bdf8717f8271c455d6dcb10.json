In 2005, the ERS School started \nthe very ambitious HERMES (Harmonised Education in Respiratory Medicine \nfor European Specialists) project. Since then, seven HERMES Task Forces \nhave formed to standardise training and education within different specialties \nof respiratory medicine. To support the implementation of various educational \nactivities, the ERS has produced a series of Handbooksas educational tools, with \nthe ERS Handbook of Respiratory Medicinebeing the first textbook to be launched \nin 2010.\nStarting in 2007, the Paediatric Respiratory Medicine Task Force, using a formal \nconsensus process and working with numerous experts throughout Europe, \ndeveloped a HERMES syllabus (description of the competencies required) and \na HERMES curriculum (description of how competencies should be taught, \nlearned and assessed), as well as a voluntary European examination in paediatric \nrespiratory medicine. With the paediatric HERMES project now well underway, \nit is an opportune time to publish an ERS Handbook of Paediatric Respiratory \nMedicineto provide a comprehensive update for specialists within this field of \nrespiratory medicine. The content of this Handbookfollows the HERMES syllabus \nand curriculum to provide a compact, state-of-the-art textbook, with each of the \nsections prepared by senior specialists and clinical experts in the field.\nWe hope that this Handbookwill not only inform our trainees but also provide an \neasily accessible and comprehensive update for colleagues at all levels of seniority \nacross paediatric respiratory medicine. Thus, this educational tool is intended \nto make a significant contribution to increasing the standards of training in \npaediatric respiratory medicine throughout Europe and, ultimately, to improving \nthe care of children with respiratory disease.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83dd162d01e8c8660bdf8717f8271c455d6dcb10","amp;dn":"ERS+Handbook+of+Paediatric+Respiratory+Medicine+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83dd162d01e8c8660bdf8717f8271c455d6dcb10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,221,22,45,1,232,200,102,11,223,135,23,248,39,28,69,93,109,203,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
