In a situation when your life depends on it, you need to put your prejudices aside to keep your stomach filled and your strength up.\n\nWhether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mastering the art of foraging and cooking up a tasty feast around the campfire or learning about the more extreme end of wild food (ever tried a scorpion kebab?), thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot to learn when it comes to dinner time in the wild. Extreme Food will teach you all the necessary skills and techniques to get your teeth into meals you might never have thought of as food in the first placeÃ¢â‚¬â€and, crucially, how to recognize plants and animals that might end up doing you more harm than good.\n\nIn todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, we rarely need to venture beyond the local supermarket and we turn our noses up at the thought of snacking on bugs and grubs. But out in the wild, Mother Nature has provided us with a plentiful supply of nutritiousÃ¢â‚¬â€if not always deliciousÃ¢â‚¬â€food for the taking. And when needs must, we just have to know where to look.\n\nSome of it might take you out of your comfort zone. Some of it might turn your stomach. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saved my life more than once. And one day, it might save yours . . .Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€BEAR GRYLLS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d039d00a5f7133414a72be81fb7747f084872a7","amp;dn":"Extreme+Food%3A+What+To+Eat+When+Your+Life+Depends+On+It+-+Bear+Gr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d039d00a5f7133414a72be81fb7747f084872a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,3,157,0,165,247,19,52,20,167,43,232,31,183,116,127,8,72,114,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
