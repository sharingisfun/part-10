That itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply - but that almost seems beside the point now. Maybe that was always beside the point. Two days before theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re supposed to visit NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a TV writer, and somethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her - Neal is always a little upset with Georgie - but she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect to him to pack up the kids and go without her. When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finally done it. If sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruined everything. That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts. Is that what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to do?
