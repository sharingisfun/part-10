In this thrilling exploration, Pitre shows how the suffering and death of Jesus was far more than a tragic Roman execution. Instead, the Passion of Christ was the fulfillment of ancient Jewish prophecies of a wedding, when the God of the universe would wed himself to humankind in an everlasting nuptial covenant.\n \nTo be sure, most Christians are familiar with the apostle PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teaching that Christ is the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBridegroomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the Church is the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. But what does this really mean? And what would ever possess Paul to compare the death of Christ to the love of a husband for his wife? If you would have been at the Crucifixion, with Jesus hanging there dying, is that how you would have described it? How could a first-century Jew like Paul, who knew how brutal Roman crucifixions were, have ever compared the execution of Jesus to a wedding? And why does he refer to this as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“great mysteryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ephesians 5:32)?\n \nAs Pitre shows, the key to unlocking this mystery can be found by going back to Jewish Scripture and tradition and seeing the entire history of salvation, from Mount Sinai to Mount Calvary, as a divine love story between Creator and creature, between God and Israel, between Christ and his brideÃ¢â‚¬â€a story that comes to its climax on the wood of a Roman cross.  \n \nIn the pages of Jesus the Bridegroom, dozens of familiar passages in the BibleÃ¢â‚¬â€the Exodus, the Song of Songs, the Wedding at Cana, the Woman at the Well, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and even the Second Coming at the End of TimeÃ¢â‚¬â€are suddenly transformed before our eyes. Indeed, when seen in the light of Jewish Scripture and tradition, the life of Christ is nothing less than the greatest love story ever told.\n\n---\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;This book will change you. It is an invitation to the Messiah's wedding feast--and a foretaste of heaven. It will change the way you experience the sacraments, personal prayer, Scripture study, and marriage. Most of all, it will deepen your love for Christ.&quot; - Scott Hahn, author of The Lamb's Supper and Signs of Life.\n\n&quot;Brant Pitre has a wonderful gift for blending insight, scholarship, and an elegant, appealing style. The result is an extraordinary encounter with Jesus Christ, the meaning of his mission, and the spousal nature of God's love for humanity and Christ's love for the Church.&quot; - Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Capp., Archbishop of Philadelphia\n\n&quot;Brant Pitre helps us to know Jesus not just as a Savior and lord, but as our divine bridegroom. This excellent book show how the theme of Christ the bridegroom is at the very heart of salvation history and how it can transform the way we view baptism, the Eucharist, marriage, and our own relationship with Christ. The profound Biblical insights and clear, engaging writing style will take you deeper into the divine love story found in Sacred Scripture.&quot; - Edward Sri, author of Walking with Mary\n\n&quot;With his customary combination of deep erudition and clarity of expression, Brant Pitre sheds light on a central theme of the New Testament:  Jesus as the incarnation of the God who wants to marry his people.  In the course of elaborating this motif, Pitre offers wonderfully fresh readings of the Wedding Feast of Cana, the Woman at the Well, the Last Supper, and the Crucifixion.  His interpretation of the Passion as the consummation of the spousal relationship between Jesus and his people is simply stunning.  This is a book that will appeal to both the scholar and the ordinary believer, indeed to anyone interested in understanding Jesus Christ more profoundly.&quot; - Father Robert Barron, founder of Word on Fire and author of Catholicism\n\n---\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBrant Pitre is a professor of sacred Scripture at Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the bestselling author of Jesus, the Tribulation, and the End of Exile and Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist.
