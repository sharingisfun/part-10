Beyond simply obeying laws, this book focuses on leading an aggressively dynamic life, giving examples of proper and improper attitudes, conduct, and characteristics in succinct, penetrating ways. A proverb can be thought of as ''a short sentence from long experience''; it is easy to remember, yet it condenses much wisdom into a small space.\n\n''All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable'' in four ways: for doctrine - whats right; for reproof - whats not right; for correction - how to get right; and for instruction in righteousness - how to stay right (2 Timothy 3:16). This book touches on all four of these. \n\nThis is a 8 DivX set containing the following 8 sessions:\n\n    * Proverbs Session 1 - Chapters 1-4 - Introduction. Wisdom and Folly.
