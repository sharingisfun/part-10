It was dubbed &quot;The Factory&quot; by drummer Doug &quot;Cosmo&quot; Clifford, due to the fact that bandleader John Fogerty made them practice there almost every day.\n\n\nformat mp3 320\n\n\nSide one \t\n \t\n1. \t&quot;Ramble Tamble&quot;   \t                7:09\n2. \t&quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;  \t        3:24\n3. \t&quot;Travelin' BandÃ¢â‚¬Â¡&quot;   \t                2:07\n4. \t&quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;                \t        2:05\n5. \t&quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door&quot;   \t        2:31\n6. \t&quot;Run Through the JungleÃ¢â‚¬Â &quot;   \t        3:09\nSide two \t\n \t\n1. \t&quot;Up Around the BendÃ¢â‚¬Â &quot;   \t        2:40    \n2. \t&quot;My Baby Left Me&quot;  \t                2:17\n3. \t&quot;Who'll Stop the RainÃ¢â‚¬Â¡&quot;   \t        2:28\n4. \t&quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;  \t11:05\n5. \t&quot;Long as I Can See the Light&quot;   \t3:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435cc889536fdfdb968a20c3a141efbef1330e61","amp;dn":"CCR-+Cosmos+Factory+%5B1970%5D+320+kbps.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435cc889536fdfdb968a20c3a141efbef1330e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,92,200,137,83,111,223,219,150,138,32,195,161,65,239,190,241,51,14,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
