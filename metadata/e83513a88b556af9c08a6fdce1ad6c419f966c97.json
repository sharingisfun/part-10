With this approach in mind and with the intention to exemplify robust control applications, this book includes selected chapters that describe models of H-infinity loop, robust stability and uncertainty, among others. Each robust control method and model discussed in this book is illustrated by a relevant example that serves as an overview of the theoretical and practical method in robust control","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83513a88b556af9c08a6fdce1ad6c419f966c97","amp;dn":"Robust+Control+Theoretical+Models+and+Case+Studies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83513a88b556af9c08a6fdce1ad6c419f966c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,53,19,168,139,85,106,249,192,138,111,220,225,173,108,65,159,150,108,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
