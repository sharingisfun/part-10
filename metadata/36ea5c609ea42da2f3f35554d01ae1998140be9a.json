At McGraw-Hill, we have spent thousands of hours with you and your students, working to understand the key needs and concerns you face in Human Development courses. The most common topics raised include managing the vast amount of content inherent to a Lifespan course and ensuring the dependability of the assigned materialÃ¢â‚¬â€is it current and accurate? The result of this research is John SantrockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Life-Span Development.\n\nLife-Span Development ensures students complete and understand the assigned material in a number of ways: SantrockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hallmark Learning Goals pedagogy provides a comprehensive roadmap to the text material, clearly pointing out the core concepts fundamental to studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ learning and performance. Our adaptive study tool, LearnSmart, increases studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ efficiency in studying by identifying what they know, and more importantly what they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know, providing immediate remediation for the areas in which they are struggling. At the same time, instructors have access to powerful, visual reports allowing them to quickly see where studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ strengths and weaknesses lie. Connect Lifespan takes your instruction and your studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ learning experience to the next level without requiring hours of setup and personalized instruction by you.\n\nThe 14th edition continues with the connections theme to help students better understand the concepts among the different aspects of life-span development. This recurring theme of connectionsÃ¢â‚¬â€Developmental Connections, Topical Connections, Connecting Development to Life, Connecting with Careers, and Connections through ResearchÃ¢â‚¬â€ties together concepts from across chapters to reinforce the learning process and connects the material to studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ everyday lives and future aspirations.
