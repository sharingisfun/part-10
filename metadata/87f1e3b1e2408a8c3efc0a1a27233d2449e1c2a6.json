Instead, it was lovingly scanned from the original book, OCR'ed, proofread, spellchecked, formatted and PDF'ed by me, which took a couple of weeks.\n\n- Kurt Vonnegut died in 2007, so this isn't denying him any royalties. Wouldn't post it if it was.\n\n- There's only a PDF as I find it a pain to convert to other formats... sorry. Feel free of course!\n\n- Please seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others. My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.\nIf everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f1e3b1e2408a8c3efc0a1a27233d2449e1c2a6","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vonnegut%2C+Jr.+-+Welcome+to+the+Monkey+House+%281968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f1e3b1e2408a8c3efc0a1a27233d2449e1c2a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,241,227,177,226,64,138,140,62,252,10,26,39,35,61,36,73,225,194,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
