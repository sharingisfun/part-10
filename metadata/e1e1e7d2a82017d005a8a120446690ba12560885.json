Nevertheless, this collection does a fine job of representing Isaacs move from roots-inspired singer, to lover's rock crooner, and on to dancehall master, while covering all points in between. Isaacs's lovely voice can be both laid-back and passionate, and his delivery is always marked by an assuredness and grace that shines through no matter what stage in his career (he recorded steadily from the 1970s through the 2000s). His early hits like &quot;My Number One&quot; were recorded with some of Jamaica's most famous producers, including Lee Perry and Niney Holness. Isaacs's later recordings, including dancehall classics like &quot;Rough Neck,&quot; might not appeal to fans of his early work, but they demonstrate the singer's incredible range, and round out this excellent career overview. Includes liner notes by David Katz. All tracks have been digitally remastered. Compilation producer: Dana G. Smart.
