Only, Elle doesn't remember any of this. Elle, in a spirit form detached from her comatose body, must not only unravel the mystery of her attacker's identity and motive but her entire life as well. Who can she trust, in both this word and in the gap she exists in that lies between life and death? Filled with twists and turns, Elle's life isn't the only one turned upside down by the attack on her life. Deceit, secrets, and hidden agendas are everywhere in a story where everyone is a suspect, and no one is innocent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9deede57931eaaf1b736b996aeced2da88ec61a9","amp;dn":"Mind+the+Gap+Vol.+1+%282012%29+%28Digital+TPB%29+%28Fawkes-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9deede57931eaaf1b736b996aeced2da88ec61a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,238,222,87,147,30,170,241,183,54,185,150,174,206,210,218,136,236,97,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
