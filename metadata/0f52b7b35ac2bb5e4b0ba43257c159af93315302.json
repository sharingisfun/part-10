The eponymous 1967 album has been influential in jazz and pop music.\n \nAn impressive late 60s Brazilian jazz album, featuring early work by percussionist Airto Moreira(Miles Davis, Weather Report), multi-instrumental madman, Hermeto Pascoal(Miles Davis), and songwriter Geraldo Vandre, along with guitarists Theo De Barros and Heraldo Do Monte.\n\nComing from the northeastern part of Brasil, all of these men were intimately familiar with baiÃƒÂ£o music, the danceable rhythmic style comprised of a syncopated 2/4 time signature that could be played on the double-skinned zabumba drum and harmonic and melodic structures written around a Lydian flat seventh scale, it is derived from the tuning of the pÃƒÂ­fano flute, which has a raised fourth and flattened seventh. The chord structure is based on a dominant seventh.\n\nThis meld of styles, traditional Brazilian music and bebop jazz, and the deep interest in subtle yet innovative rhythmic interplay, counterpoint, and taut song structures are to this day quite revolutionary.\n\n \nTracklist:\n1. O Ovo \n2. Gica Mal com Deus \n3. Canto Geral \n4. AlgodÃƒÂ£o \n5. Canta Maria \n6. SÃƒÂ­ntese \n7. Misturada \n8.
