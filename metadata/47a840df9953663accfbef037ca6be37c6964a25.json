But it doesn't take long to\nfigure out what's going on, especially after the first person Ryouta meets tries to\nkill him. Someone is attempting to recreate the ultra-violent Btoom! game in real life,\nand the island has been filled with an army of other unwilling players, each armed with\none of the multiple variants of explosive weapons called BIM. Fortunately, Ryouta's an ace Btoom!\nplayer, but this insane version of the game has no reset switch or second lives, and there's only\none way off the island: kill seven other people before they can kill you! Can Ryouta repurpose his\ngame based skills fast enough to survive?\n\n\n\nVIDEO\nVideo Source: BD-J\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\nVideo FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\nCodec: FLAC 24bit\nTrack 1: English: Stereo\nTrack 2: Japanese: Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES\nTrack 1: English Signs/Songs\nTrack 2: English Subtitles\n\nEXTRAS\nBakusatsu Digest 1 &amp; 2\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a840df9953663accfbef037ca6be37c6964a25","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+BTOOOM%21+1-12+Complete+%28Dual+Audio%29+%5BBDRip-1080p-8bit-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a840df9953663accfbef037ca6be37c6964a25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,168,64,223,153,83,102,58,204,251,239,3,124,166,190,55,198,150,74,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
