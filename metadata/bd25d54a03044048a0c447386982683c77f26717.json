The new wave of DJs &amp; producers that have risen up to form a closely-knit EDM community in the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Unlike tranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first wave, do not expect one specific sound from LeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut album. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PicturesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ demonstrates, to the greatest possible degree a broad swathe of EDM textures that pushes the pigeonhole term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to the point of combustion.\n\nLeon was born in 1980 in the deliberately vague (but not The Hague!) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsome where in the middle of HollandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. From birth he was pre-installed with a love of moody music. After releasing his tracks and providing remixes for many big labels over the years he felt that 2008 was the right moment to launch his first artist album.\n\nAs a veritable production house, Leon has worked at the rate of (close to) one track or remix a month for the last 2 years. Disc 1 sees Leon flying production-solo and includes his latest biggest slammers like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ocean Drive BoulevardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. On Disc 2 meanwhile he is joined by compatriots from across the lowlands for an avalanche of collaborations. Leon has teamed up with some of his best friends &amp; colleagues including rising stars &amp; noted new-guard luminaries Galen Behr, Sied van Riel, Daniel Wanrooy, Joop, Cliff Coenraad &amp; Thomas Hagenbeek, Freek Geuze (Global Illumination) and Jonas Steur.\n\nThe first single to be taken from the album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I Finally FoundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will be released on the 8th of September 2008 on 2Play Recordings. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PicturesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will be released on the 29th of September 2008, while the 26th will see the album lift-off at a massive launch party at Club Poema, in Utrecht with a line up including: Fine Taste, Joop, Sied van Riel, Orjan Nilsen &amp; Leon Bolier\n\nCD1\n\n    Huachinango\n    Offshore\n    Darling Harbour\n    Dnipro\n    I Finally Found (ft.
