Barnum \nProductions 1980 Broadway\n1981 West End \n\nBarnum is a musical with a book by Mark Bramble, lyrics by Michael Stewart, and music by Cy Coleman. It is based on the life of showman P. T. Barnum, covering the period from 1835 through 1880 in America and major cities of the world where Barnum took his performing companies. The production combines elements of traditional musical theater with the spectacle of the circus. The characters include jugglers, trapeze artists and clowns, as well as such real-life personalities as Jenny Lind, General Tom Thumb, and Susan B. Anthony.\n\nAs he presents his circus acts around the world, Barnum resists joining with James Anthony Bailey. Finally, after his beloved wife Charity dies, he relents and joins with Bailey and they form the famous circus Barnum and Bailey.\n\nProductions\nBarnum opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre on April 30, 1980 and closed on May 16, 1982, after 854 performances and 26 previews. Directed and choreographed by Joe Layton, it starred Jim Dale as P.T. Barnum, Glenn Close (Charity Barnum), Marianne Tatum (Jenny Lind), Terri White (Joice Heth), and Terrence Mann (Chester Lyman).\n\nThe West End production opened on June 11, 1981 at the London Palladium, where it ran for 655 performances. Michael Crawford and Deborah Grant headed the cast. This production was recorded for television and broadcast by the BBC in 1986. It is now available on Region-free DVD.\n\n\nSong list\nAct I \n&quot;Overture Chase&quot; \n&quot;There Is a Sucker Born Ev&amp;#039;ry Minute&quot;--Phineas Taylor Barnum \n&quot;Humble Beginnings Chase&quot; \n&quot;Thank God I&amp;#039;m Old&quot;--Joice Heth and Tambourine Players \n&quot;The Colors of My Life Part I&quot;--Phineas Taylor Barnum and Chairy Barnum \n&quot;The Colors of My Life Part II&quot; \n&quot;One Brick at a Time&quot;--Chairy Barnum, Phineas Taylor Barnum and Bricklayers \n&quot;Museum Song&quot;--Phineas Taylor Barnum \n&quot;Female of the Species Chase&quot; \n&quot;I Like Your Style&quot;--Phineas Taylor Barnum and Chairy Barnum \n&quot;Bigger Isn&amp;#039;t Better&quot;--Tom Thumb \n&quot;Love Makes Such Fools of Us All&quot;--Jenny Lind \n&quot;Midway Chase&quot; \n&quot;Out There&quot;--Phineas Taylor Barnum \nAct II \n&quot;Come Follow the Band&quot;--Potomac Marching Band and Washingtonians \n&quot;Black and White&quot;--Chairy Barnum, Choir, Blues Singer, Phineas Taylor Barnum and Citizens of Bridgeprot \n&quot;The Colors of My Life (Reprise)&quot;--Phineas Taylor Barnum and Chairy Barnum \n&quot;The Prince of Humbug&quot;--Phineas Taylor Barnum \n&quot;Join the Circus&quot;--James A.
