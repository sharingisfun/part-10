Deadlier than the club, more ubiquitous than the sword, the knife is the universal edged weapon of all humankind. As our society has grown more advanced, and more reliant on technology, there has been an increased interest in the weapons of the past.\n\nHank Reinhardt was a widely known authority on medieval arms and armor and a long-time columnist for Blade magazine. Unlike many experts, Reinhardt insisted on actually making and testing the weapons he wrote about, and through his various activities was instrumental in increasing the popularity of arms and armor in mainstream America.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hank-Reinhardts-Book-Knives-Illustrated/dp/1451637551&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hank-Reinhardts-Book-Knives-Illustrated/dp/1451637551&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ed23eaa096fd2a60e9d71788392c9a9d771451f","amp;dn":"Hank+Reinhardt%27s+Book+of+Knives%3A+A+Practical+and+Illustrated+Gui","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ed23eaa096fd2a60e9d71788392c9a9d771451f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,210,62,170,9,111,210,166,14,157,113,120,131,146,201,169,215,113,69,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
