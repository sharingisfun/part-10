It's not 100% perfect, but the convenience of reading the entire series on a kindle is worth it.\n\nPeople often talk about the kindle's potential as a comic-book reader, with color often mentioned as a drawback. TWD's in glorious black-and-white, and looks great on my device.\n\nThese aren't my scans, kudos to the original scanners - their details remain in the files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc70cde7ba785962aad8e92a80b2e127455dc4ba","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+01-90+for+Kindle+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc70cde7ba785962aad8e92a80b2e127455dc4ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,112,205,231,186,120,89,98,170,216,233,42,128,178,225,39,69,93,196,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
