Edith Wharton\n\nThe Antidote: Happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking is an exploration of a radically new path to happiness.\n\nIn an approach that turns decades of self-help advice on its head, Oliver Burkeman explains why positive thinking serves only to make us more miserable, and why 'getting motivated' can exacerbate procrastination.\n\nComparing the personal philosophies of dozens of 'happy' peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€among them philosophers and experimental psychologists, Buddhists and terrorism experts, New Age dreamers and hard-headed business consultantsÃ¢â‚¬â€Burkeman uncovers some common ground. They all believe that there is an alternative 'negative path' to happiness and success that involves coming face-to-face with, even embracing, precisely the things we spend our lives trying to avoid.\n\nBurkeman concedes that in our personal lives and the world at large, it's our constant efforts to eliminate the negativeÃ¢â‚¬â€uncertainty, unhappiness, failureÃ¢â‚¬â€that cause us to feel so anxious, insecure and unhappy.\n\nHilarious and compulsively readable, The Antidote will have you on the road to happiness in no time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb9f7620090c4d02e4f3dced14475bfaa985fb6","amp;dn":"Antidote%3A+Happiness+for+People+Who+Can%27t+Stand+Positive+Thinking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb9f7620090c4d02e4f3dced14475bfaa985fb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,185,247,98,0,144,196,208,46,79,61,206,209,68,117,191,170,152,95,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
