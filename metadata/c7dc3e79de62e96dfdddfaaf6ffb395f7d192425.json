Based on a Walter Alexander bus body, the Nodding Donkey was introduced to the rail network in the mid-1980s and is well known for its unsophisticated bouncy ride and meagre seating, faithfully recreated in this model. Also included is a Quick Drive compatible High Speed Train (HST) in First Great Western livery.\n\n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nPlease use the email address or the facebook fanpage for requests, questions and also if you want to share an addon with the community which we will post on your behalf.\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please read the Readme.pdf.\n\n\n\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7dc3e79de62e96dfdddfaaf6ffb395f7d192425","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+The+Riviera+Line%3A+Exeter-Paignton+Route","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7dc3e79de62e96dfdddfaaf6ffb395f7d192425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,220,62,121,222,98,233,109,253,221,250,175,111,251,57,95,125,25,36,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
