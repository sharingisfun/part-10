What accounts for the increasing prevalence of violence and anxiety in our world? In this new edition of his controversial 1969 bestseller, The Human Zoo, renowned zoologist Desmond Morris argues that many of the social instabilities we face are largely a product of the artificial, impersonal confines of our urban surroundings. Indeed, our behavior often startlingly resembles that of captive animals, and our developed and urbane environment seems not so much a concrete jungle as it does a human zoo. Animals do not normally exhibit stress, random violence, and erratic behavior until they are confined. Similarly, the human propensity toward antisocial and sociopathic behavior is intensified in today's cities. Morris argues that we are biologically still tribal and ill-equipped to thrive in the impersonal urban sprawl. As important and meaningful today as it was a quarter-century ago, The Human Zoo sounds an urgent warning and provides startling insight into our increasingly complex lives.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n&quot;AmbitiousÃ¢â‚¬Â¦compellingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦concerned with the tension between our biology and our cultureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦in power, sex, status, and war games.&quot; - The New York Times\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Author\n&quot;There is really no need to escape [our cities]Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. But there is a need to transform the urban environment into something more appropriate for its long-suffering inhabitants.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Desmond Morris, from his new Preface\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nDesmond Morris is the author of more than thirty books, including The Naked Ape, Intimate Behavior, and Human Animal.
