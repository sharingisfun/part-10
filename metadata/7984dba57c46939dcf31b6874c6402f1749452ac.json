Macomber (Wiley, 1998).pdf\r\n\r\nClear, accessible coverage of modern NMR spectroscopy-for students and professionals in many fields of science\r\n\r\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has made quantum leaps in the last decade, becoming a staple tool in such divergent fields as chemistry, physics, materials science, biology, and medicine. That is why it is essential that scientists working in these areas be fully conversant with current NMR theory and practice.\r\n\r\nThis down-to-basics text offers a comprehensive, up-to-date treatment of the fundamentals of NMR spectroscopy. Using a straightforward approach that develops all concepts from a rudimentary level without using heavy mathematics, it gives readers the knowledge they need to solve any molecular structure problem from a complete set of NMR data. Topics are illustrated throughout with hundreds of figures and actual spectra. Chapter-end summaries and review problems with answers are included to help reinforce and test understanding of key material.\r\n\r\nFrom NMR studies of biologically important molecules to magnetic resonance imaging, this book serves as an excellent all-around primer on NMR spectroscopic analysis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7984dba57c46939dcf31b6874c6402f1749452ac","amp;dn":"A+Complete+Introduction+to+Modern+NMR+Spectrocopy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7984dba57c46939dcf31b6874c6402f1749452ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,132,219,165,124,70,147,157,207,49,182,135,76,100,2,241,116,148,82,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
