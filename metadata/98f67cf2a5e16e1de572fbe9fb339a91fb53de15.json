Today it's &quot;Artist's Choice - The Eddie Harris Anthology&quot; in .flac, cover and booklet scans are included.\nMy mother always uses to listen to this when she's preparing those delicious tortillas with those mexican mushrooms that make your head soo funny......so biggie up and respect to my mother, those mexican mushrooms and the almighty Jah for having created them and that Eddie Harris guy...\n\nAnd here is some REAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nThis is the one and only way how to prepare the real Marianito preparao as it has to be on sunday morning after church:\nGive about five or six ice cubes into a jar\nnow a litlle hint of Angostura over the ice (0,5 cl)\nadd some fine quality gin and Red CuraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ao (1cl of each)\nnow add Martini Rosso (10cl)\nstir it , NEVER AND IN NO WAY THINK ABOUT SHAKING HIM !!!!!!\npour it with filtering the ice into two cocktailglasses\nadd a piece of orange skin lightly pressed over each of the Marianitos preparaos.\nEnjoy with some Olives or caracoliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±os. And thank the lord that you are so lucky to live in Bilbao, the center of the universe where they make the best of them. AMEN\n\n\nPlease don't be upsetted if the download may take a while: I can only upload with a speed of about 200 KBit/s. Blame Euskaltel and or the basque and especially the spanish government for it !!!!!\n\nHave also a look on other torrents I've posted and feel free to place a comment or a feedback. I would be very glad about. Eskerrik asko !
