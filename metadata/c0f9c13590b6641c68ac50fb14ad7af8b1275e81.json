On initial glance the three might not seem reconcilable, but, in essence a few chords do relate them. Machismo and masculinity, for instance, can be found in all the three, as do growing nihilism and cynicism, trenchant socio-political contextualization (intended or otherwise) and how it shapes its protagonists and antagonists, the concepts of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlone wolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and underhanded heroism, and so forth. Consequently, it deserves attention when a filmmaker manages to reconcile the three without any palpable display of forcefulness or discomfort. What might surprise one, though, is that AndrÃƒÂ© De Toth, despite not being someone who comes to mind immediately when one thinks of all the famous and/or iconic American filmmakers, managed to achieve that so seamlessly and memorably.\n\nDay of the Outlaw, De TothÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s astounding last Western, was one of the finest fusions of the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s setting and themes with noirish sensibilities and tone, and gangster elements Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most notably the invariable comeuppance, that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen. On one hand it placed a lone wolf at odds with the changing times and evolving civilization around him, while on the other it showed how fragile any society, at the end of the day, essentially is at the face of primal forces. It also made terrific use of harsh Wyoming winter to complement its relentlessly bleak tone and ambivalent characters.\n\nTo cut a long story short, De Toth carved a masterpiece here that, from what I reckon, never received the kind of standing ovation that it deserved. The likes of Crime Wave and Pitfall were good, but nowhere as good. What was perhaps tellingly poignant, he managed to direct just another movie in his life, that too nearly a decade later.\n\nArguably Andre de Toth's greatest film, this 1959 western combines a hostage situation with a bleak, snowbound terrain to produce a gripping vision of hopeless entrapment. Robert Ryan stars as a rancher who's about to start a gunfight over land when a motley gang of outlaws led by Burl Ives ride in and take over the town. Because it's at the end of the trail, the outlaws become &quot;prisoners of a white silence,&quot; in de Toth's words: isolated, surrounded by snow, they're about to run wild with the townswomen when Ryan leads them on a false escape route through the mountains. Their final ride is one of the most despairing visions in all cinema: the turning course followed by the men seems to twist back on itself, and the stark black-and-white background of rock and snow forms a closed, lifeless world excluding all human warmth.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 942mb\nDuration.... 01:32:11\nCodec.......
