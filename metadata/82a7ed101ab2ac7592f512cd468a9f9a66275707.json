He is best known as the lead singer of The Verve, an English rock band that he helped form in 1989. After that band&amp;#039;s demise in 1999, Ashcroft embarked on a successful solo career. He grew up in the town of Skelmersdale, Lancashire.\n\nAshcroft&amp;#039;s father died when Richard was 11. Ashcroft soon fell under the influence of his stepfather, who belonged to the ancient secular order of the Rosicrucians.\n\nHe is good friends with Oasis&amp;#039; Noel Gallagher and Coldplay&amp;#039;s Chris Martin (whom Ashcroft once thanked for &quot;letting me be myself again&quot;), and occasionally plays as support at Oasis and Coldplay concerts, including the European and second UK legs of Coldplay&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Twisted Logic Tour&amp;#039;. He recently described himself as &quot;the best support act you&amp;#039;ll ever see.&quot; The Oasis track &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; is dedicated to him, and it is believed that Ashcroft dedicated The Verve&amp;#039;s 1995 song &quot;Northern Soul&quot; to Noel Gallagher. Martin introduced him as &quot;the best singer in the world&quot; when he performed &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; (which Martin called &quot;probably the best song ever written&quot;) with Coldplay at the London Live 8 concert in 2005. On his second album, Human Conditions, Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson performs on the song &quot;Nature is the Law&quot;. Ashcroft is married to Kate Radley, the former keyboard player for British shoegaze band Spiritualized. Together, they have two sons: Sonny, born in 2000, and Cassius, born in 2004.\n\nAshcroft&amp;#039;s third solo album, Keys to the World, was recorded with the co-operation of the London Metropolitan Orchestra, and released on January 23, 2006, by Parlophone. The first single from the album, &quot;Break the Night with Colour&quot;, was released on January 9, 2006, and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 3. Around the time of the album&amp;#039;s release, Ashcroft announced his largest UK tour for years for May 2006, culminating in three nights at London&amp;#039;s Brixton Academy. He opened for the second half of Coldplay&amp;#039;s tour, starting March 14, 2006, in Ottawa. The second single released from Keys To The World was &quot;Music Is Power&quot;, which charted at number 20. The next single, &quot;Words Just Get in the Way&quot;, charted even lower, barely making it into the Top 40 at the number 40 position after receiving barely any promotion or airplay.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.richardashcroft.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.richardashcroft.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a7ed101ab2ac7592f512cd468a9f9a66275707","amp;dn":"Richard+Ashcroft+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a7ed101ab2ac7592f512cd468a9f9a66275707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,167,237,16,26,178,172,117,146,245,18,205,70,138,159,154,102,39,87,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
