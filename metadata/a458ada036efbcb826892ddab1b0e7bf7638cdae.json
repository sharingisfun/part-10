Aging writer and philosopher, ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©non Ligre, comes to Bruges using a false name and papers to serve as a physician to the poor, establishing a clinic and steam bath. His methods and opinions are outside the mainstream, but he has the protection and friendship of the local Prior. ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©non, an aristocrat with a degree in canon law, lives humbly. He learns of bacchanals under Masonic signs involving monks and women, and he warns those involved. The Prior is dying, and he urges ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©non to flee to England. ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©non burns his writing. Will he leave or will he face ecclesiastical accusers and, perhaps, the stake?

They seem to drift by in a sort of glacial calm, although the subject matter is often very interesting. Rendez-vous ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Bray was the first film of his I saw, and it repaid watching even if the emotional temperature was rather low. L'Oeuvre au noir is taken from a Marguerite Yourcenar novel, and shows the austerity she was famous for. At times it feels rather like walking barefoot over a marble floor.\n\nGian-Maria VolontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s voice had to be dubbed for the film [probably why the Italian audio track is better synchronized], but his face is expressive. We can follow his efforts to bring modern medical and scientific practices to Flanders in defiance of the Inquisition. Sami Frey as his cousin the prior is sympathetic. \n\nFile type: KLCP, Matroska\nFile size: 1,146,227 Kb\n\nFrame size: 592x320\nVideo compression: h264 (MPEG4)\nFrame rate: 25.000\nDuration: 01:44:43\n\nAudio format: liba52 (Dolby ac3 2.0)\nAudio frequency: 48.000\nAudio stream count: 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a458ada036efbcb826892ddab1b0e7bf7638cdae","amp;dn":"L%5C%27oeuvre.au.Noir.1988.Andr%C3%83%C2%A9.Delvaux.DVDRip.XviD.MKO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a458ada036efbcb826892ddab1b0e7bf7638cdae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,88,173,160,54,239,188,184,38,137,45,218,177,176,231,191,118,56,205,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
