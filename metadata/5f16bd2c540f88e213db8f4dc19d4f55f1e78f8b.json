Below is a press release from Brianmay.com.\n\nThe BBC has just confirmed that the Queen Hammersmith concert/documentary will definitely be broadcast on British television on BBC 2, Friday 27 November at 11.35pm.\n\nDon't miss this rare treat!!\n\nQueen: The Legendary 1975 Concert\nFriday 27 November\n11:35pm - 12:25am\nBBC2\nVIDEO Plus+: 805114\nSubtitled, Widescreen\n\nThe Legendary Queen Christmas show at the Hammersmith Odeon from December 24th 1975 is to be broadcast on BBC2 on Friday Nov 27th at 11.35pm.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1975, Queen crowned a glorious year with a special concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon. The final night of their triumphant UK tour, the show was simulcast live on BBC TwoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Old Grey Whistle Test and BBC Radio One. It has become a legendary event in Queen's history, featuring stunning renditions of early hits Killer Queen, Keep Yourself Alive, Liar and Now I'm Here alongside Brian May's epic guitar showcase Brighton Rock, a rip-roaring version of the then new Bohemian Rhapsody and the crowd-pleasing Rock 'n' Roll Medley.\n\nFreddie, Brian, Roger and John set the place alight in their incredible stage outfits and long hair. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt's been really like a party here tonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Brian.\n\nIncidentally, Brian and FreddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parents met for the first time at this show. They had lived a couple of streets away from one another for over a decade, yet somehow had never actually encountered one another!\n\nThe fruit of more than four years detective work to find missing video footage and even the original multi-track audio tapes which were thought to have been wiped, this new 50 minute version of the show features a fantastic new sound mix produced by Queen engineers Justin Shirley-Smith, Kris Fredriksson, and Joshua J Macrae.\n\nThis Legendary show, widely regarded by fans as one of QueenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest, is finally coming to our screens.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just such an extraordinary performance!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Charlie Stayt, BBC TV Breakfast\n\n---\n\nThe set list that night was as follows (not all songs may be included in the broadcast):\n\nNow IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Here / Ogre Battle / White Queen / Medley: Bohemian Rhapsody; Killer Queen; The March Of The Black Queen; Bohemian Rhapsody (Reprise); Bring Back That Leroy Brown / Brighton Rock / Guitar Solo / Son And Daughter (Reprise) / Keep Yourself Alive / Liar / In The Lap Of The Gods (Revisited) / Encore Medley: Big Spender; Jailhouse Rock; Stupid Cupid; Be Bop A Lula; Shake Rattle And Roll; Jailhouse Rock (Reprise) / Second Encore: Seven Seas Of Rhye / See What A Fool IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Been / God Save The Queen\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â© brianmay.com\n\nNOT MY RIP - According to the original poster, this was capped from BBC2 direct to a DVD-Recorder.
