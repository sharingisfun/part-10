It was released on the\nsame day that Led Zeppelin's entire catalog became available in digital stores,\nincluding the iTunes Store.The cover was created by artist Shepard Fairey.\n\nThe songs included were chosen by the surviving members of Led Zeppelin,\nRobert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, and represent all eight of the\nband's studio albums. In addition to a two-disc set, the album is also available in\nboth &quot;deluxe&quot; and &quot;collector's&quot; editions with a DVD featuring varied live content\nfrom the previously released Led Zeppelin DVD. A 4-LP vinyl package was also\nreleased on 26 August 2008.\n\nOn 8 November 2007, a temporary XM radio station, XM LED was made in order to\nsupport the album. It was scheduled only to last six months, and ceased its\noperations on 5 May 2008. The channel was actually dropped from the XM lineup\non 7 March 2008.
