Justin Fox's The Myth of the Rational Market explains where that idea came from, and where it went wrong. \n \n \n \n \nAs much an intellectual whodunit as a cultural history of the perils and possibilities of risk, it also brings to life the people and ideas that forged modern finance and investingÃ¢â‚¬â€from the formative days of Wall Street through the Great Depression and into the financial calamities of today. It's a tale featuring professors who made and lost fortunes, battled fiercely over ideas, beat the house at blackjack, wrote bestselling books, and played major roles on the world stage. It's also a story of free-market capitalism's war with itself.\n \n \n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ebd0e3adfb0a1262b6ad98075ac44b5b65a2f7c","amp;dn":"The+Myth+of+the+Rational+Market+-+A+History+of+Risk%2C+Reward%2C+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ebd0e3adfb0a1262b6ad98075ac44b5b65a2f7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,189,14,58,223,176,161,38,43,106,217,128,117,172,68,181,182,90,47,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
