It clarifies a vital topic for students of biomechanics who work in a variety of fields, including biological sciences, exercise and sports science, health sciences, ergonomics and human factors, and engineering and applied science. Following the path of a traditional introductory course, Biomechanics for Dummies covers the terminology and fundamentals of biomechanics, bone, joint, and muscle composition and function, motion analysis and control, kinematics and kinetics, fluid mechanics, stress and strain, applications of biomechanics, and black and white medical illustrations.\n*\tOffers insights and expertise in biomechanics to provide an easy-to-follow, jargon-free guide to the subject\n*\tProvides students who major in kinesiology, neuroscience, biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physical education, nutritional science, and many other subjects with a basic knowledge of biomechanics\nStudents and self-motivated learners interested in biological, applied, exercise, sports, and health sciences should not be without this accessible guide to the fundamentals.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mDS30sg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mDS30sg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0dd01cc0b40acb1310c63927e3c0b458dc09d6","amp;dn":"Biomechanics+For+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0dd01cc0b40acb1310c63927e3c0b458dc09d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,13,208,28,192,180,10,203,19,16,198,57,39,227,192,180,88,220,9,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
