It was directed by Ishiro- Honda, written by \nTakeshi Kimura based on the story &quot;The Voice in the \nNight&quot; by William Hope Hodgson (an adaptation credit \nis given to Masami Fukushima and Shinichi Hoshi, but \nKimura threw out most of their contributions), and \nhad special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya.\n\n---------------- TRAILER -----------------\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe movie has developed something of a cult audience \nover the years; partly due to its bleakness and unusual \nthemes, particularly when compared to other Japanese \nfilms of the same period.\n\nThe film was never released in mainstream American \ntheaters, but probably did have limited exhibition in \nJapanese-American communities on the West Coast in its \noriginal language. When it was released by American \nInternational Pictures in 1965, it was directly \nsyndicated on 16mm color film to television as a TV-movie \nbearing the title Attack of the Mushroom People (the title \nis, in fact, placed directly over the original title \npainted on stone, part of which is cropped out of the \nimage). With the advent of home video, used TV prints of \nthis dubbed version found their way to well-established \npublic domain dealers such as Something Weird Video, making \nit available for home viewing in Beta or VHS formats. It was \nat this time that it began developing its cult following and \nits reputation as an unusually disturbing film.\n\n(Filming locations were Hachijo-jima and O-shima,Japan.)\n\n--------------- SCREENSHOTS ---------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37531.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37531.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37532.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37532.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37533.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37533.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37534.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37534.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37535.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37535.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37536.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37536.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------------------------\n\n   General\n   \n      Matango.1963.(DD5.1).DivX-NvadR.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.34 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 29mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 148 Kbps\n      Writing library : VirtualDub-MPEG2 build 24586/release\n      \n   Video \n   \n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 1 691 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.330\n      Stream size : 1.06 GiB (79%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.4\n      \n   Audio\n   \n      Audio Language : English\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 287 MiB (21%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 512 ms\n      \n    Source  - Tokyo Shock\n      \n      Region One DVD9 (NTSC) 720 x 480 29.970 fps 2.35:1 \n      Color AC3 Digital Dolby 6CH Stereo 448 Kb/s 48.0 KHz\n      \n\n    Encoders Note:\n     \n      There are a number of torrents floating around\n      of this film, yet the best one has 5.1 but it is\n      encoded in Italian, so now English speaking viewers\n      can now enjoy this classic in Digital Dolby\n      surround sound.
