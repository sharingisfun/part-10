He examines its &quot;first principles&quot; and identifies its genres and basic elements; his analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion. &quot;Although Aristotle's Poetics is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition,&quot; Marvin Carlson explains, &quot;almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c958a5b80181bf35306c0d356ec20e104d942ad","amp;dn":"Poetics+-+Aristole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c958a5b80181bf35306c0d356ec20e104d942ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,149,138,91,128,24,27,243,83,6,192,211,86,236,32,225,4,217,66,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
