Founded in 1988 by Alex Paterson and KLF member Jimmy Cauty, The Orb began as ambient and dub DJs in London. Its early performances were inspired by ambient and electronic artists of the 1970s and 1980s, most notably Brian Eno and Kraftwerk. Because of its trippy sound, the Orb developed a cult following among clubbers &quot;coming down&quot; from drug-induced highs.[1] The Orb has maintained its drug-related and science fiction themes despite personnel changes including the departure of Cauty and other Orb members Kris Weston, Andy Falconer, Simon Phillips, and Andy Hughes. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with the Swiss-German producer Thomas Fehlmann and, later, with Killing Joke's Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover and Tim Bran of Dreadzone.[2]\n\nAlex Paterson prides the Orb on manipulating obscure samples beyond recognition on its albums and during its concerts; his unauthorised use of other artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones[3] and Steve Reich. During its live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained its colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intensive performances prompted critics to compare the group to Pink Floyd.[4]\n\nThe Orb's critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom peaked in the early 1990s with the albums The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld and U.F.Orb, the latter of which reached #1 on the British album charts in 1992. This success led to its infamous appearance on Top of the Pops, where the group showcased its quirky style by playing chess (an interest of Paterson's since his early youth) while the group's single &quot;Blue Room&quot; ran in the background. The Orb's mid-1990s albums were met with mixed reactions from British critics; however, its work received praise from American publications such as Rolling Stone. The group experimented with vocalists on its next two albums, which critics generally described as bland and uninspired. The Orb then shifted gears to a minimal techno style spearheaded by member Thomas Fehlmann, releasing its new material on the record label Kompakt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld 1991\n\n\nThe Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld is the seminal 1991 ambient house-concept debut album by the electronic music collective The Orb. The album's framework is of a two-hour psychedelic trip through music genres and studio electronics, produced to &quot;push the threshold&quot; of live stage performance. The double album is a continuous progressive composition consisting of several tracks advancing the journey concept and composed of vocal samples and sound effects interspersed with original music.There are three versions, a 109:41 minute UK release, a 70:41 minute U.S. release and a 182:05 minute UK Deluxe Edition reissue that was released in mid 2006.\n\n\nThe Orb have always primarily been composed of one individual, Alex Paterson, along with numerous and varied individuals assisting throughout the group's recording career.[1] Paterson's late 80's and early 90's chillout dj sets in Paul Oakenfold's &quot;Land of Oz&quot; night in the club Heaven are thought of by those involved as legendary.[2] and included collaborations with another ambient house pioneer Jimmy Cauty. Paterson said of these events:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\t&quot;We'd build melodies up by overdubbing and mixing multiple tracks and then take an eight track (or was it a twelve track?) into Heaven, just linking it up to three decks ([turntables]), loads of CD players, loads of cassettes... we used to keep it very, very quiet. We never used to play any drums in there. It'd be, just like, you know, BBC sound effects, really... four or five hours playing really early dub reggae... For All Mankind [a documentary of NASA's Apollo missions, with a soundtrack by Brian Eno]. We had white screens so we could put up visuals as well. We had home movies of ducks in the park. We'd go for everything. It was all layering on top of each other. &quot;[3]\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nFollowing success in the singles market (including the 1988 &quot;Tripping on Sunshine&quot;, 1989 &quot;Kiss EP&quot; and 1989 &quot;Huge, evergrowing brain that rules from the center of the Universe&quot;),[4] Paterson and Cauty started work on their first album.[5] Cauty left in 1990 to pursue another band, The KLF, with Bill Drummond,.[6] Paterson moved on to his next collaboration &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; in Autumn 1990 with Killing Joke's Youth. The track was recorded by an 18 year old studio Engineer and future Orb collaborator Kris &quot;Thrash&quot; Weston.\n\nIn April 1991, the Orb released their first album The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld for an audience familiar with their groundbreaking singles and several John Peel radio sessions.[7] The album was received in the UK and Europe with critical acclaim. The album rose to position #29 in the UK Album charts. By mid-91, the Orb had signed a deal to release the album in the U.S. but were forced to edit the double-disc 109:41 minute UK release down to a one disc 70:41 minutes. The full double-disc version and cassette were later released in the U.S. by Island.\n\nThe two covers are primarily distinguished by the outing of the Floydian Battersea Power Station on the version in U.S of A. cover.
