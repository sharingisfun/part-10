Building on the Fugazi meets Motown rhythms and grooves associated\nwith the group?s debut LP (Right Now, You?re in the Best of Hands...),\nTerrorhawk contains fifteen tracks of a weathered and harrowing mixture of\npost-hardcore and rollicking rock fused tight with gut-wrenching soul,\nwhich further defines BVS as a group of individuals that is greater than\nthe sum of its parts. While the sound on the new record will be fairly\nfamiliar to BVS?s ever-increasing devoted fan base, Terrorhawk is an\namalgam of the group?s collective musical passions and obsessions--ranging\nfrom Black Sabbath to The Commodores.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270d46eeb0e30bded05d1871cfcf6511df42c7f6","amp;dn":"Bear+vs.+Shark+-+Terrorhawk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270d46eeb0e30bded05d1871cfcf6511df42c7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,13,70,238,176,227,11,222,208,93,24,113,207,207,101,17,223,66,199,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
