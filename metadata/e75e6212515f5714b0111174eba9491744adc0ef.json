It covers a variety of topics from diplomatic immunity to the UN and from recognition of government to war crimes. This new edition has been completely revised and updated by Peter Malanczuk to take account of many recent developments and includes new chapters on human rights, the environment and the economy.\n\n\nReview:\n\n'Professor Malanczuk has written a new edition of Michael Akehurst's textbook which maintains its high traditions of clarity, precision and coherence. The new edition, more widely-detailed and widely-referenced, will appeal to a wider audience than its predecessor, whilst still satisfying the needs of those seeking an accessible introduction to international law, whether lawyers or not.' - Colin Warbrick, University of Durham\n\n'Good and comprehensive reading. Covers the main areas in a contextual, auditorial way.' - Dr Bogumila Puchalska\nAbout the Author\nPeter Malanczuk is Professor at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nPaperback: 472 pages\nPublisher: Routledge; 7 edition (July 5, 1997)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 041511120X\nISBN-13: 978-0415111201\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Akehursts-Modern-Introduction-International-Law/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Akehursts-Modern-Introduction-International-Law/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTags: international, law, int. , justice, UN, UNSC, NATO, EU, ASEAN, LOS, ICC, Hague, Eu, EUHC, ECC, security studies, legal, legality, R2P, Responsibility to Protect, institution, west, western, westphalian, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75e6212515f5714b0111174eba9491744adc0ef","amp;dn":"Akehurst%27s+Modern+Introduction+to+International+Law+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75e6212515f5714b0111174eba9491744adc0ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,94,98,18,81,95,87,20,176,17,17,116,235,169,73,23,68,173,192,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
