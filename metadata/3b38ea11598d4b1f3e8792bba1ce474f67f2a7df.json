The location is San Diego, just one hour outside of the big dream we call Los Angeles. Corey (Glenn Howerton) and Katie (Tinsley Grimes) live with their Dad RT (Geoff Pierson) and Corey&amp;#039;s friend Roger (Eddie Shin). Corey is a creative soul who is trying to make it in the music world in a decade that only appreciates financial success. Although his father, RT, is a successful professional who is about to strike gold with his Gut Whacker and ride the &amp;#039;80s fitness marketing craze wave, Corey finds it difficult to get in the game. On the other hand, Corey&amp;#039;s friend Roger idolizes Ronald Reagan and listens to motivation tapes while trying to find his way into corporate America. The household is rounded out by Corey&amp;#039;s younger sister Katie, a chip off the old block whose sweetness and naivetÃƒÂ© make her the perfect go between for her father and brother. At Club Piranha, a local gathering place, Sophia (Brittany Daniel) is in control. Sophia, Corey&amp;#039;s ex, is a beautiful, &quot;grab all that I can&quot; kind of girl who doesn&amp;#039;t like to limit her choices. Sophia breaks up with Corey to explore other avenues and relationships... all types of relationships. Corey&amp;#039;s one safe haven is Permanent Record, the music store where he works for Margaret (Margaret Smith), a woman who lived through the summer of love and emerged with quite a few stories (and a rash). But things change for Corey when he&amp;#039;s forced to deal with the new girl, Tuesday (Chyler Leigh), a punk rocker who sports a mohawk and attitude to match.\nIMDB Link: http://imdb.com/title/tt0305472/\nWIKI Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_80%27s_Show\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01 - Eighties\nS1E02 - Valentine&amp;#039;s Day\nS1E03 - Tuesday Comes Over\nS1E04 - Corey&amp;#039;s Remix\nS1E05 - My Dead Friend\nS1E06 - Spring Break &amp;#039;84\nS1E07 - Katie&amp;#039;s Birthday\nS1E08 - After the Kiss\nS1E09 - Double Date\nS1E10 - Punk Club\nS1E11 - Road Trip (a.k.a.
