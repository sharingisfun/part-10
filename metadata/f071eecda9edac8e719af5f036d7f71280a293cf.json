One reviewer gave this a one star rating, calling these songs &quot;safe.&quot; This cd came out in 1990. Songs like &quot;Son of the New South,&quot; &quot;Dixie Flyer,&quot; and &quot;Put Some Drive in Your Country,&quot; were not safe at all for country radio, in fact, if anything, they were risky. The bluesy/southern rock edge found in &quot;Country Club&quot; was simply unheard of at that time. Dan Seals and Randy Travis were radio staples.\n\nWith that said, this cd sounds like the country-blues-rock lovechild of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Waylon Jennings, Charlie Daniels, and the Allman Brothers. &quot;Help me hold on&quot; and &quot;Drift off to dream,&quot; are as good as any country ballad gets. &quot;If I Were a Rich Man,&quot; is one of those country songs that just hits you in the gut. The cd ends with &quot;Dixie Flyer,&quot; which is as good musically as any jam band or bluegrass jam I've ever heard. I'd recommend this to any country music fan, and any southern rock fan as well. I can't say anything bad about this cd, as a fan of music in general and country music specifically TO me, this is as good as country music gets, and is much better than anything played on the air today. This is not just good for a country cd, this is good for music period.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTravis Tritt - Country Club\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArtist...............: Travis Tritt\nAlbum................: Country Club\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1990\n\nMP3 320cbr\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
