That's when his hand became self-aware and broke the horrific news that the world was now ruled by bears. \n\nJoin Tim as he embarks on an epic battle across time and space, unravelling the bear-ridden damage to Earth's timeline. It's a bit like Quantum Leap but with more bears and lumberjacks.\n\nFIST OF AWESOME is a heartfelt love-letter to golden classics like Double Dragon, Streets of Rage and Final Fight. Prepare yourself for the most epic time-travelling-lumberjack-em-up OF ALL TIME!\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifightbears.fistofawesome&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifightbears.fistofawesome&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7a2c4417fa98c94b3bb47250d8fd2db344971a7","amp;dn":"Fist+of+Awesome+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7a2c4417fa98c94b3bb47250d8fd2db344971a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,162,196,65,127,169,140,148,179,187,71,37,13,143,210,219,52,73,113,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
