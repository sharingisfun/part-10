The audience of 600,000 was in a fiery and frenzied mood, after turning the festival into a political arena, trampling the fences, setting fire to structures and equipment - and stoked by the most incendiary performance of Jimi Hendrix's career.\nAs Cohen followed Hendrix's set, onlookers and (fellow festival headliners) Joan Baez, Kris Kristofferson, Judy Collins and others stood sidestage in awe as the Canadian folksinger-songwriter-poet-novelist quietly tamed the crowd. Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Murray Lerner (From Mao To Mozart, Festival, Message To Love), perfectly captured Cohen's performance. Likewise, Columbia Records staff A&amp;R producer Teo Macero did a brilliant job of supervising the live audio recording.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9ce82a59c2b956fa3624ab02baf343259636f2f","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+Live+At+The+Isle+Of+Wight+1970+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9ce82a59c2b956fa3624ab02baf343259636f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,206,130,165,156,43,149,111,163,98,74,176,43,175,52,50,89,99,111,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
