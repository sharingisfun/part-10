A special edition includes a bonus DVD with 12 music videosÃ¢â‚¬â€two of which are new, &quot;The Prime Time of Your Life&quot; and &quot;Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)&quot;. To save space on the audio CD, a few of the tracks are shorter edits. The song &quot;Digital Love&quot; appears only in the digital release and Japan edition. The DVD edition was rated 15 by the BBFC, due to the content of &quot;The Prime Time of Your Life&quot; video.  \nThe name of the album comes from &quot;Musique&quot;, a song that was initially released as the B-side to &quot;Da Funk&quot;. Although it was released before Daft Punk's debut album Homework, &quot;Musique&quot; was not intended for it. Thomas Bangalter pointed out that sales of &quot;Da Funk&quot; were greater than that of the album, so the majority of listeners would have attained the song through the former. The song can also be found on the Wipeout XL video game soundtrack, which was released in 1996. A portion of &quot;Musique&quot; can be heard in the track &quot;WDPK 83.7 FM&quot; on Homework.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Musique\n[02] Da Funk\n[03] Around The World (Radio Edit)\n[04] Revolution 909\n[05] Alive\n[06] Rollin' &amp; Scratchin'\n[07] One More Time (Short Radio Edit)\n[08] Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\n[09] Something About Us\n[10] Robot Rock\n[11] Technologic (Radio Edit)\n[12] Human After All\n[13] Mothership Reconnection (Daft Punk Remix)\n[14] Chord Memory (Daft Punk Remix)\n[15] Forget About The World (DP Don't Forget The World Mix)\n\nPlay Time - 01h:15m:36s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 517mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
