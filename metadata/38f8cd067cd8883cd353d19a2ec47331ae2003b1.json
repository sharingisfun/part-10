That said, the album's most notorious cut is The Streetbeater, better known as the Sanford &amp; Son theme, a novelty for most but also one of the greasiest, grimiest instrumental fusions of jazz and funk ever laid down, while its second most noteworthy component is a drastic recasting of Summer in the City, as heard in the Pharcyde's Passin' Me By, where the frantic, bug-eyed energy of the Lovin' Spoonful original is turned into a magnetically lazy drift driven by Eddie Louis' organ, Dave Grusin's electric piano, and Valerie Simpson's voice.  (Simpson gives the song a Summertime-like treatment. ) \nBetween that, the title song (a faithfully mellow version, with Jones' limited but subdued vocal lead), a medley of Aretha Franklin's Daydreaming and Ewan MacColl's First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, and a light instrumental, roughly half the album is mood music, and it's offset with not just The Streetbeater but a large-scale take on Manteca, a spooky-then-overstuffed Superstition (where the uncredited Billy Preston, Bill Withers, and Stevie Wonder are billed as three beautiful brothers), and the Streetbeater companion Chump Change (co-written with Bill Cosby). \nEnjoy it!\n\nPersonnel:\nRay Brown\nChuck Rainey\nBob James - keyboard\nGrady Tate - drums\nDave Grusin\nCarol Kaye - bass guitar\n \nQuincy Jones - You've Got It Bad Girl Tracks:\n01  Summer In The City 4:04    \n02  Eyes Of Love 3:32    \n03  Tribute To A.
