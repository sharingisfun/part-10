J. Hollingdale's distinguished translation, together with a new historical introduction by Richard Schacht. Subtitled &quot;A Book for Free Spirits,&quot; Human, All Too Human marked for Nietzsche a new &quot;positivism&quot; and skepticism with which he challenged his previous metaphysical and psychological assumptions. Nearly all the themes of his later work are displayed here with characteristic perceptiveness and honesty--not to say suspicion and irony--in language of great brio. It remains one of the fundamental works for an understanding of his thought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043ed7fe658a857dd173f8154c0cfa5e0385263b","amp;dn":"Nietzsche+-+Human+All+Too+Human+%28CUP%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043ed7fe658a857dd173f8154c0cfa5e0385263b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,62,215,254,101,138,133,125,209,115,248,21,76,12,250,94,3,133,38,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
