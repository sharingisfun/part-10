It is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and answer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU LU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH`UN CH`IU: &quot;The King of Wu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he set forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him.&quot; As he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above- mentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c29cb9bff6ab906cd24d1b79667214a0ffe2a0","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+The+Art+of+War+by+Sun+Tzu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0c29cb9bff6ab906cd24d1b79667214a0ffe2a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,194,156,185,191,246,171,144,108,210,77,27,121,102,114,20,160,255,226,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
