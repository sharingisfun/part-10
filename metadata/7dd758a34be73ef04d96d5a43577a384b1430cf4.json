The son of a Jewish father and Mohawk mother, Jaime Robbie Robertson's first brush with live music came at the Six Nations Reservation, his mother's girlhood home; at the age of five, he also gained exposure to the country music of rural America. Not long after, he began taking guitar lessons from a cousin, and gradually began composing his first songs. As time wore on, his musical interests evolved from country to big band to rock, and he eventually dropped out of school to pursue a career as a performer. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal International\nCatalog:\t\t9837475\nIncludes:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Testimony\n02.Somewhere Down The Crazy River\n03.Sonny Got Caught In The Moonlight\n04.Sweet Fire Of Love (Feat.
