As well, this performance of Apollo (1973) is truly second to none. You will not be disappointed with either of these recordings.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86238409ebb92684582e8210c022619c2e63a6c8","amp;dn":"Stravinsky+-+The+Rite+of+Spring%2C+Apollo+-+Karajan%2C+BPO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86238409ebb92684582e8210c022619c2e63a6c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,35,132,9,235,185,38,132,88,46,130,16,192,34,97,156,46,99,166,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
