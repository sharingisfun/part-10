Or spending far too much time worrying about things you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t change? Or living for the future, not for today? Truth is, we all do ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and we all recognize that sometimes our ways of thinking just arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t productive. When it comes to our daily lives, we often laugh off habits like procrastination as being human nature and just resolve to approach things differently next time. Or, when the issues facing us are enormous or traumatic, we might recognize that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re dwelling on our problems, or otherwise spending our time on fruitless thinking, but have no idea how to get out of that miserable rut. Either way, it takes up a lot of our mental energy.\n\nBut as AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Kukla makes clear in Mental Traps, what we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t recognize ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or at least admit to ourselves! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is how thinking unproductively about even the smallest elements of everyday life can mount up and keep us from being happy, from living life to the fullest. For what appear to be minor lapses are actually ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhabitual modes of thinking that disturb our ease, waste enormous amounts of our time, and deplete our energy without accomplishing anything of value for us or anyone else.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So whether weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re dealing with how to attain our major career goals or deciding when to serve the salad course at dinnertime, the end results can be much the same: readily identifiable patterns of wasteful thinking. These, in KuklaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s view, are the mental traps.\n\nDecember 2009\nPublisher: Doubleday \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c92672db537b9c4263af5e5e59b20475d27e06a","amp;dn":"Mental+Traps%3A+The+Overthinker%5C%27s+Guide+to+a+Happier+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c92672db537b9c4263af5e5e59b20475d27e06a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,146,103,45,181,55,185,196,38,58,245,229,229,155,32,71,93,39,224,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
