Only after they successfully escape the beast's huge jaws do they all simultaneously wonder why it's hidden within the confines of the wizardry school and perhaps more intriguing still, what it could be guarding. So begins the tale of the Sorcerer's Stone, the first of author J.K. Rowling's incalculably popular books about &quot;The Boy Who Lived.&quot; The videogame take on the book and popular first Potter movie duplicates the action adventure gameplay found in EA's previous Chamber of Secrets title.\n\nDo you missing a game?
