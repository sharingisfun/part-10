Calling their innovative approach to sacred hymns &quot;jubilee&quot; singing, the Golden Gate Quartet, propelled by Willie Johnson and William Langford, enjoyed massive acceptance far outside the church. Their smooth Mills Brothers-influenced harmonies made the Gates naturals for pop crossover success, and they began recording for Victor in 1937. National radio broadcasts and an appearance on John Hammond's 1938 &quot;Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall made them coast-to-coast favorites. By 1941 the Gates were recording for Columbia minus Langford, and movie appearances were frequent: Star Spangled Rhythm, Hollywood Canteen, and Hit Parade of 1943, to name a few. Some experiments with R&amp;B material didn't pan out during the late '40s, and Johnson defected to the Jubilaires in 1948. The group emigrated to France in 1959; led by veteran bass singer Orlando Wilson, the Golden Gate Quartet's vocal blend is as powerful as ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2249820a2f8840cc192e69999c3feff007b711b0","amp;dn":"Golden+Gate+Quartet--Complete+Works+1937-44+%28Document-5CD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2249820a2f8840cc192e69999c3feff007b711b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,73,130,10,47,136,64,204,25,46,105,153,156,63,239,240,7,183,17,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
