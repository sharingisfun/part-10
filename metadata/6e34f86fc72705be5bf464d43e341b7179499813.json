Thorne resists repeatedly, but finally yields to temptation. Jennifer, feeling rejected later, accuses the professor of a sexual assault. A journal she has been keeping, fantasizing about a lover, makes it appear that she and the professor have been carrying on a long affair, placing Thorne's reputation and future in grave danger.\n\nDirected by: George Miller\nWritten By: Gerard Maguire , Lance Peters\nCast: \nJimmy Smits as Justin Thorne\nNaomi Watts as Jennifer Carter\nSarah Chadwick as Laura Thorne\nAdrian Wright as Kenneth Carter\nRoss Williams as David Guilde\nGoran Stamenkovic as Oliver Thorne\nLanguage: English\nCountry: Australia \nAlso known as: Gross Indecency, Ãï¿½ÃÂ¼ÃÂ¾Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ°ÃÂ»Ã‘Å’ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂµ ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¾ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ¸ÃÂµ, RelaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Perigosa, VerfÃƒÂ¼hrt - Schuldig oder nicht schuldig?, Conducta inmoral, Atto indecente, Cattiva condotta, OfÃƒÂ¶rsvarligt upptrÃƒÂ¤dande\nRating: R\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\nIn Theaters: Jul 29, 1993 Wide\nRuntime: 1 hr. 45 min.\n\n\n&quot;Gross Misconduct is based on a play, Assault With A Deadly Weapon, by Lance Peters, adapted for the screen by actor Gerard Maguire. It was directed by George Miller (Man from Snowy River, Bushfire Moon and many Disney features). The musical score is by Bruce Rowland, who also wrote the music for The Man from Snowy River.\n\nThe film is based on a Hobart case of the 1950s, an accusation against an academic, Sydney Sparkes Orr, for gross misconduct. The screenplay has been adapted to Melbourne of the '90s - and filmed at Ormond College where, in fact, a case for sexual harassment against the Master of the college was heard in 1991, other complaints were made in 1995 - and novelist Helen Garner published a book about the issues, The First Stone.\n\nJimmy Smits of LA Law was brought to Australia for the central role and the character made to be an American who fitted into Australian society. Naomi Watts, who featured in Brides of Christ and then went to America for films like Tank Girl, is effective as the fantasising teenager. Sarah Chadwick (with American accent) leads the supporting cast.&quot;\n\n\nInfo:\n\n[mediainfo]\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 2\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nBit rate : 1 920 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.250\nStream size : 1.24 GiB (91%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 127 MiB (9%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 250 ms (6.25 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duratio : 222 ms\n\n[/mediainfo]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e34f86fc72705be5bf464d43e341b7179499813","amp;dn":"Gross+Misconduct+%2F+Gross+Indecency+%281993%29+Naomi+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e34f86fc72705be5bf464d43e341b7179499813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,52,248,111,199,39,5,190,91,244,100,212,62,52,27,113,121,73,152,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
