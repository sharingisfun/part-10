And I just have some sort of feeling that he was - I don't know how or why - but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The conclusion of this is simple; Buddy Holly is in no uncertain terms a musical legend. As an artist he is a primary influence behind The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones, even if his music were near unlistenable his name would be cemented in musical history for that alone. \n\nAs with any artist of this stature there is a certain mystique that surrounds their music and honest opinions (most notably negative ones) are hard to come by. Just look at The Beatles, how can anyone say the Beatles made bad music, when they are The Beatles; the biggest, most significant and most successful musical act of all time? Thankfully such moral dilemmas are of no issue here because in addition to being massively musical significant Holly was also a hugely talented and innovative musician in his own right, and that is an often understated aspect of his legacy. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bf81038b437f54bf029357469b9544330f727ce","amp;dn":"Buddy+Holly+and+The+Crickets+-+The+%26quot%3BChirping%26quot%3B+Crickets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bf81038b437f54bf029357469b9544330f727ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,248,16,56,180,55,245,75,240,41,53,116,105,185,84,67,48,247,39,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
