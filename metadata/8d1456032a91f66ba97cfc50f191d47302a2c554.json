Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances surrounding AshleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and death, McGrath comes face-to-face with the legacy of her father: the legendary, reclusive cult-horror-film director Stanislas CordovaÃ¢â‚¬â€a man who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been seen in public for more than thirty years.\n\nFor McGrath, another death connected to this seemingly cursed family dynasty seems more than just a coincidence. Though much has been written about CordovaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark and unsettling films, very little is known about the man himself.\n\nDriven by revenge, curiosity, and a need for the truth, McGrath, with the aid of two strangers, is drawn deeper and deeper into CordovaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eerie, hypnotic world.\n\nThe last time he got close to exposing the director, McGrath lost his marriage and his career. This time he might lose even more.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready.
