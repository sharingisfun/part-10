Now Gerrit LaningaÃ¢â‚¬â€a man who puts God and country above all elseÃ¢â‚¬â€arrives at her house, needing help. She is terrified for herself and terrified for her family, but most of all, terrified of the pain she might feel again if she allows herself to love Gerrit. Her hope is to be free from her paralyzing fear.\n\nGerrit is a known and hunted Dutch Resistance member. When he comes to CorneliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home for shelter, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawn to her strength and kindness. When he asks her to contact the local Resistance on his behalf, she refuses. Gerrit is determined to find a way to continue his underground work without putting Cornelia or her family in harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way.\n\nWhen things start to unravel and GerritÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life depends on her actions, she must summon her courage and learn to depend on the perfect love that drives out all fear. But will her new love be snatched away before it has a chance to bloom?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96ce4619d70f020d8e1d6d7dc19ec8f505671a70","amp;dn":"Snow+on+the+Tulips+-+Liz+Tolsma.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96ce4619d70f020d8e1d6d7dc19ec8f505671a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,206,70,25,215,15,2,13,142,29,109,125,193,158,200,245,5,103,26,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
