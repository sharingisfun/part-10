They began performing together in 1959, married in 1964, and divorced and stopped performing together in 1975\n\nIan &amp; Sylvia started performing together in Toronto in 1959. By 1962, they were living in New York City where they caught the attention of manager Albert Grossman, who managed Peter, Paul and Mary and would soon become Bob Dylan's manager. Grossman secured them a contract with Vanguard Records and they released their first album late in the year.\n\nIan &amp; Sylvia's first and self-titled album on Vanguard Records consisted mainly of traditional songs. There were British and Canadian folk songs, spiritual music, and a few blues songs thrown into the mix. The album was moderately successful and they made the list of performers for the 1963 Newport Folk Festival.\n\nFour Strong Winds, their second album, was similar to the first, with the exception of the inclusion of the early Dylan composition, &quot;Tomorrow is a Long Time&quot;, and the title song &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, which was written by Ian. &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; was a major hit in Canada and ensured their stardom.\n\nIan and Sylvia married in June 1964. They also released their third album, Northern Journey, that year. The album included a blues song written by Sylvia, &quot;You Were On My Mind&quot;, which was subsequently recorded by both the California group We Five (a 1965 #1 on the Cashbox chart, #3 on the Billboard Hot 100) and British folk-rock singer Crispian St. Peters (#36 in 1967). A recording of &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; by Bobby Bare made it to #3 on the country charts around that time.\n\nOn the Northern Journey album was the song &quot;Someday Soon&quot;, a composition by Ian that would rival &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; in its popularity. Both songs would eventually be recorded by dozens of singers.\n\nTheir fourth album, Early Morning Rain, consisted in large part of new songs. They introduced the work of fellow Canadian songwriter and performer Gordon Lightfoot through the title song and &quot;(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me&quot;. They also recorded songs &quot;Darcy Farrow&quot; by Steve Gillette and Tom Campbell, being the first artists to record these three songs. Additionally, they recorded a number of their own compositions.\n\nThey performed at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Play One More their offering of 1965, showed a move toward the electrified folk-like music that was becoming popular with groups like the Byrds and the Lovin' Spoonful. The title tune used horns for a mariachi effect.\n\nIn 1967, they released two albums, one recorded for Vanguard, the other for MGM. These two efforts, So Much For Dreaming and Lovin' Sound, were far less dynamic presentations. At this time they were doing a weekly TV program for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nAlbums:\n1962\tIan &amp; Sylvia\n1963    Four Strong Winds\n1964    Northern Journey\n1965\tEarly Morning Rain\n1966\tPlay One More\n1967    So Much for Dreaming\n1967    Lovin' Sound\n1968    Nashville\n1968    Full Circle     \n\nAll albums MP3@320\n\nThey were originally released by Vanguard Records (Lovin' Sound &amp; Full Circle released by MGM Records)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f03a5c7b2f94840b2ddb18214e787d2a83d9220","amp;dn":"Ian+%26amp%3B+Sylvia+-+Discography+1962-68+%28MP3%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f03a5c7b2f94840b2ddb18214e787d2a83d9220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,3,165,199,178,249,72,64,178,221,177,130,20,231,135,210,168,61,146,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
