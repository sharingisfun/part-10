Due to their abundance, diversity and rapid response to environmental changes, insects are also valuable indicators of wider biodiversity, and make excellent models for conservation research and monitoring. Over 50 international experts have contributed to this authoritative and up-to-date compendium, covering many topics including climate change, habitat management, ecosystem processes, conservation genetics, impact of GM technology, and the integration of insects into wider conservation agendas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:882233b7cc3819b5e14cf3dd2a9ad20c287bfdc4","amp;dn":"Insect+Conservation+Biology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"882233b7cc3819b5e14cf3dd2a9ad20c287bfdc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,34,51,183,204,56,25,181,225,76,243,221,42,154,210,12,40,123,253,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
