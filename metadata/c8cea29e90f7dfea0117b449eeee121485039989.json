Contests between predators and prey are among the most dramatic events in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  The Hardest Challenge \r\nThis episode reveals the extraordinary range of techniques predators use to catch their prey - from a leopard using all its powers of stealth to stalk impala in broad daylight to wild dogs, whose tactic is to wear down their prey over long distances; from Nile crocodiles, perhaps the planet's most patient predators, to killer whales who use teamwork and intelligence to take on humpback whales. But even with these finely tuned strategies, the outcome is far from certain. Most predators fail most of the time.\r\n\r\n2)  In the Grip of the Seasons (Arctic) \r\nThis episode looks at the challenges of hunting in the Arctic, the most seasonal place on Earth. To a predator, seasonal change is a problem. It means that all the parameters of the hunt - the conditions, the strategies, the prey - change too. The only option for the Arctic's top predators, the wolf, the Arctic fox and the polar bear, is to continually adapt to their changing world, exploiting the good times and enduring the bad.\r\n\r\n3)  Hide and Seek (Forests) \r\nThis episode follows tigers, harpy eagles, chimpanzees, army ants and other predators as they rise to the challenge of hunting within the forest - a dense, confusing, three-dimensional world, one in which even finding prey is a maddening task. The prize for succeeding at nature's great game of hide-and-seek is one worth winning. Forests cover one third of the land surface, and concealed within are over half of the species on Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/93/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/The-Hunt-BBC-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\nVideo: Codec: x264 CAVLC   \r\nVideo: Bitrate: 1514 Kbps\r\nVideo: Resolution: 832 x 468\r\nVideo: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\r\nAudio: Codec: AAC LC\r\nAudio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\nAudio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\r\nAudio: English\r\nRun-Time: 59mins\r\nFramerate: 25 fps\r\nNumber of Parts: 7\r\nPart Size 681 MB\r\nContainer: Mp4\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nEncoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0342d1x","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cea29e90f7dfea0117b449eeee121485039989","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Hunt+3of7+Hide+and+Seek+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cea29e90f7dfea0117b449eeee121485039989","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,206,162,158,144,247,223,234,1,23,180,73,238,238,18,20,133,3,153,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
