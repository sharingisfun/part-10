We believe that as students explore and analyze words, their higher -level thinking skills will grow along with their working vocabulary. Knowing more words and learning how to use them may ultimately help students perform better on standardized tests. We also hope that this book will help kids embrace the pure joy of language.\n\nEach fully treated word is presented in a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œquartetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of four words that share some common link and the link itself may be whimsical. You can use the words one at a time or as a group.  As for the other 68 words, most appear in a recurring feature we call ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn a Word.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ About two thirds of the word quartets are followed by an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn a WordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ reproducible that introduces at least one word linked to one or more of the words in the quartet. These invite students to think, write, or draw as they learn about etymology, word play, classification, or usage.\n\nThe book ends with a comprehensive word list, in alphabetical order, of all words presented. You can seek out particular words by starting there. We hope this book supports your efforts to bring words to life in your classroom, and that it will entice students to acquire and embrace vivid vocabulary.\n\nGRADES 4 TO 8 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c1e8bfd2a09ace9556c1d55ca39f07288d35ea","amp;dn":"Vocabulary+-+Word+of+the+Day.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c1e8bfd2a09ace9556c1d55ca39f07288d35ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,193,232,191,210,160,154,206,149,86,193,213,92,163,159,7,40,141,53,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
