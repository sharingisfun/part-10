We believe that  orchestration and automation are becoming increasingly important in IT organizations of all sizes  and across all infrastructure types ranging from on-premises to cloud-based. Orchestration and  automation can help reduce the cost of IT while improving consistency and quality of IT service  delivery. Like any powerful technology. however, it can be both used and abused.  Our objective with this book is to provide a framework for runbook design and IT process  automation to help you get the most out of System Center Orchestrator 2012 and to help you\n utilize Orchestrator in concert with the rest of the System Center for an enterprise-wide and  systematic approach to process automation. We will provide detailed guidance for creating  what we call Ã¢â‚¬Å“modular automationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where small, focused pieces of automation are  progressively built into larger and more complex solutions. We detail the concept of an  automation library, where over time enterprises build a progressively larger library of  interoperable runbooks and components. Finally, we will cover advanced scenarios and design  patterns for topics like error handling and logging, state management, and parallelism. But\n before we dive into the details, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll begin by setting the stage with a quick overview of  System Center 2012 Orchestrator and deployment scenarios.\n\n\nBook Details : \n\nSize : 9.2 Mb\nPages : 182\nTitle : Microsoft Press ebook System Center Designing Orchestrator Runbooks\nLanguage : English\nFormat : pdf\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\nhttp:// www. facebook. com/ torrentsharing\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d2401c4be485ae9bacd9fbe75efa1eba267220d","amp;dn":"+Microsoft+Press+ebook+System+Center+Designing+Orchestrator+Runb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d2401c4be485ae9bacd9fbe75efa1eba267220d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,36,1,196,190,72,90,233,186,205,159,190,117,239,161,235,162,103,34,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
