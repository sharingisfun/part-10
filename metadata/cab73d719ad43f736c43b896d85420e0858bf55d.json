The paramount reason for daily meditation is to get into the gap between our thoughts, and make conscious contact with the creative energy of life itself. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explains the soul-nourishing meditation technique for making conscious contact with God, which the ancient masters have told us about.\nYou have the potential to be an instrument of the highest good for all concerned and to be a literal miracle worker in your own life. No person, government, or religion can legitimately claim to do this for you. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn fact,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Dr. Dyer, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI agree with Carl Jung who said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“One of the main functions of formalized religion is to protect people against a direct experience of God.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ When you master getting into the gap and staying there for prolonged segments of meditation, and experience what you bring back to the material world, you will know your answer to the question: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy meditate?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n&quot;One quality that distinguishes our Source from the outer world is that it cannot be divided. Oneness defies being compartmentalized. For instance, our physical world is divided into dark and light, but the source of light, the sun, defies division. Or consider the nature of silence. It has been said that God&amp;#039;s one and only voice is silence. No matter how you attempt to slice it up or cut it in half, silence is always silence. This indivisible root source of oneness is where the act of creation originates.\n\n&quot;Indivisible oneness is the creative energy that turns a seed into a maple tree or a watermelon or a human being or anything else that&amp;#039;s alive. It&amp;#039;s invisible, omnipresent, and absolutely indivisible. We can&amp;#039;t divide oneness. Meditation offers us the closest experience we can have of rejoining our Source and being in the oneness at the same time that we&amp;#039;re embodied. This means that we have to tame our ego.\n\nWhen we meditate, we begin to still the mind. As we get more and more adept at moving into inner silence, we come to know the peace of God in our entire being. We intuitively seek union with our generating Source. Silence, or meditation, is the path to that center. We can make conscious contact with God, transcend the limitations of a dichotomous world, and regain the power that is only available to us when we&amp;#039;re connected to the Source. This is what I call getting in the gap. It&amp;#039;s where we create, manifest, heal, live, and perform at a miraculous level. The gap is the powerful silence we can access through meditation. By entering the elusive gap between our thoughts, we can access the stillness that may have been unattainable in other meditation attempts.&quot;---Wayne Dyer ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cab73d719ad43f736c43b896d85420e0858bf55d","amp;dn":"Getting+in+the+Gap+Meditation--Wayne+Dyer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cab73d719ad43f736c43b896d85420e0858bf55d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,183,61,113,154,212,63,115,108,67,184,150,216,84,32,224,133,139,245,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
