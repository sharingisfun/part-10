While his approach to philosophy and the notorious difficulty of his work made him controversial, he is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy.\n\nDerrida had a significant influence upon the humanities and social sciences, including -- in addition to philosophy and literature -- law, anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, political theory, religious studies, feminism, and gay and lesbian studies.  His work still has a major influence in the academe of Continental Europe, South America and all other countries where continental philosophy is predominant, particularly in debates around ontology, epistemology (especially concerning social sciences), ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and the philosophy of language.  He also influenced architecture (in the form of deconstructivism), music, art, and art criticism.\n\n\nThis is an enlarged and thoroughly revised version of my earlier Derrida collection, now consisting of 70 books and 55 journal articles, and including many new or reprocessed scans.
