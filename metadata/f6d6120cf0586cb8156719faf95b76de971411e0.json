A place with gates that lead anywhere in existence, provided \r\nyou have the proper key. It is a neutral ground and a watering hole for races \r\nacross the multiverse, all under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the \r\nenigmatic ruler of the city.

Get outside the city and \r\nthere's the planes themselves: the throne of the gods, the battleground of the \r\neternal Blood War, and home to more horrors and wonders than ever existed on \r\nany Prime Material World.
