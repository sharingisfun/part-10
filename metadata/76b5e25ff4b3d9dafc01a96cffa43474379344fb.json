Picturesque... is a psychedelic effort that tries to imitate the sound bands like the Bee Gees or the Beatles were doing at the moment. With this record, Status Quo surprisingly had its first (and last) hit in America, the single &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men,&quot; which peaked at number 12 (it reached number seven on the British charts). Other highlights from the album are the second single, &quot;Ice in the Sun,&quot; and the Bee Gees cover &quot;Spicks and Specks.&quot; Even if this is not the most representative album from Status Quo, it is a good psychedelic pop exercise that sometimes includes very imaginative guitar phrases (&quot;Ice in the Sun&quot;), and some brilliantly unusual sounds (the epic &quot;Paradise Flat&quot;).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b5e25ff4b3d9dafc01a96cffa43474379344fb","amp;dn":"Status+Quo+-+Picturesque+Matchstickable+Messages+From+the+++Stat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b5e25ff4b3d9dafc01a96cffa43474379344fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,181,226,95,244,179,217,218,252,1,169,108,255,164,52,116,55,147,68,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
