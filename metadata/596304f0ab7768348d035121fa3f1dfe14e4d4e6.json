Q. Pilson\nCambridge University Press | January 2013 | ISBN 978-0-521-88707-6 | PDF | 529 pages | 10.5 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Chemistry-Sea-ebook/dp/B00ADP71PO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Chemistry-Sea-ebook/dp/B00ADP71PO&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFully updated and expanded, this new edition provides students with an accessible introduction to marine chemistry. It highlights geochemical interactions between the ocean, solid earth, atmosphere and climate, enabling students to appreciate the interconnectedness of Earth's processes and systems and elucidates the huge variations in the oceans' chemical environment, from surface waters to deep water. Written in a clear, engaging way, the book provides students in oceanography, marine chemistry and biogeochemistry with the fundamental tools they need for a strong understanding of ocean chemistry. Appendices present information on seawater properties, key equations and constants for calculating oceanographic processes. New to this edition are end-of-chapter problems for students to put theory into practice, summaries to allow easy review of material and a comprehensive glossary. Supporting online resources include solutions to problems and figures from the book.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gso.uri.edu/files/profile-images/Pilson_Michael_E_Q.jpg?0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gso.uri.edu/files/profile-images/Pilson_Michael_E_Q.jpg?0&lt;/a&gt;\nPh.D., Marine Biology, M.S., Agr.
