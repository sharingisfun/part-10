If that sounds corny, it is, a bit, but it's hard not to be swept up film's high spirits. All the original elements of the three-strip photography are long gone or beyond repair and this 2012 release was created from a 35mm copy (with all three Cinerama panels) in a Norwegian film museum. The visual and sound have been restored as much as possible, and the film has been mastered in &quot;Smile-box&quot; to simulate what it looked like in Cinerama. While it sometimes comes across now as &quot;Glee at Sea,&quot; it's still enjoyable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18bda3a91fb217e77f2d0b738fc647afc2b27e28","amp;dn":"Windjammer+%28Cinerama%29+1958","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18bda3a91fb217e77f2d0b738fc647afc2b27e28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,189,163,169,31,178,23,231,127,45,11,115,143,198,71,175,194,178,126,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
