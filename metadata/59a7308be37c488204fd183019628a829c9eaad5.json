With a live CD recorded during the 2003 presentation of the album and a DVD rappresentation from the same dates.\n\nOn 21 February 2006, Kristoffer GildenlÃƒÂ¶w was asked to leave the band due to him not being able to attend rehearsals, since he lived in Holland and the band lived in Sweden. Kristoffer has a solo album planned for the future, as well as a side project called Dial.\n\nThe new album, Scarsick, was released on January 22, 2007. It is more band oriented than BE, with Daniel GildenlÃƒÂ¶w playing bass in the studio. Recent interviews with Daniel have revealed that Scarsick is, in fact, the second part of The Perfect Element, confirming the speculation of many fans.\n\nA European tour to support the new album has been announced (it started February 17, 2007). The band will be playing with Simon Andersson, a new replacement bassist on this tour. On the 10th of March, after the Copenhagen show, Simon Andersson was welcomed into Pain of Salvation as a full member. The band issued this message on their website:\n\nHe (Simon Andersson) did an outstanding job on the tour and we are looking forward to the coming years with great anticipation. Since his girlfriend is a huge Pain of Salvation fan, we happily expect to see this decision put a little silver lining on their sex life as well, since she can now all of a sudden go to bed with a member of the band.\nCongratulations Simon, and welcome to the family!\n\nIn May 2007 it was announced that drummer Johan Langell had decided to leave the band to spend more time with his family.01-Of Two Beginnings.mp3 \t4.40 MB\n02-Ending Theme.mp3 \t9.14 MB\n03-Fandango.mp3 \t10.74 MB\n04-A Trace of Blood.mp3 \t15.18 MB\n05-This Heart of Mine (I Pledge).mp3 \t7.34 MB\n06-Thorn Clown (Japanese Bonus).mp3 \t13.54 MB\n07-Undertow.mp3 \t8.83 MB\n08-Rope Ends.mp3 \t12.89 MB\n09-Chain Sling.mp3 \t7.28 MB\n10-Dryad of the Woods.mp3 \t9.06 MB\n11-Remedy Lane.mp3 \t4.15 MB\n12-Waking Every God.mp3 \t9.76 MB\n13-Second Love.mp3 \t7.99 MB\n14-Beyond the Pale.mp3 \t18.21 MB            \nLine Up:\nDaniel Gildenlow - Vocals/Guitar\nJohan Hallgren - Guitar/Vocals\nKristoffer Gildenlow - Bass/Vocals\nFredrik Hermansson - Keyboards\nJohan Langell - Drums\n\n\n&quot;Remedy Lane&quot; begins with track one, and goes into three chapters:\nChapter One: tracks two through six.\nChapter Two: tracks seven through ten.\nChapter Three: tracks eleven through fourteen.\n\nRecorded at Roasting House.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a7308be37c488204fd183019628a829c9eaad5","amp;dn":"Pain+Of+Salvation+-+Remedy+Lane+%28Japanese+Edition%29++mp3++320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a7308be37c488204fd183019628a829c9eaad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,167,48,139,227,124,72,130,4,253,24,48,25,98,138,130,156,158,170,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
