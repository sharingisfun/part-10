Although essentially a high fantasy, Bone often displays comic humor, particularly the Great Cow Race in issue #10, and PhoneyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s ongoing efforts to become rich off the credulous valley residents. The series tended to become more serious and adventurous as it went on, and the humor became a lesser element in the story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81364f8cae6feae496e8bc7aed53d5403852785","amp;dn":"Bone+%28comics%29+%231-7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81364f8cae6feae496e8bc7aed53d5403852785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,19,100,248,202,230,254,174,73,110,139,199,174,213,61,84,3,133,39,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
