It played to Ann PeeblesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ great strength, her poised and sultry voice, and surrounded by the sparse, easy funkiness of the trademark Hi rhythm section and producer Willie MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect use of horns and strings, she sings like a resilient but disappointed angel on this impressive set of songs about the darker side of love. Her best song is here, the eccentric but brilliant &quot;I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stand the Rain,&quot; along with a marvellous version of Joe SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;(You Keep Me) HanginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On,&quot; and perfect readings of a pair of Earl Randle songs, &quot;If We CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Trust Each Other&quot; and &quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down.&quot; Peebles sings her heart out, and with those somehow bright-sounding Hi grooves behind her, it all comes together to make a classic album of dark, bouncy, and beautiful Southern soul.
