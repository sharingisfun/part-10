The series was subsequently aired in North America on the Discovery Channel, with Branagh's voice replaced with that of Avery Brooks. \n\nThe series used computer-generated imagery and animatronics to recreate the life of the Mesozoic, showing dinosaurs in a way that previously had only been seen in feature films. The program's aim was to simulate the style of a nature documentary and therefore does not include &quot;talking head&quot; interviews. The series used paleontologists such as Peter Dodson, Peter Larson and James Farlow as advisors.\n\n \n\n \n\nEpisodes:\n\n1. &quot;New Blood&quot;\n2. &quot;Time of the Titans&quot;\n3. &quot;Cruel Sea&quot;\n4. &quot;Giant of the skies&quot;\n5. &quot;Spirits of the Ice Forest&quot;\n6. &quot;Death of a Dynasty&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Report: \n\nStreams (Header) : 2\nStreams Found : 2\nLength (s) : 1,756\nTotal Frames : 42,105\nResolution (Header) : 704 x 396\nFlags : Has Index, Is Interleaved, Trust CK Type\n\nVideo Size (kB) : 289,839.96\nAudio Size (kB) : 27,437.50\n\n\n------- Video Stream -------\n\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4\nFlags : None Set\nQuality : 0\nbps : 1,352,146\n\nFOURCC : XVID\nResolution : 704 x 396\nFPS : 23.97602\nBPP : 24\n\n\n------- Audio Stream -------\n\nCodec : MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nFlags : None Set\nQuality : 0\nbps : 128,000\n\nCodec Code : 85\nChannels : 2\nSamplePerSec : 48,000\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdfb3d71d79857d9018d3e7a16af003814147d8c","amp;dn":"Walking+with+Dinosaurs++%28BBC+1999+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdfb3d71d79857d9018d3e7a16af003814147d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,251,61,113,215,152,87,217,1,141,62,122,22,175,0,56,20,20,125,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
