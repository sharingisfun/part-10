This version works with OS X 10.7 and iTunes 10.5.3 It is also the first version of Requiem that can remove the DRM from iBooks. I haven\\'t tested personally (yet!) but I trust Brahms when he says it works. This torrent contains the Mac version, the Windows version, and the source code. (Brahms open sourced it) Enjoy!\n---------------\ninfo from the readme file:\n===\nRequiem has a Tor website: http://tag3ulp55xczs3pn.onion.
