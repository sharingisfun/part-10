Thereâ€™s one major distinction, however, that separates her from other similarly studied musicians. That is Hollyâ€™s devotion to the legendary rock band Phish. Having attended over 300 shows by the Burlington-based quartet, she became obsessed by their famous rendition of â€œTweezerâ€ from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013. It led Holly to transcribe this 37-minute improvisational masterpiece note-for-note and arrange it for solo piano. The process, both painstaking and fulfilling, inspired her to transform other Phish songs and well-known live jams into solo piano interpretations. That journey has ultimately led to her debut album, Distillation Of A Dream: The Music Of Phish Reimagined For Solo Piano, a 2-CD set featuring 15 songs, three of which were transcribed from live renditions, including the initial 7/31/13 â€œTweezerâ€ that was the impetus for it all. Hollyâ€™s breathtaking interpretations of Phish classics like â€œMy Friend, My Friend,â€ â€œThe Squirming Coilâ€ and â€œHarry Hoodâ€ are paired with deeper cuts like â€œTalk,â€ â€œSleepâ€ and â€œThe Inlaw Josie Wales.â€ The recordings serve not only as a tribute to the modern day kings of jam, but stand on their own as fully developed classical pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc 1:\r\n1.
