The film, however, also has a parallell dimension - a karaoke song contest among the trailer people which is what gives this film its comic relief aspect, especially if you are familiar with the Swedish society and its love of cheesy pop culture, be it American country evergreens, Eurotrash or home grown musical pearls. \n\nThe result is quite entertaining. As it&amp;#039;s a short film (about 30 minutes), I won&amp;#039;t give away too many details, but you may want to pay attention to the main karaoke guy&amp;#039;s hairdo and the contestants&amp;#039; choice of songs. \n\n\nSometimes, a step in the right direction means forging a whole new path. &quot;Holding Trevor&quot; is continually poignant, relentlessly self-deprecating, and just the type of cerebral dark comedy that can speak directly to the twenty-somethings of today while letting other generations in on the joke. \n\nA Swedish summer night. A camping site somewhere in Sweden. The grand emotions, the little person, the first love, trailers, karaoke and a birdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ This is the story of Olle who, in spite of his insecurities and fears, finally finds the courage to express his love. In his own way. \n\nI got the idea for the film while reading a review of my car, a Mitsubishi Carisma, in a car magazine. Technically, it stood up well, but apparently the car lacked charisma. I felt sorry for my dull car. Suddenly an image appeared before me of an uncharismatic bird flapping about in a trailer. My thoughts wandered futher, to the summer when I toured camping sites as a drag queen. Karaoke, beer and strands of lights. My doomed teenage crush one summer night in 1989 somewhere in Germany. ThatÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s basically how the film came to be. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66a0471a5d6f297a2af14b802de346f35c0b2f84","amp;dn":"Lucky+Blue+%28Sweden%2C+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66a0471a5d6f297a2af14b802de346f35c0b2f84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,160,71,26,93,111,41,122,42,241,75,128,45,227,70,243,92,11,47,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
