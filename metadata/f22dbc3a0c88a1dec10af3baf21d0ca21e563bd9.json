Tense, repetitive\r\nlicks give way to murky drones or moments where all five musicians seem to be\r\nimprovising independently. But even at its busiest, the music sustains its\r\nfocus and indicates that Gerry Hemingwayâ€™s writing can stand side-by-side with\r\nhis recorded history as a wild, propulsive drummer.\r\n\r\nLongtime collaborators Ellery Eskelin (tenor saxophone) and Kermit Driscoll\r\n(alternating acoustic bass and electric bass guitar) join Hemingway, along with\r\nguitarist Terrence McManus and Oscar Noriega, the latter of whom adds a piquant\r\ntexture to the music on clarinet, bass clarinet and alto saxophone. The leader\r\nblows some murky harmonica to unwrap â€œGitar,â€ a 12-minute piece that builds up\r\nfrom this swampy sound into a spare spotlight for Eskelinâ€™s dynamic\r\nvocabulary. This contrasts with â€œMeddle Music,â€ a shorter piece which McManus\r\nshapes into a strong slab of overdriven psych-rock. The minute-long gap between\r\nthe last two tracks was a wise choice since theyâ€™re similar and represent a big\r\ndeparture from the program. â€œBackabackaâ€ finds the drummer playing a straight\r\n4/4 African kwela grooveâ€”which resembles ska thanks to the off-beat horn\r\nriffâ€”but drags on just a little too long. â€œChicken Bloodâ€ is also repetitive,\r\nbut has a bit more variety with its parallel guitar and horn melodies. Somehow\r\nHemingway makes these contrasts, and the false ending, make sense in the\r\ncontext of this strong release.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Mark Corroto \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/riptide-gerry-hemingway-clean-feed-records-review-by-mark-corroto.php\r\n\r\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\r\n\r\nBy Florence Wetzel \nhttp://www.squidsear.com/cgi-bin/news/newsView.cgi?newsID=1391\r\n\r\nBy Troy Collins \nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD36/PoD36MoreMoments4.html\r\n\r\nGuy Peters (nl)\r\n\r\nJoachim Ceulemans (nl) \nhttp://www.kwadratuur.be/cdbesprekingen/detail/gerry_hemingway_quintet_-_riptide/\r\n\r\nPar FreddieJazz (fr)\r\n\r\nPar Jean Buzelin (fr) \nhttp://www.culturejazz.fr/spip.php?article1824","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22dbc3a0c88a1dec10af3baf21d0ca21e563bd9","amp;dn":"Gerry+Hemingway+Quintet+-+Riptide+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22dbc3a0c88a1dec10af3baf21d0ca21e563bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,45,188,58,12,136,161,222,193,10,243,186,242,29,12,162,30,86,59,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
