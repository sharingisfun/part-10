When Wilson was 24, Gollancz published The Outsider (1956) which examines the role of the social 'outsider' in seminal works of various key literary and cultural figures. These include Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Hermann Hesse, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, William James, T. E. Lawrence, Vaslav Nijinsky and Vincent Van Gogh and Wilson discusses his perception of Social alienation in their work. The book was a best seller and helped popularize existentialism in Britain. Critical praise though, was short-lived and Wilson was soon widely criticized","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f45c1a88adaaddd4f29d9c2b3d25b4487eeb03","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Colin+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f45c1a88adaaddd4f29d9c2b3d25b4487eeb03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,244,92,26,136,173,170,221,212,242,157,156,43,61,37,180,72,126,235,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
