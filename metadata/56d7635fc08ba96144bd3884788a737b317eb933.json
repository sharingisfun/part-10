Watch him making &quot;Dead to Me&quot; judgments or showing guests how\nsadly misinformed they are (take that, Anderson Cooper and George Lucas).\nBrash and unapologetic, the Peabody Award-winning The Colbert Report is\nstate of the news commentary, with the passion of a religious revival,\nand the subtly of a pro-wrestling throw down.\n\nProduced by Comedy Central.\n\n\nStephen commemorates the 40th anniversary of President Nixon's resignation, and\nPat Buchanan and John Dean offer first-hand accounts of the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe.Colbert.Report.2014.08.04.Pat.Buchanan.and.John.Dean.720p.WEBRip.AAC2.0.H.264\n\nFormat: Matroska Video File (MKV)\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 29.970fps\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:21:29\nFile size: 536 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d7635fc08ba96144bd3884788a737b317eb933","amp;dn":"The.Colbert.Report.2014.08.04.720p.WEBRip.AAC2.0.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d7635fc08ba96144bd3884788a737b317eb933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,215,99,95,192,139,169,97,68,189,56,132,120,138,115,123,49,126,185,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
