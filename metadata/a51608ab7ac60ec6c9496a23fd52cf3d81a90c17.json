That is, everything but art. Most of the great works are lost, and it is up to people like William Shakespear Junior the Fifth to restore the lost artwork of the human race. He finds strange goings-on at a resort enough to remind him of all the lines of the play, dealing with mob boss Don Learo and his daughter Cordelia, a strange professor named Jean Luc-Godard (sic), who repeatedly xeroxes his hand for no particular reason. He is followed by four humanoid goblins that keep tormenting Cordelia. There is also the gentleman whose girlfriend, Valerie, isn't always visible. Then the film is sent off to New York for Mr. Alien to edit.\n\nDirector: Jean-Luc Godard\n\nWriter: William Shakespeare (play)\n\nStars: Woody Allen, Julie Delpy, Jean-Luc Godard, Norman Mailer, Molly Ringwald, Peter Sellars\n\nDVDrip with english audio + .srt portuguese subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a51608ab7ac60ec6c9496a23fd52cf3d81a90c17","amp;dn":"%5B1987%5D+King.Lear.Godard-MKO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a51608ab7ac60ec6c9496a23fd52cf3d81a90c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,22,8,171,122,198,14,198,201,73,106,35,253,82,207,61,129,169,12,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
