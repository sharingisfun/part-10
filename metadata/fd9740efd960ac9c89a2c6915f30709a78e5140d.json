Luke and local chef Dominique Le Stanc ride their bicycles to the local farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ market to collect the ingredients for a delectable onion tart and zucchini flower dish. Going to Nice and not cooking salad NiÃƒÂ§oise would be a sin, so Luke learns how to prepare the real deal in a traditional NiÃƒÂ§oise kitchen. He then takes a stroll along the Promenade des Anglais before heading to the hills to cook with sardines in the traditional way. The three Ã¢â‚¬ËœSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of Nice are: sea, soccer, and socca: Luke discovers the latter is cooked in an ancient wood fire oven. He meets with Nadim and his wife, the proprietors of Oliveira, to discover the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best olive oil and her famous eggplant dip.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 05-Jun-2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd9740efd960ac9c89a2c6915f30709a78e5140d","amp;dn":"Luke.Nguyens.France.S01E07.PDTV.x264-Thena.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd9740efd960ac9c89a2c6915f30709a78e5140d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,151,64,239,217,96,172,156,137,162,198,145,95,48,112,154,120,229,20,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
