For the technology to reach its full potential, however, engineers and researchers from many disciplines must learn to work together through every phase of system development. To date, little effort has been expended, either in practice or in the literature, to eliminate the boundaries that exist between the optics and mechatronics communities.\r\n\r\nThe Opto-Mechatronics Systems Handbook is the first step in that direction. Richly illustrated and featuring contributions from an international panel of experts, it meets three essential objectives:\r\n\r\nÃ– Present the definitions, fundamentals, and applications of the technology\r\n\r\nÃ– Provide a multidisciplinary perspective that shows how optical systems and devices can be integrated with mechatronic systems at all stages, from conceptualization to design and manufacturing\r\n\r\nÃ– Demonstrate the roles and synergistic effects of optical systems in overall system performance\r\n\r\nAlong with his fresh approach and systems perspective, the editor has taken care to address real cutting-edge technologies, including precision opto-mechatronic systems, intelligent robots, and opto-microsensors. Ultimately, the Opto-Mechatronics Systems Handbook provides readers with the technological foundation for developing further innovative products and systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5604fe14bc9baaf4c83d0ecedd3ba92ab9699a","amp;dn":"Opto-Mechatronic+Systems+Handbook+-+Techniques+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5604fe14bc9baaf4c83d0ecedd3ba92ab9699a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,86,4,254,20,188,155,170,244,200,61,14,206,221,59,169,42,185,105,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
