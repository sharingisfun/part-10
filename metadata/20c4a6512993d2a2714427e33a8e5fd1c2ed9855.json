I&amp;#039;m skipping the &quot;Old Republic Era&quot; because it&amp;#039;s only 2 books, shouldn&amp;#039;t be that hard to find.\n\nAll files are packed with Winrar, not to save space but to make it easier to select which audio books you want.\n\nYou will notice that every file has the &quot;bitrate per second&quot; noted (kbps)\nVBR stands for &quot;variable bitrate&quot;, meaning that not every file in the .rar file has the same bitrate.\nThis should make it easier to find out if you already have downloaded a particular audio book. (by comparing your own to the one in this torrent based on file size and bitrate)\n\nI also included 2 programs: &quot;File Renamer Deluxe&quot; &amp; Piston&amp;#039;s &quot;Direct WAV MP3 Splitter&quot; for obvious reasons. \n\nAll files are named properly: [Track number] - [Possible series name] - [Book title].mp3 \n\nAs you can see on this list,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_Audio_Books&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_Audio_Books&lt;/a&gt;\nThis torrent contains all the books for this Era.\n\nIf you download this, then I assume that you are a Star Wars fan.\nRemember that there are other fans out there who also want to download this so please seed as long as possible. \n\n\nThe SOONER this torrent has a good amount of SEEDERS, the SOONER the NEXT ERA will be uploaded.\n\n\nI suggest you bookmark my account (http://thepiratebay.se/user/Starkiller20/) to stay up to date easily.\n\n\nIf you&amp;#039;ve downloaded the previous era (Rise of the Empire) please check out this torrent http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4009876/Star_Wars_Jedi_Quest_fix\nfor a minor &amp;#039;update&amp;#039; if you will. Read all about it there.\n\n\nFeel free to ask questions or criticize.\nI read the comments and will get back to you as soon as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c4a6512993d2a2714427e33a8e5fd1c2ed9855","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+audio+books+-+Rebellion+Era","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c4a6512993d2a2714427e33a8e5fd1c2ed9855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,196,166,81,41,147,210,162,113,68,39,227,58,142,95,209,194,237,152,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
