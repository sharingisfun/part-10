Bound to a feudal lord, a â€œseigneur,â€ for three years in exchange for land, they become wood-cuttersâ€”barkskins. RenÃ© suffers extraordinary hardship, oppressed by the forest he is charged with clearing. He is forced to marry a Miâ€™kmaw woman and their descendants live trapped between two inimical cultures. But Duquet, crafty and ruthless, runs away from the seigneur, becomes a fur trader, then sets up a timber business. Proulx tells the stories of the descendants of Sel and Duquet over three hundred yearsâ€”their travels across North America, to Europe, China, and New Zealand, under stunningly brutal conditionsâ€”the revenge of rivals, accidents, pestilence, Indian attacks, and cultural annihilation. Over and over again, they seize what they can of a presumed infinite resource, leaving the modern-day characters face to face with possible ecological collapse.\r\n\r\nProulxâ€™s inimitable genius is her creation of characters who are so vividâ€”in their greed, lust, vengefulness, or their simple compassion and hopeâ€”that we follow them with fierce attention. Annie Proulx is one of the most formidable and compelling American writers, and Barkskins is her greatest novel, a magnificent marriage of history and imagination","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311139ecf4401d22a328b57821f754e79a0ceee6","amp;dn":"Barkskins+A+Novel+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311139ecf4401d22a328b57821f754e79a0ceee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,17,57,236,244,64,29,34,163,40,181,120,33,247,84,231,154,12,238,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
