Possessing one of music's most distinctive voices, Rod's musical project &quot;The Great American Songbook&quot; series has been a recordbreaking success, selling over 19 million albums and becoming the biggest selling ongoing series of new music recordings in history. \n\nIn 2006, Stewart released Still the Same, Great Rock Classics of Our Time, his first rock album in over eight years, which entered the charts at #1. He has sold out concerts across the globe and his last 5 studio albums have topped the Billboard charts. Rod spent this summer recording the Soulbook album and criss-crossing the country on a 20 city North American tour.\n\nTracks:\n\n01  It's The Same Old Song\n02  My Cherie Amoure [Ft.
