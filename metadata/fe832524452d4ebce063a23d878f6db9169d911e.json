GermanyÃ‚Â´s third ranking international Airport with two parallel runways is the largest and primary airport for the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region - the largest metropolitan region in Germany. With 107 aircraft parking positions available it also is equipped to handle the A380. GermanyÃ‚Â´s top carriers Lufthansa and Air Berlin use this airport as one of their hubs. \n\n\n\nThe airport Dusseldorf comes as an absolute realistic 3D model for Microsoft Flight Simulator X, Prepar3D and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 in its actual real world state. Based on an aerial image from 2012 it contains all buildings and objects. It also incorporates the new taxiway layout and signs as well as the new visual docking systems which had only been installed in August 2012. All textures come in high resolution. Dynamic objects such as apron vehicles, traffic on roads and motorways, trains and trams create this special atmosphere found on this airport.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe832524452d4ebce063a23d878f6db9169d911e","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+-+Mega+Airport+Dusseldorf+X+%5BRIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe832524452d4ebce063a23d878f6db9169d911e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,131,37,36,69,45,78,188,224,99,162,61,135,143,109,185,22,157,145,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
