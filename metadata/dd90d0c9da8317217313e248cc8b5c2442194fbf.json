This industry includes hundreds of participating firms, including asset managers, brokers, consultants, verification agencies and a myriad of other institutions. Universities and other training institutions have responded to this rapid expansion of commodity markets as well as their substantial future growth potential by launching specialized courses on the subject.\n\nThe Economics of Commodity Markets attempts to bridge the gap between academics and working professionals by way of a textbook that is both theoretically informative and practical. Based in part on the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ teaching experience of commodity finance at the University Paris Dauphine, the book covers all important commodity markets topics and includes coverage of recent topics such as financial applications and intuitive economic reasoning.\n\nThe book is composed of three parts that cover: commodity market dynamics, commodities and the business cycle, and commodities and fundamental value. The key original approach to the subject matter lies in a shift away from the descriptive to the econometric analysis of commodity markets. Information on market trends of commodities is presented in the first part, with a strong emphasis on the quantitative treatment of that information in the remaining two parts of the book. Readers are provided with a clear and succinct exposition of up-to-date financial economic and econometric methods as these apply to commodity markets. In addition a number of useful empirical applications are introduced and discussed.\n\nThis book is a self-contained offering, discussing all key methods and insights without descending into superfluous technicalities. All explanations are structured in an accessible manner, permitting any reader with a basic understanding of mathematics and finance to work their way through all parts of the book without having to resort to external sources.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface xi\nList of Figures xiii\n\nList of Tables xvii\n\nAcronyms xxv\n\nPART I COMMODITY MARKET DYNAMICS 1\n\n1 Individual Dynamics: From Trends to Risks 3\n\n1.1 Backwardation, Contango and Commodity Risk Premium 9\n\n1.2 Understanding CommoditiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Momenta 13\n\n1.2.1 Persistence of Shocks in Commodities 18\n\n1.2.2 The Nature of Momentum in Commodity Markets 20\n\n1.2.3 Time Series Momentum and the Number and Nature of Regimes 32\n\n1.3 Volatility to Returns Spillovers and Tail Events in Commodities 43\n\n1.3.1 Spillover Effects in Commodity Markets 43\n\n1.3.2 Twenty Years of Jumps in Commodity Markets 51\n\nReferences 61\n\n2 Cross-Asset Linkages 69\n\n2.1 Common Risk Factors in Commodities 77\n\n2.1.1 Literature Review 78\n\n2.1.2 PCA and the Estimation of the Number of Common Components 80\n\n2.1.3 Empirical Findings 82\n\n2.2 Volatility Spillovers in Commodity Markets 90\n\n2.2.1 The Volatility Spillover Index 96\n\n2.2.2 Four Empirical Applications 98\n\nReferences 110\n\nPART II COMMODITIES AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE 115\n\n3 The Reaction of Commodity Markets to Economic News 117\n\n3.1 Measuring the Impact of Price Discovery on Asset Prices 117\n\n3.2 Key Insights from the Academic Literature 118\n\n3.3 Database of News 119\n\n3.4 An Example: S&amp;P 500, 10Y and USD 121\n\n3.5 Commodity Indices 122\n\n3.6 Dependence on the Business Cycle: NBER Recessions/Expansion Phases 123\n\n3.7 Rolling Analysis 125\n\n3.8 Preliminary Findings 128\n\n3.9 Market-by-Market Analysis 129\n\n3.9.1 Database for Commodity Prices 129\n\n3.9.2 Precious Metals 130\n\n3.9.3 Industrial Metals 132\n\n3.9.4 Energy 135\n\n3.9.5 Agricultural Commodities 138\n\n3.10 Concluding Remarks 143\n\nReferences 143\n\n4 Economic Regimes and Commodity Markets as an Asset Class 145\n\n4.1 Index Performances, the Fed and the NBER Crises 145\n\n4.2 Measuring the Business Cycle 147\n\n4.3 To Which Business Cycle are the Commodity Markets Related?
