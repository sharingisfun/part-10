Referred to as the King of Pop, Jackson is recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His contribution to music, dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, then the Jacksons in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971.\nIn the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, and &quot;Thriller&quot;, were credited with transforming the medium into an art form and a promotional tool, and the popularity of these videos helped to bring the relatively new television channel MTV to fame. Videos such as &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; made him a staple on MTV in the 1990s. Through stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style have influenced numerous hip hop, pop, contemporary R&amp;B, and rock artists.Jackson's 1982 album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. His other records, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame as the first (and currently only) dancer from the world of pop and rock 'n' roll. Some of his other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records; 13 Grammy Awards (as well as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award); 26 American Music Awards (more than any other artist, including the &quot;Artist of the Century&quot;); 13 number-one singles in the United States in his solo career (more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era); and the estimated sale of over 750 million records worldwide. Jackson won hundreds of awards, which have made him the most-awarded recording artists in the history of\n\n.: Michael Jackson :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img695.imageshack.us/img695/363/3057894640px.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img695.imageshack.us/img695/363/3057894640px.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.sumotorrent.com/upload.php#Upload&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.sumotorrent.com/upload.php#Upload&lt;/a&gt;\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1971 Got to Be There @320\n1972 Ben @320\n1973 Music &amp; me @320\n1975 Forever, Michael @320\n1982 Thriller @320\n1984 Farewell My Summer Love (Vinyl rip) @320\n1987 Bad @320\n1991 Dangerous @320\n1995 HIStory-Past, Present and Future-Book1 (Uncensored Release, 2 CD) @320\n2001 Bad (Special Edition) @320\n2001 Dangerous (Special Edition) @320\n2001 Invincible @320\n2001 Off The Wall (Special Edition) @320\n2001 Thriller (Special Edition) @320\n2008 Thriller (25th Anniversary Edition) @320\n\nCompilation albums\n1978 Original Demos From 1978 '45 (2009) @320\n1981 One Day In Your Life @320\n1982 E.T.
