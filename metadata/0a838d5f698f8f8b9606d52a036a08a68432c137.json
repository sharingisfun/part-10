Though its roots are in Hinduism, tantra's goals are the universal ones of self-knowledge and liberated joy. Its methods and effects transcend geography and era. Basing its approach on a historical and explanatory survey, this book deals in a detailed way with astronomy, astrology, alchemy, and cosmology in tantrism. In addition, there is discussion of the different viewpoints of &quot;left-hand&quot; and &quot;right-hand&quot; tantrikas and their respective attitudes towards human sexuality and its place in ritual. The drawings and illustrations serve further to explain and instruct, thus providing a unique opportunity for close contact with one of the world's oldest practical methods of achieving an expanded and creative awareness of oneself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a838d5f698f8f8b9606d52a036a08a68432c137","amp;dn":"The+Tantric+Way+-+Art%2C+Science%2C+Ritual+-+Ajit+Mookerjee+and+Madh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a838d5f698f8f8b9606d52a036a08a68432c137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,131,141,95,105,143,143,139,150,6,213,42,3,106,8,166,132,50,193,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
