She has written some forty books, including the Pax Britannica trilogy about the British Empire; studies of Wales, Spain, Venice, Oxford, Manhattan, Sydney, Hong Kong, and Trieste; six volumes of collected travel essays; two memoirs; two capricious biographies; and a couple of novelsÃ¢â‚¬â€but she defines her entire oeuvre as Ã¢â‚¬Å“disguised autobiography.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She is an honorary D.Litt. of the University of Wales and a Commander of the British Empire.\n\n'The British Empire is fortunate in having found in Morris a chronicler and memorialist who can do it justice. Although it is a sad story, the telling of it is marvellously vigorous and compelling. Morris, like Edward Gibbon, writes with an inspired gusto, firmly rooted in erudition which carries the book into the realms of literature.' Sunday Telegraph\n\nA beautiful book, superbly written in a bitter-sweet style . . . A marvellous account of what the empire was like.' Daily Express\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Pax Britannica Trilogy:\n\n* Heaven's Command - Book 1\n\nJan Morris tells the epic story of the rise of the British Empire, from Queen Victoria's accession in 1837 to her Diamond Jubilee in 1897. In this celebrated masterwork she vividly evokes every aspect of the 'great adventure', ranging from ships and botanical gardens to hill stations and sugar plantations, as she subtly traces the impact of empire on places as diverse as Sierra Leone and Fiji, Zululand and the Canadian prairies.\n\n* Pax Britannica - Book 2\n\nJan Morris recreates the British Empire at its dazzling climax - the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, celebrated as a festival of imperial strength, unity, and splendour. This classic work of history portrays a nation at the very height of its vigour and self-satisfaction, imposing on the rest of the world its traditions and tastes, its idealists and rascals.\n\n* Farewell the Trumpets - Book 3\n\nJan Morris traces the momentous decline and fall of the greatest of empires - from Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee to the death of Winston Churchill in 1965. With characteristic brilliance, this masterpiece of narrative history describes the long retreat and final dissolution of the British Empire.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Command: An Imperial Progress (1973) - Book 1 (Faber &amp; Faber)\n\n* Pax Britannica: The Climax of Empire (1968) - Book 2 (Faber &amp; Faber)\n\n* Farewell the Trumpets: An Imperial Retreat (1978) - Book 3 (Faber &amp; Faber)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Morris&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Morris&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/authors/jan-morris/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/authors/jan-morris/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1251/the-art-of-the-essay-no-2-jan-morris&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1251/the-art-of-the-essay-no-2-jan-morris&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3559244/After-a-life-of-travel-Jan-Morris-is-back-where-he-started.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3559244/After-a-life-of-travel-Jan-Morris-is-back-where-he-started.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af412bbbbbeac1e6f2491d93438f8479daa577cf","amp;dn":"The+Pax+Britannica+Trilogy+-+Jan+Morris+%28Welsh+Author%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af412bbbbbeac1e6f2491d93438f8479daa577cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,65,43,187,187,234,193,230,242,73,29,147,67,143,132,121,218,165,119,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
