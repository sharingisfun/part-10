Joshua James is often compared to Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Bright Eyes or Ray LaMontagne. James is known for his intimate vocal style and bittersweet lyrics, often dealing with tragedy, religion, and substance abuse.\n\nHis original digital release of The Sun is Always Brighter on iTunes reached #1 on the service\\'s Folk Album list in 2007. The album caught the attention of the indie folk scene, with Paste Magazine naming him one of their \\&quot;Next 25 Artists You Need To Know\\&quot; in their September 2008 issue, and prompting artists such as John Mayer, David Gray, Ani DiFranco, and Brett Dennen to have him support their North American tours.\n\nNPR has also recently cited Joshua James in one of their \\&quot;Song of the Day\\&quot; publishings. They featured his \\&quot;The New Love Song\\&quot; as one of the best new songs from a previously unknown artist in a long time.\n\nJoshua headed back to the studio in late 2007 to record his second album, entitled Build Me This, which was released digitally on September 8, 2009, and physically on September 22, 2009, on Intelligent Noise/Northplatte Records. Paste Magazine dubbed the new work \\&quot;phenomenal.\\&quot; iTunes also dubbed Build Me This one of the \\&quot;Best of 2009\\&quot; Indie Spotlight Singer/Songwriter albums.\n\nHe performed at SXSW Music Festival, Bonaroo, and XPoNential Music Festival, Fork Fest, etc. in 2010 in addition to a US tour and shows in Japan and UK. James has also performed at Lollapalooza in 2009.\n\nVariety Magazine calls James \\&quot;a young Midwestern singer-songwriter who writes hard-bitten songs of family tragedies and sings them in a voice thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as sun-bleached and wind-battered as a Nebraska cornfield.\\&quot;\n\nA cover of Herman\\'s Hermits\\' \\&quot;No Milk Today\\&quot; featured in the Season 3 premier of Sons of Anarchy.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_James_%28folk_singer%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_James_%28folk_singer%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006 - B-Sides It\\'s Dark Outside (AAC &amp; MP3@320)\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
