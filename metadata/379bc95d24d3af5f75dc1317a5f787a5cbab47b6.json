For one thing, it doesn't differ all that much from the previous two-CD War best-of on Rhino, Anthology (1970-1994). Sure, each has a few tracks not on the other, but both are built around their lengthy string of big hits. Even Barry Alfonso's accompanying essay was adapted from the liner notes to Anthology (1970-1994). Still, this does have all of the big chart hits and a few minor ones, as well as standout album tracks from throughout the 1970s and early '80s that illustrate the band's versatility. Reading the small print on the track listings, it's revealed that half a dozen of these cuts are edits that either appear here for the first time or were only available on previous anthologies or imports. Additionally, almost a dozen of the other tracks are the edited single versions, though it's unlikely many collectors or fans will be either excited or piqued by differences between these and other available variations.\nAll Music Review by Richie Unterberger  \n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Spill The Wine - - - Eric Burdon &amp; War\n[02] Tobacco Road - - - Eric Burdon &amp; War\n[03] All Day Music\n[04] Slippin' Into Darkness\n[05] Get Down\n[06] Nappy Head\n[07] The World Is A Ghetto\n[08] City, Country, City\n[09] The Cisco Kid\n[10] Where Was You At\n[11] Four Cornered Room\n[12] Gypsy Man\n[13] Me And Baby Brother\n[14] Deliver The Word\n[15] Southern Part Of Texas\n[16] Ballero [Live]\n[17] Why Can't We Be Friends\n\nPlay Time - 01h:09m:31s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Low Rider\n[02] Don't Let No One Get You Down\n[03] Heartbeat\n[04] Smile Happy\n[05] So\n[06] Summer\n[07] L.A.
