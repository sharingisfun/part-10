The album is marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with hip hop, electronica, new wave and girl groups. The album's title is taken directly from a lyric in the song &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; by Hole.\n\nGarbage - Beautiful Garbage (flac) [MentalZero][Eccles] (Size: 357.12 MB)\n \t\t13 So Like a Rose.flac\t37.87 MB\n \t\t11 Nobody Loves You.flac\t34.19 MB\n \t\t03 Can't Cry These Tears.flac\t30.74 MB\n \t\t10 Parade.flac\t28.89 MB\n \t\t05 Cup of Coffee.flac\t28.08 MB\n \t\t06 Silence Is Golden.flac\t26.67 MB\n \t\t12 Untouchable.flac\t26.63 MB\n \t\t08 Breaking Up the Girl.flac\t26.21 MB\n \t\t01 Shut Your Mouth.flac\t25.96 MB\n \t\t04 Til the Day I Die.flac\t24.58 MB\n \t\t09 Drive You Home.flac\t24.37 MB\n \t\t02 Androgyny.flac\t21.62 MB\n \t\t07 Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!).flac\t21.14 MB\n \t\t1 beautiful garbage cover art 02.jpg\t86.33 KB\n \t\t1 beautiful garbage cover art 01.jpg\t82.6 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t2.97 KB\n \t\tGarbage - Beautiful Garbage.m3u\t1.73 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t867 bytes\n \nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 357 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Beautiful Garbage\nTrack name/Total                         : 13\nComposer                                 : Garbage\nGenre                                    : Alternative Rock\nRecorded date                            : October 1, 2001\n\n\n\n===========================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 1058Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98dcbb7797acde9604291086f386e85ff3c37e25","amp;dn":"Garbage+-+Beautiful+Garbage+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D%5BEccles%5D+%28Size%3A+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98dcbb7797acde9604291086f386e85ff3c37e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,220,187,119,151,172,222,150,4,41,16,134,243,134,232,95,243,195,126,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
