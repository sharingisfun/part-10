At the same time it combines the straightforward focus on fundamentals instructors have come to expect with a modern emphasis on design and new applications. Overall coverage of basic concepts are clear and concise so that readers can easily navigate key topics. This edition includes a new case study to help illuminate the complexities of shafts and axles and a new finite elements chapter. Problem sets have been improved, with new problems added to help students progressively work through them. The book website includes ARIS, which is a homework management system that will have 90 algorithmic problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2642d47bce268571e5bfd9f8b8c9702d615291b9","amp;dn":"Mechanical+Engineering+Design+8th+Ed+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2642d47bce268571e5bfd9f8b8c9702d615291b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,66,212,123,206,38,133,113,229,191,217,248,184,201,112,45,97,82,145,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
