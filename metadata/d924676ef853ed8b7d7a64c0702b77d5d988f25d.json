He shouts out what he thinks, and in an effortless style he doesnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t make a mess of it. Sure, some words donÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t have to rhyme but the way Frank delivers it makes it sound perfect. ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Live Fast Die OldÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ is the first track on the new album and itÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a re-phrase of that classic punk song ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Live Fast Die Young.ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Unlike FrankÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s previous albums, this time he records with a full band instead of doing everything himself (except drums and pianos). On most tracks, mandolin, piano, harmonica, organ, drums and bass accompany Frank with his guitar. I believe for the most part Frank Turner just plays by himself at his live shows, but I could be mistaken. The strip down folk punk style would be fitting to hear live but IÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½d love to hear the full band at a show too!\n\nI didnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t really know of Frank Turner until I heard he was coming out with an album on Epitaph. IÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll be honest; itÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s been quite a while since I last loved an album on the label. I think if they continue to sign musicians like Frank Turner, they will get back on track with being a premier punk label. But letÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s get back to Frank shall we? The song that got me hooked was his newest single ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Road.ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ The song just sounded very powerful, catchy and something I could see an entire venue singing along to frantically. His style isnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t all shouting, he actually can sing like on tracks ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Fastest Way Back Home,ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Faithful SonÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Journey Of The Magi.ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Sons of LibertyÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ could be my favorite track after ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Road.ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ I love the subtle piano notes after each verse. The fiddle playing on the track reminds me of the UK folk rockers The Levellers, which I believe Turner is a fan of, Well everyone should be a fan of them but thatÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s neither here nor there.\n\nFrank Turner, 'Poetry Of The Deed' \n\n1.
