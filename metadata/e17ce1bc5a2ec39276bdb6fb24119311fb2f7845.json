Imagine a film that has the look of a German expressionist film of the 1920&amp;#039;s combined with more modern themes and ideas and situations that are just out of left field, and there you ALMOST have it except for the fact that this doesn&amp;#039;t really do it justice either. &quot;Careful&quot; is a film about a small town in the Alps where everyone has to be extra quiet so as not to provoke avalanches. Also thrown in are some incestuous thoughts, butler school, the ghost of a blind father who lost one eye as a baby to a &quot;carelessly pinned broach&quot; and the other to a cuckoo clock (that has a duck instead of a cuckoo), and almost too much else to describe. It has the look and feel of a film made in the 1920&amp;#039;s (with color tinting, I think) and yet one never saw someone cut off their own fingers with pruning shears in any 1920&amp;#039;s movie that i&amp;#039;ve ever seen. It&amp;#039;s a love story, of sorts, but probably not exactly the most wholesome sort of love story. It&amp;#039;s also sort of a comedy, but mostly of the dark variety. I don&amp;#039;t know, I feel rather at a loss to describe most of Maddin&amp;#039;s films, they&amp;#039;re better if you just watch them &amp; try to figure them out yourself. They are very compelling to watch, but you need a sense of adventure and humor to watch them. 8 out of 10 stars, most weird.\n\n-IMdB user comment\n\nThe torrent includes the film and Noam Gonick&amp;#039;s &quot;Waiting For Twilight,&quot; a documentary on Guy Maddin and the making of his &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs,&quot; narrated by Tom Waits.\n\nMy rip.
