Human forces have pushed outward, now taking enemy worlds in response to the attacks on their own, but they don't have the numbers or the power to hold what they take.\n\nNow the alien Alliance shows a sliver of it's true power, and the war for domination of the skies over Hayden burns brightly once more. Neither side has any intentions of giving up the game, and both sides have plenty more aces held back against a rainy day.\n\nA fiery rain is coming, and when it passes the future of the entire Orion-Cygnus Arm of our Galaxy will be decided.\n\nAdmiral Nadine Brooke, Captain Jane MacKay, and Sergeant Sorilla Aida intend to make certain it's decided in humanity's favor.\n\nValkyrie Burning is Book Three of the Hayden War Cycle. Books One and Two are On Silver Wings and Valkyrie Rising. The final novel of the Cycle, Book Four - the Valhalla Call - is scheduled to be released in early 2013.\n\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 7 mins \nRead by Dina Pearlman\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:07-21-15\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:118b0f3539e825a29e109f8c545806917712edbc","amp;dn":"Evan+C.+Currie+-+Valkyrie+Burning+%28Hayden+War+Cycle+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"118b0f3539e825a29e109f8c545806917712edbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,139,15,53,57,232,37,162,158,16,159,140,84,88,6,145,119,18,237,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
