In My Time Of Dying was dedicated to the British Queen. \r\n&quot;Tonight is the beginning of the celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's \r\nSilver Jubilee, and that's heavy thing for us, so we'll do this one \r\nfor Liz!&quot; said Plant to the noisy audience. Kashmir is a little \r\nsloppy but the whole show is really powerful and Jimmy is on fire in \r\nAchilles Last Stand. The drumming is very sloppy in Stairway To Heaven \r\nand everyone chases each other through Rock And Roll, which makes for \r\na very bizarre arrangement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:883389947993478244a30f9c9a824d1fccb56b04","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.06.07+MSG%2C+New+York+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"883389947993478244a30f9c9a824d1fccb56b04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,51,137,148,121,147,71,130,68,163,15,156,154,130,77,31,204,181,107,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
