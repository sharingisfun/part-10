Now updated and expanded, Poorly Made in China reveals industry secrets, including the dangerous practice of quality fadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the deliberate and secret habit of Chinese manufacturers to widen profit margins through the reduction of quality inputs. U.S. importers donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stand a chance, Midler explains, against savvy Chinese suppliers who feel they have little to lose by placing consumer safety at risk for the sake of greater profit. This is a lively and impassioned personal account, a collection of true stories, told by an American who has worked in the country for close to two decades. Poorly Made in China touches on a number of issues that affect us all.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Poorly-Made-China-Insiders-Production/dp/0470928077/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1306593368&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Poorly-Made-China-Insiders-Production/dp/0470928077/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1306593368&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a558bc175d9be41a9dda40938d05ad9fbdd1d0b9","amp;dn":"Poorly+Made+in+China%3A+An+Insider%5C%27s+Account+of+the+China+Product","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a558bc175d9be41a9dda40938d05ad9fbdd1d0b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,88,188,23,93,155,228,26,157,218,64,147,141,5,173,159,189,209,208,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
