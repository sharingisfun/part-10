This fix takes care of a trigger\nwhich makes it impossible to kill the end boss, for those who didn't become\nbored with the game after 15 minutes.\n\n\n1. Unrar.\n2. Copy over the cracked content to your game Bin32 directory.\n3. Use a firewall to block all game exes from going online.\n4. Play the game.\n5. Support the software developers.
