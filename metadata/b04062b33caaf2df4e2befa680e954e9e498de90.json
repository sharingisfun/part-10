These were hugely successful both for the band and Silverstone, making her a household name (and also gaining her the nickname, &quot;the Aerosmith chick&quot;). They also got her noticed by film maker Amy Heckerling, who after seeing them decided to cast her in Clueless.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04062b33caaf2df4e2befa680e954e9e498de90","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Cryin%5C%27++%28with+Alicia+Silverstone%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04062b33caaf2df4e2befa680e954e9e498de90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,64,98,179,60,170,242,223,78,43,239,166,128,233,84,233,228,152,222,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
