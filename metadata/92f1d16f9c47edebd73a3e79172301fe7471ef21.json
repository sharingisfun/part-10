The authors present an overview of the World Health OrganizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework and how to incorporate concepts from this framework into a needs assessment for assistive and access technologies. \n\nThis text is ideal for audiologists, rehabilitationists, speech-language pathologists, and disability specialists as it addresses topics such as legal information and product standards, acoustic issues in a variety of environments, telecommunications access, among others. Also provided is a thorough glossary and examples of setting up hearing assistive technologies. \n\nFrom the Foreword:\n&quot;Drs. Atcherson, Franklin and Smith-Olinde have written a ''must-read'' book about assistive and emerging technologies that can vastly increase the ability of consumers with hearing loss to hear more clearly, communicate more effectively and enhance their quality of life. Although written primarily for hearing health care professionals, consumers, family members and those who interact with people with hearing loss can greatly benefit from understanding how technology, beyond and in conjunction with hearing aids and implantable devices, can provide greater access to more opportunities... \n\n...The authors effectively highlight the power of harnessing new technology for better hearing, removing impediments, and training hearing health care professionals about the possibilities for consumers with hearing loss, not the limitations.&quot; \n\nAnna Gilmore Hall, RN, MS, CAE\nExecutive Director\nHearing Loss Association of America\nBethesda, Maryland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f1d16f9c47edebd73a3e79172301fe7471ef21","amp;dn":"Hearing+Assistive+and+Access+Technology%2C+Atcherson+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f1d16f9c47edebd73a3e79172301fe7471ef21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,241,209,111,156,71,237,235,215,58,62,121,23,35,1,254,116,113,239,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
