These processes may interact with each other and may lead to self-organized structures, fluctuations, instabilities, and evolutionary systems. Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics, 3rd edition emphasizes the unifying role of thermodynamics in analyzing the natural phenomena. This third edition updates and expands on the first and second editions by focusing on the general balance equations for coupled processes of physical, chemical, and biological systems. The new edition contains a new chapter on stochastic approaches to include the statistical thermodynamics, mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics, fluctuation theory, information theory, and modeling the coupled biochemical systems in thermodynamic analysis. This new addition also comes with more examples and practice problems. It is a useful text for seniors and graduate students from diverse engineering and science programs to analyze some nonequilibrium, coupled, evolutionary, stochastic, and dissipative processes. It highlights fundamentals of equilibrium thermodynamics, transport processes and chemical reactions. It expands the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and its use in coupled transport processes and chemical reactions in physical, chemical, and biological systems. It presents a unified analysis for transport and rate processes in various time and space scales. It discusses stochastic approaches in thermodynamic analysis including fluctuation and information theories. It has 198 fully solved examples and 287 practice problems.\n\nProduct Description\nReview\n&quot;This third edition updates and expands on the first and second editions by focusing on the general balance equations for coupled processes of physical, chemical, and biological systems.

He earned an 'Advanced Chemical Engineering' diploma from the UMIST, University of Manchester, UK in 1977, and a PhD degree in chemical engineering from the University of Birmingham, UK in 1981. He joined the faculty of the ukurova University in Adana, Turkey as assistant professor, and promoted to associate professor in 1986. In 1993, he joined the faculty of the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran Saudi Arabia where he was promoted to full professor in 2000. He carried out research and scholarly work at the University of Delaware between 1999 and 2001. He worked at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg as a visiting Professor between 2002 and 2006. Currently, he is on the faculty of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Dr. Demirel has accumulated teaching and research experience over the years in diverse fields of engineering. He is the associate editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Thermodynamics and member of editorial board of International Journal of Exergy. Dr. Demirel authored and co-authored three books, two book chapters, and 120 research papers. The first edition of Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics was published in 2002. After it was expanded to a graduate textbook, the second edition was published in 2007. His new book titled &quot;Energy: Production, Conversion, Storage, Conservation, and Coupling is in press. He has obtained several awards and scholarships, and presented invited seminars. \n\nPublisher: Elsevier Science Ltd; 3rd Revised edition edition (30 January 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0444595570\nISBN-13: 978-0444595577","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3082d13effbceba6a774b04d5c48398a8ebd878e","amp;dn":"%5BYasar+Demirel%5DNonequilibrium+Thermodynamics+Transport+and+Rate+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3082d13effbceba6a774b04d5c48398a8ebd878e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,130,209,62,255,188,235,166,167,116,176,77,92,72,57,138,142,189,135,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
