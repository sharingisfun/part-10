Through quotations from the original sources and through the word pictures to which these give rise, the book aims at recreating, as far as is possible, the daily lives and experiences of a people who for a time became the supreme political and military power in the ancient Near East.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ead2836f700224b280acde084aa8b489120f0ba","amp;dn":"Life+and+Society+in+the+Hittite+World+%28Antic+History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ead2836f700224b280acde084aa8b489120f0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,173,40,54,247,0,34,75,40,10,205,224,132,170,139,72,145,32,240,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
