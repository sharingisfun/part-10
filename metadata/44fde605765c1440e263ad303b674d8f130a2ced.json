He was an important composer in the history of the group, writing such classic songs as 'Another Piece of Meat' and 'Falling in Love,' and the second single from the album Ã¢â‚¬ËœSavage Amusement,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ 'Passion Rules The Game.' Additionally, Herman penned the lyrics for some of the most classic songs of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire history, including 'Rock You Like a Hurricane,' 'Make It Real,' 'Dynamite,' 'Blackout,' 'Arizona,' 'Bad Boys Running Wild,' 'Don't Stop At the Top,' and 'Tease Me Please Me,' among countless others.\n\nAnother standout song that Herman penned was the beautiful ballad, &quot;I'll Say Goodbye,&quot; which was recorded with Don Dokken on vocals. Unfortunately, what would have surely been a worldwide hit for the Scorpions managed to slip through the cracks, as it was never recorded by the group. In 1982, Herman released his first solo album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœNip in the BudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (which he re-recorded as 'Herman ze German &amp; Friends' with the help of friends/members of Dokken, Great White, Ratt, etc.).\n\nTo this day, Herman remains the only member of the Scorpions to have released a solo project while still a full member of the band. However, by 1995, Rarebell decided to exit the Scorpions - leaving behind such lofty accomplishments as over 70 gold and 30 platinum records (in addition to countless other awards and prizes). Subsequently, with the contribution of Prince Albert of Monaco, he created Monaco Records. Herman has also participated in the Drum Legends project with his friend Pete York (ex-Spencer Davis Group) and jazz drummer Charly Antolini, and has released a live CD &amp; DVD.\n\nAnd on August 3, 2006, Herman joined the Scorpions onstage at the Wacken Festival as a special guest along with Ulrich Roth and Michael Schenker. Come 2010 Herman was ready to rock once more, as he returned with his latest solo album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœTake It As it ComesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (released via Dark Star Records), and its kick-ass lead-off single, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLet Me Rock You.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nIn 2012 Herman toured with Michael Schenker on the Japanese and European dates of his Temple of Rock tour, alongside another former member of The Scorpions, Francis Buchholz .Get ready to be pounded into submission once more by one of rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest drummers...Herman ze German Rarebell!\n\n\nHÃÂµrmÃÂ°n RÃÂ°rÃÂµbÃÂµll At MySpace\nimage\n\n\n\n\n2014 Herman's Scorpions Songs\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
