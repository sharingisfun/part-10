Finding out that an American Christian band had already taken that moniker, the shift was soon made to InMe, just in time to score a deal with label MFN in 2001. Eventually the band released its debut Ã¢â‚¬â€ Overgrown Eden Ã¢â‚¬â€ in 2003, which was bolstered by a series of moderate hit singles. Although InMe were riding a fairly sizable wave of popularity, they were dealt an irritating blow in 2004 when their label fell apart. Luckily for InMe, V2 was there, not only to sign them, but also to offer them a deal that allowed them space for their own label, Pandora's Box Records. A sophomore full-length was quickly issued in 2005. Entitled White Butterfly, it hit stores in two forms: one standard and another with a pair of bonus tracks. The following year saw the release of a live CD and DVD, both entitled Caught: White Butterfly. Although a few roster changes plagued the band, InMe soldiered on, and in 2007 released their third album, Daydream Anonymous. The rest of that year Ã¢â‚¬â€ and 2008 Ã¢â‚¬â€ would be spent recording new tracks, which eventually saw daylight as album number four, Herald Moth, planned for a 2009 release.\n\n\n\n**Here it is! If you are an InMe fan, you know how hard it is to get their albums online. I collected these from various downloads and they are pretty good quality. All are pretty high quality (above 200kbps). I think White Butterfly has 1 or 2 tracks missing but it will do. Hopefully I can buy their albums soon. This is a great band and hope everyone likes this torrent!** Bit  rates vary.\n\n\n\n    \nOvergrown Eden (2003) \n    \nWhite Butterfly (2005) \n    \nDaydream Anonymous (2007) \n    \nHerald Moth (2009)\n    \nThe Pride (2012)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e65297e47e4736c71acacfff0775bb9e36dff81","amp;dn":"InMe+Discography+--+5+Studio+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e65297e47e4736c71acacfff0775bb9e36dff81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,101,41,126,71,228,115,108,113,172,172,255,240,119,91,185,227,109,255,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
