He was one of the foremost members of the Acmeist school of poets.  He was arrested by Joseph Stalin's government during the repression of the 1930s and sent into internal exile with his wife Nadezhda.  Given a reprieve of sorts, they moved to Voronezh in southwestern Russia.  In 1938 Mandelstam was arrested again and sentenced to a camp in Siberia.  He died that year at a transit camp.\n\nMandelstam's own grim prophecy was thus fulfilled: &quot;Only in Russia is poetry respected; it gets people killed.  Is there anywhere else where poetry is so common a motive for murder?&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB and MOBI formats:\n\n* SELECTED ESSAYS (University of Texas Press, 1977).  Translated by Sidney Monas.\n\n* SELECTED POEMS (Penguin Classics, 1991).  Selected and translated by James Greene, with Forewords by Nadezhda Mandelstam and Donald Davie.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
