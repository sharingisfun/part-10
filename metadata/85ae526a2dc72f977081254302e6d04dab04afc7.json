Trans-Eurasian exchanges of goods, people and ideas were encouraged on a large scale under the auspices of the Pax Mongolica. With the fascination of portable objects brought from China and Central Asia, a distinctive, hitherto unknown style&amp; mdash;Islamic chinoiserie&amp; mdash;was born in the art of Iran. Highly illustrated, Islamic Chinoiserie offers a fascinating glimpse into the artistic interaction between Iran and China under the Mongols. By using rich visual materials from various media of decorative and pictorial arts&amp; mdash;textiles, ceramics, metalwork and manuscript painting&amp; mdash;the book illustrates the process of adoption and adaptation of Chinese themes in the art of Mongol-ruled Iran in a visually compelling way. The observation of this unique artistic phenomenon serves to promote the understanding of the artistic diversity of Islamic art in the Middle Ages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85ae526a2dc72f977081254302e6d04dab04afc7","amp;dn":"Islamic+chinoiserie+-+The+Art+of+Mongol+Iran+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85ae526a2dc72f977081254302e6d04dab04afc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,174,82,106,45,199,47,151,112,129,37,67,2,230,208,77,171,4,175,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
