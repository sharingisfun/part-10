A Pile of Rock: Live should fix that. Recorded live at the Central CafÃƒÂ© in GÃƒÂ¤vle, Sweden, in October 1997, A Pile of Rock: Live is a rollicking blast of three-chord napalm ? and confirmation that, on a good night, the reclusive pub rock legend can be a supreme live entertainer. And make no mistake, this recording captures Edmunds on a good night. A very good night. Backed by Swedish rock traditionalists the Refreshments ? Mikael Finell (saxophone, acoustic guitar, backup vocals), Joakim Arnell (bass, backup vocals), and Niklas Aspholm (drums) ? pianist extraordinaire Geraint Watkins, and ex-Rockpile guitarist Billy Bremner, Edmunds straps on and tears the roof off. Musical highlights are many, including a swinging version of Mickey Jupp's &quot;Standing at the Crossroads&quot; (featured on Edmunds' criminally neglected 1994 release, Plugged In), a bluesy instrumental rendering of the Beatles' &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; and a string-abusing &quot;Sabre Dance.&quot; As good a performer as Edmunds is ? and he's in peak form here, both instrumentally and vocally ? the secret weapon is the personnel backing him up. The Refreshments are well-known in Sweden as a top-notch trad rock outfit, and they fit Edmunds' brand of classic, Chuck Berry-inspired rock &amp; roll to an absolute T. Throw pub rock giants Bremner and Watkins into the mix, and you have a serious rhythm machine ? a machine operating at scary efficiency on tracks like Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Stop Messin' Around,&quot; Dion's &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; Fats Domino's &quot;I'm Ready,&quot; and the Berry standards &quot;Sweet Little Rock 'n' Roller&quot; and &quot;Let It Rock.&quot; This is roots rock at its best: The band is tighter than a kettledrum, and when he chooses to come out front and solo, Edmunds throws off lightning riffs with an assuredness that's no doubt sent many a cocky hotshot back to the drawing board. Though it's arguably a little heavy on classic covers, and the liner notes don't include much performance information, A Pile of Rock: Live is the best representation of Dave Edmunds the live performer. With a better song selection and more energetic performances than either King Biscuit Flower Hour or I Hear You Rockin', it is the place to start for understanding the live essence of one of rock's last true believers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5272f6e6fa09f230a881026ada3c7942569a0a","amp;dn":"Dave+Edmunds+-+A+Pile+Of+Rock+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5272f6e6fa09f230a881026ada3c7942569a0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,82,114,246,230,250,9,242,48,168,129,2,106,218,60,121,66,86,154,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
