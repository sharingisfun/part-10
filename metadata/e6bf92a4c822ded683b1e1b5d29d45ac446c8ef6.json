The song was written by John Lennon and attributed to the Lennon and McCartney songwriting partnership. It was inspired by Lennon's memories of playing in the garden of &quot;Strawberry Field&quot;, a Salvation Army children's home near where he lived.\n\n&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; was recorded for possible inclusion on the (as yet untitled) album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), being the first song recorded for the sessions, but was instead released in February 1967 as a double A side single with Paul McCartney's &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; reached number eight in the United States, with numerous critics describing it as one of the group's best recordings. It is one of the defining works of the psychedelic rock genre and has been covered by many artists. The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP (though not on the British double EP package of the same name). The Strawberry Fields memorial in New York City's Central Park is named after the song.\n\nThe promotional film for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; was an early example of what later became known as a music video. It was filmed on 30 and 31 January 1967, in Knole Park in Sevenoaks. It was directed by Swedish television director Peter Goldman. Goldman was a friend of Klaus Voormann, who had recommended Peter to the group. The film featured reverse film effects, stop motion animation, jump-cuts from daytime to night-time, and the Beatles playing and later pouring paint over an upright piano. During the same visit to Knole Park, Goldman produced the promotional film for &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, the reverse side of the &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; single (during this same stay in Sevenoaks, John Lennon wandered into an antiques gallery and purchased the poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal that would inspire the song &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;). The promotional films for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; were selected by New York's MoMA as two of the most influential music videos of the late 1960s. Both were originally broadcast in the US on 25 February 1967, on the variety show The Hollywood Palace, with actor Van Johnson as host. The Ed Sullivan Show and other variety shows soon dropped their time constraints to allow for psychedelic music performances. A cartoon based on the song was the final episode produced for The Beatles animated television series.\n\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/bAGBlaAga&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/bAGBlaAga&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:04:10\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
