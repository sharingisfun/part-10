Farming Simulator 2013 is bigger and enriched with outstanding content and many new features, challenging you to take on the role of a modern day farmer.\n\nAnimal husbandry, crops, sales. It's up to you to manage and grow your own farm in a huge, totally new world. As you progress in your career and complete different missions, you'll control more than a hundred farming vehicles and machines faithfully recreated from the biggest names in the industry: Case IH, Deutz-Fahr, Lamborghini, Same, Horsch and newcomer Grimme.\n\nThis year, Farming Simulator is back with even more diverse crops (sugar beet and potatoes), new livestock (chicken and sheep) and new vehicles never seen before in a video game!\n\nFeatures:\n- Over 100 vehicles and tools\n- Over 20 licensed brands including Case IH, Deutz-Fahr, Lamborghini, Same, Horsch, Amazone and many more\n- Career mode with economic system, animal husbandry &amp; purchaseable fields\n- 3 animal types: chicken, sheep &amp; cows\n- Additional growth state: weathered/gone bad\n- Placeable buildings and objects\n- Virtual dynamic terrain\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd now, I bring you a ModPack which adds 24 new maps and 200+ other various mods (which include tractors, combines, sowers, ect.).\n\nNOTE: The modpack is quite large and includes some really detailed models so it might create some lag for older PCs. The first time you run the game after you've added all the new mods it will take some time to load, dont worry, it'll get there. Some maps load a bit longer so be patient.\nI ran into a bug which I believe is caused by my game it self (not the mods). The left side of my HUD and my PDA are gone. I'm not 100% sure what exactly causes this bug.\n\nWHERE TO PLACE/MOVE THE MODS:\n\nExtract the mods folder from the .rar folder and move it to\nC:Users[your user name]DocumentsMy GamesFarmingSimulator2013\nand overwrite the folder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afc29e60dfc4a89b9cb036d8b6b8611faddd2d9","amp;dn":"Farming+Simulator+2013+ModPack+v1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afc29e60dfc4a89b9cb036d8b6b8611faddd2d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,252,41,230,13,252,74,137,185,203,3,109,139,107,134,17,250,221,210,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
