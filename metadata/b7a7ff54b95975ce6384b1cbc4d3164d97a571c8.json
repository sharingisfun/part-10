Lay Your Burden Down (5:42)\n\nFlesh and Blood is a significant release, being SandiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sophomore studio album, released solely by her independent label Guardian Angels Records.\n\nThe highly anticipated new album radiates the raunchy blues rock bravado of the opening track Help Me, followed by the country-flavoured Leadbelly classic In The Pines. The album also features the strutting, clavinet-led Stormy Weather; and the emotionally compelling finale Lay Your Burden Down.\n\nThe album features an all-star ensemble led by Black Crowes Rich Robinson, drummer Steve Gorman and fellow Black Crowe and widely travelled session guitarist Audley Freed, respected Nashville stars Mike Webb (keys/Dobro) and James Haggerty (bass) complete the line-up with special guest performances from Rolling Stones collaborator, saxophonist Bobby Keys, and stunning duet with the legendary singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie on her 1992 classic The Big Ones Get Away.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sandi really stretched herself and made a bold new album,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reflects Rich Robinson, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Her songs are honest, vulnerable and very strong. Her vocal abilities are showcased really well, as is her guitar work, and harp playing. I think SandiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made a great record. It was a joy to work with her.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLegendary classic rock producer Kevin Shirley (Led Zeppelin, The Black Crowes, Joe Bonamassa) also mixed two tracks, Sun Comes Crashing Down and a duet with Buffy Sainte-Marie on the latterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic song, The Big Ones Get Away.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“SandiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing is fantastic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Shirley, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and her singing is wonderful. Sun Comes Crashing Down has all the right ingredients to be a hit.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe intriguingly titled I Love You Like A Lunatic, is based on her Ã¢â‚¬Å“life-changingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ love affair with superstar blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa. The couple have been together three years now, living and loving on and off the road. Sandi likens it to a modern-day Johnny Cash and June Carter fairy-tale. Ã¢â‚¬Å“My life just turned crazy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Sandi. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yet thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what everybody wants, that insane kind of love that utterly consumes you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSandi feels that Flesh and Blood is her coming of age album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All I ever want to do is write songs that connect with people,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Sandi. Ã¢â‚¬Å“With this album IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve finally found a place where I can make the very best music I can achieve. The people that only know me from Punk Rocker wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognise me on this album. But they are going to find out another side of me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a7ff54b95975ce6384b1cbc4d3164d97a571c8","amp;dn":"Sandi+Thom+-+Flesh+and+Blood+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC+%2F+WEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a7ff54b95975ce6384b1cbc4d3164d97a571c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,167,255,84,185,89,117,206,99,132,177,203,196,211,22,77,151,165,113,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
