With the exception of a brief period in the early '50s, he led a big band from 1935 until his death almost 50 years later, and the band continued to perform after he died. Basie's orchestra was characterized by a light, swinging rhythm section that he led from the piano, lively ensemble work, and generous soloing. Basie was not a composer like Duke Ellington or an important soloist like Benny Goodman. His instrument was his band, which was considered the epitome of swing and became broadly influential on jazz. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t98.81% CDDA &amp; 99.83% CDDA &amp; 99.06% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tDecca\nCatalog:\t\tGRD-3-611\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.Honeysuckle Rose\n02.Pennies From Heaven\n03.Swinging At The Daisy Chain\n04.Roseland Shuffle\n05.Exactly Like You\n06.Boo Hoo\n07.The Glory Of Love\n08.Boogie Woogie (I May Be Wrong)\n09.Smarty (You Know It All)\n10.One O'Clock Jump\n11.Listen My Children (And You Shall Hear)\n12.John's Idea\n13.Good Morning Blues (1st Take)\n14.Good Morning Blues (2nd Take)\n15.Our Love Was Meant To Be\n16.Time Out\n17.Topsy\n18.I Keep Remembering\n19.Out The Window\n20.Don't You Miss Your Baby\n21.Let Me Dream\n\nCD 2\n\n01.Georgianna\n02.Blues In The Dark\n03.Sent For You Yesterday\n04.Every Tub\n05.Now Will You Be Good\n06.Swingin' The Blues\n07.Mama Don't Want No Peas 'N' Rice 'N' Coconut Oil\n08.Blue And Sentimental\n09.Doggin' Around\n10.Stop Beatin' Round The Mulberry Bush (1st Take)\n11.Stop Beatin' Round The Mulberry Bush (2nd Take)\n12.London Bridge Is Falling Down\n13.Texas Shuffle\n14.Jumpin' At The Woodside\n15.How Long Blues\n16.The Dirty Dozens\n17.Hey Lawdy Mama\n18.The Fives\n19.Boogie Woogie\n20.Dark Rapture\n21.Shorty George\n22.The Blues I Like To Hear\n23.Do You Wanna Jump, Children\n24.Panassie Stomp\n\nCD 3\n\n01.My Heart Belongs To Daddy\n02.Sing For Your Supper\n03.Oh!
