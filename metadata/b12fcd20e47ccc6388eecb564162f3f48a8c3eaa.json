Each issue deals with a separate issue in life, ranging from being overshadowed by the work of his parents to the birth of his first child, and how precious each of these moments are in one's life.  Unfortunately, Bras never gets to enjoy those moments, as the series runs a gimmick that features Bras de Oliva Domingos dying at the end of each issue. \n \nMost commonly, Bras de Oliva Domingos is portrayed as a writer of some sort, mainly an obituarist but occasionally as an author of books.  From issue to issue, other characters that have shown up in previous issues will appear in the issue directly following it as some role in Bras' life.\n \nThe series is a 10-issue limited run.  A deluxe edition hardcover collection is expected in Spring 2011. &quot;\n\n-ComicVine\n\n\nSpecial thanks go out to all the scanners, and as always, support your writers: you like it, you buy it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b12fcd20e47ccc6388eecb564162f3f48a8c3eaa","amp;dn":"Daytripper+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b12fcd20e47ccc6388eecb564162f3f48a8c3eaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,47,205,32,228,124,204,99,136,238,203,86,65,98,243,244,138,140,62,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
