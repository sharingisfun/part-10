Band influences include: Impetigo, Autopsy, Repulsion, Grave, Entombed(old), Metallica(old), Slayer(old), the Misfits(old), Black Sabbath, Dark Angel, Overkill, and many other great classic metal bands of the past. The biggest influence of all, though, are cult and obscure horror/gore/cult-films from the 60ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s! Nothing beats a fun, cheesy drive-in movie made in 2 days in 1974, or an out of print VHS-era cheapo gore flick from 1983! The love for this stuff is obsessive and bordering on dangerous and scary at times. Everybody involved in the band suffers from an extreme bad case of brain rot and the demand for GORETITS is more than ever! Melt down horror DVDÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â¦shoot it into our veins, and watch the MADNESS begin! More monsters, more freaks, more cheese, more movies!!! FUCK FASHION, WE WANT BLOOD!\n\nBLOOD FREAK has 3 full-length albums out, all on horror/gore metal specialty label - Razorback Records. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sleaze MerchantsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ came out in 2003 and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live Fast, Die YoungÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ And Leave A Flesh-Eating Corpse!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ came out in 2006. The latest, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Multiplex MassacreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, came out in 2007.\n\nThere will be many more to come after that as this band is dedicated and addicted to creating crushing horror/gore worshipping METAL and nothing else!! Expect only the finest gore from BLOOD FREAK and get ready for a roller-coaster ride of true horror metal insanity!\n\nYear: 2003 - 2014\nCountry: United States, Portland\nGenre: Death Metal/Grindcore\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 192 - 320Kbps\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\nBlood Freak - 2003 - Sleaze Merchants\nBlood Freak - 2006 - Live Fast, Die YoungÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ And Leave A Flesh-Eating Corpse!\nBlood Freak - 2007 - Multiplex Massacre\nBlood Freak - 2011 - Mindscraper\nBlood Freak - 2014 - Squalor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:127dfd71d7c87e30acea46a7ca0e57ee74abd098","amp;dn":"Blood+Freak+-+Discography+%5BMetal%5D+%282003+-+2014%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"127dfd71d7c87e30acea46a7ca0e57ee74abd098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,125,253,113,215,200,126,48,172,234,70,167,202,14,87,238,116,171,208,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
