The story begins in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war and centers on Hamza, who is first seen having a heated conversation with his wife, who accuses him of self-centeredness for not actively helping to get her and their adolescent daughter to safety. Shortly thereafter, the wife and daughter leave the city. One day, Hamza encounters seven-year-old Adis and his mute nine-year-old brother Kerim. With no one left to care for them, they are seeking their aunt Aicha, who has disappeared. During their arduous journey, the three befriend a wounded dog and thus an unlikely family is formed amidst the death and devastation.
