In the Season 7 premiere, we pick up with the new couple well into BrennanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pregnancy. Still seeing the world from radically different perspectives, Booth and Brennan grapple with the issues surrounding the upcoming birth of their child--all while continuing to deal with a series of gruesome and baffling crimes. And this season brings more than a baby. Our team will also have to contend with a nefarious tech-savvy foe who uses his unparalleled skills to challenge Booth, Brennan and the squints to solve a string of murders designed to embarrass and humiliate them.\n_________________________________________________\n\n1\t&quot;The Memories in the Shallow Grave&quot;\n\n2\t&quot;The Hot Dog in the Competition&quot;\n\n3\t&quot;The Prince in the Plastic&quot;\n\n4\t&quot;The Male in the Mail&quot;\n\n5\t&quot;The Twist in the Twister&quot;\n\n6\t&quot;The Crack in the Code&quot;\n\n7\t&quot;The Prisoner in the Pipe&quot;\n\n8\t&quot;The Bump in the Road&quot;\n\n9\t&quot;The Don't in the Do&quot;\n\n10\t&quot;The Warrior in the Wuss&quot;\n\n11\t&quot;The Family in the Feud&quot;\n\n12\t&quot;The Suit on the Set&quot;\n\n13\t&quot;The Past in the Present&quot;\n\nAlso included is the pilot for &quot;Touch&quot; as this was also on the DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024c317b4d82b13cb1a4fa1be45a20772075b9e5","amp;dn":"Bones+Season+7+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024c317b4d82b13cb1a4fa1be45a20772075b9e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,76,49,123,77,130,177,60,177,164,250,27,228,90,32,119,32,117,185,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
