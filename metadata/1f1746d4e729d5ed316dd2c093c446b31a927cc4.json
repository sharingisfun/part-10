Offering a balanced and streamlined presentation, this edition has been updated throughout with new material and revised presentations. For the first time, this book is integrated with OWL, a powerful online learning system for chemistry that engages students and improves learning outcomes. \n\n    Revised Art and Graphics: To increase the pedagogical effectiveness of the art program and to help students better visualize chemical processes, the book's molecular art has been revised to allow for greater consistency in use of atomic color code and now includes more current PyMOL-based molecular graphics.\n    New End-of-Chapter Material: A new &quot;Things You Should Know&quot; study section has been added to the end-of-chapter material. In addition, new topical headers in the problem sets make it easier to assign problems that pertain to a particular topic.\n    New Coverage: New material has been added on the Ventor Institute's creation of synthetic life; new discussions of protein sectors and metamorphic proteins have been added to Chapter 6; and various free online protein databases have been incorporated throughout the book's narrative.\n    Revised and Updated Coverage: This edition features thoroughly updated coverage of human gene therapy in Chapter 12 and heavily revised coverage of DNA metabolism in Chapter 28.\n    vReorganized Material: Material on reduction potentials and free energy changes in redox reactions has been placed earlier in the book (moved from Chapter 20 to Chapter 3); the discussion of protein techniques was moved from an appendix to Chapter 5 into the chapter proper as an &quot;A Deeper Look&quot; box; and the DNA Sequencing boxed essay is now expanded and incorporated into the Chapter 11 text narrative.\n    Full Integration with OWL (Online Web Learning): For the first time, this book is fully integrated with OWL, a powerful online learning system for chemistry that engages students, assesses performance, and improves learning outcomes. OWL includes parameterized mastery homework assignments correlated to text sections that encourage students to practice multiple questions of the same type with different chemicals, wording, and numbers to ensure their mastery of the underlying chemical concepts. OWL also includes Student Self Assessments, an interactive customizable Cengage YouBook (OWL's multimedia e-book), and an optional Solutions Manual eBook.
