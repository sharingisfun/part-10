In 1996, it was selected by film director Quentin Tarantino for the first Quentin Tarantino Film Festival in Austin, Texas.\n\nFilm critic Danny Peary lists the film as one of his &quot;Must See&quot; Films in his Guide for the Film Fanatic (1986).\n\nThis nightmarish, surprisingly subversive thriller is one of the best and most memorable films to emerge from New World Pictures during their 1970's heyday.\n\nIt offers a grim, powerful critique of the American Dream, an idea best expressed in monologue about the country that Tommy Lee Jones delivers during the midsection of the film. Jackson County Jail also features strong performances from Yvette Mimieux as the beleaguered heroine, whose reactions are subtle but believable to the horrors she experiences, and Tommy Lee Jones, who suffuses the role of a seen-it-all con with an effortless charisma. Finally, the film's appeal is sealed by the direction of Michael Miller, who maintains a high level of quality in the performances throughout the film and carefully blends drama with action while sustaining an ever-building mood of tension. He also delivers a finale that is as emotionally shattering as it is exciting. In short, Jackson County Jail is one of the lesser-known classics of the drive-in era and well worth the time for cult movie fans.\n\n&quot;If you are who you say you are,&quot; the small-town sheriff tells the young woman, &quot;you won't have any trouble.&quot; The young woman (Yvette Mimieux) is Dinah Hunter, who has just thrown over her job with a Los Angeles advertising agency, as well as her lover of two years, and has been driving back to New York. However, all her identificationÃ¢â‚¬â€along with her money and her carÃ¢â‚¬â€have been stolen by a pair of pill-popping hitchhikers she picked up earlier in the day, thinking she was doing a good deed.\n\nWhen the hitchhikers pulled a gun on her and threw her out of the car somewhere in southern Arizona, they dropped Dinah into a nightmare land from which she probably will never emerge. &quot;If you are who you say you are . . .&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€the line becomes the theme of a fine, tough little melodrama called &quot;Jackson County Jail,&quot; which opened yesterday at the Embassy 49th Street and other theaters in New York.\n\nIt isn't the film's very dismal view of Bicentennial America that gives &quot;Jackson County Jail&quot; its vigor. The film lays on the ironies and hypocrisies so heavily that it sometimes seems to be the work of especially snobbish film makers, people who think that everything between Los Angeles and New York is the boondocks.\n\n&quot;Jackson County Jail&quot; is film making of relentless energy and harrowing excitement that recall the agitprop melodramas of the 30's. It's not exactly in a class with Lang's &quot;You Only Live Once,&quot; but it possesses the kind of fury that can breathe life into a melodrama even when the point of view is simple-minded.\n\nThe film was directed by Michael Miller and written by Donald Stewart, neither of whom I'd heard of before. Roger Corman, sometimes known as the king of the B's, was the executive producer, and it has the drive, movement and economy of narrative that are the marks of Corman films, good and bad.\n\n&quot;Jackson County Jail&quot; shows how someone as self-aware, self-assured and secure as its middle-class heroine can, literally overnight, find herself in a landscape where nothing she has ever known or believed still holds.\n\nUnable to produce identification for the sheriff, Dinah is put into the county lockup for the night. She is raped by the jailer, whom she murders in self-defense, and the next mornnng is out on the road, sharing a get-away car with a young man who is an accused murderer and admitted truck hijacker.\n\nIt's preposterous, and the movie works within its own terms, though one shouldn't overanalyze it for the wrong (political) reasons.\n\nMr. Miller and Mr. Stewart picture a land of unremitting evil and brutality where everyone is corrupt, from the wise-cracking waitress, who attempts to shortchange Dinah the first morning out, to the policeman-rapist. The only good guy is the truck hijacker who admits to thieving because he likes it and who will rationalize his life only to the extent of saying, &quot;The whole country is a rip-off.&quot;\n\nThe film manages to stay clear of sentimentality of the conventional sort, though when the hijacker, nicely played by Tommy Lee Jones, says with a shrug just before the final shoot-out, &quot;I was born dead anyway,&quot; it's dealing in its own sort of sentimentality.\n\nMiss Mimieux is excellent in a role that subjects her to as many bruises, humiliations and indignities as she might get in the boxing ring. All of the performances are fine and to the point. I hesitate to say too much, thus to oversell a movie that is best come upon without great expectations. I would suspect that Mr. Miller and Mr. Stewart are new film makers to watch.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 816mb\nDuration.... 01:23:43\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 1111kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 245kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 32KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eba8fd693cfca088a5f8e70a6fb64100b815381","amp;dn":"Jackson+County+Jail+1976+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eba8fd693cfca088a5f8e70a6fb64100b815381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,186,143,214,147,207,202,8,138,95,142,112,166,251,100,16,11,129,83,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
