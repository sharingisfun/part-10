From deconstruction methods and salvaging tips to plotting efficient cutting plans and devising creative new uses for everyday items, it is packed with clever ways to obtain low-cost materials (and reduce landfilling in the process).\n\nThis book contains the answer to a question most of us have wondered about at some point: Is that pile of used maple flooring I saw on Craigslist worth taking? From plywood to hardwood flooring, to windows, doors, carpeting and more, salvaging building materials can save you thousands of dollars (and is about as green as you can get). This book is a hands-on, do-it-yourselfer's guide that shows you how to identify materials that can be salvaged efficiently and then gives you step-by-step instructions on how to go about doing it. Plus, it provides over one dozen complete plans featuring clever ideas for putting salvaged materials to good use as useful home furnishings.\n\n\nBy Chris Peterson\nPublished by Creative Publishing in 2011\nTags: nonfiction, architecture, design, carpentry, decor\nEPUB, Retail, 144 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:049ab12772e7c88432cdb6b2d5f80fef41b34546","amp;dn":"Building+with+Secondhand+Stuff+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"049ab12772e7c88432cdb6b2d5f80fef41b34546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,154,177,39,114,231,200,132,50,205,182,178,213,248,15,239,65,179,69,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
