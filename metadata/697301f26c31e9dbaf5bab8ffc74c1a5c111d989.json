Taking the heavy, distorted electric blues of Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, and Cream to an extreme, Zeppelin created a majestic, powerful brand of guitar rock constructed around simple, memorable riffs and lumbering rhythms. But the key to the group's attack was subtlety: it wasn't just an onslaught of guitar noise, it was shaded and textured, filled with alternating dynamics and tempos. As Led Zeppelin proves, the group was capable of such multi-layered music from the start. Although the extended psychedelic blues of &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; &quot;You Shook Me,&quot; and &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; often gather the most attention, the remainder of the album is a better indication of what would come later. &quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot; shifts from folky verses to pummeling choruses; &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot; and &quot;How Many More Times&quot; have groovy, bluesy shuffles; &quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot; is an anthemic hard rocker; &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot; is pure English folk; and &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; is a frenzied rocker with a nearly punkish attack. Although the album isn't as varied as some of their later efforts, it nevertheless marked a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:697301f26c31e9dbaf5bab8ffc74c1a5c111d989","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Led+Zeppelin+%282014%29+Deluxe+Edition+%5BIMAGE+SCANS%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"697301f26c31e9dbaf5bab8ffc74c1a5c111d989","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,115,1,242,108,49,233,219,175,91,171,143,252,116,193,165,193,17,217,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
