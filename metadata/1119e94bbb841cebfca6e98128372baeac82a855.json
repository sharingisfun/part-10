This 1974 session was a rarity, an opportunity for Basie to be featured in a trio setting (with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Louie Bellson), during which he provides enough variety to hold one's interest and enough technique to lead many to reassess his piano skills. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nRay Brown's bass just DOMINATES this set, and Basie never sounded better on the piano or organ then in this trio setting. Bellson is great too, swinging with brushes and cymbals. But anyone even remotely a fan of Ray Brown should snap this up right now! ~ Luke\n\nHey, to be able to listen to Count Basie without the big band sound is a joy. This is a great CD. One that ought to be in every jazz listener's collection.
