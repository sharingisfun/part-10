It provides ready-to-implement solutions to common programming and database administration tasks. Learn to create databases, insert and update data, generate reports, secure your data, and more. Tasks and their solutions are broken down into a problem/solution format that is quick and easy to read so that you can get the job done fast when the pressure is on. \n\n\nSolutions in this book are divided into chapters by problem domain. Each chapter is a collection of solutions around a single facet of the language such as writing queries, developing triggers, and applying aggregate functions. Each solution is presented code-first, giving you a working code example to copy from and implement immediately in your own environment. Following each example is an in-depth description of how and why the given solution works. Tradeoffs and alternative approaches are also discussed. \n\n\nBook Details :\n    * Format : PDF\n    * Paperback: 808 pages\n    * Publisher: Apress \n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1430242000    \n    * ISBN-13: 9781430242000    \n    * File Size:3.76 MB\n\n\nNote: If You Have Problem With Any Of my Torrents Register To My Site And PM Me About Your  Problem: freebookdownloader.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0299dcf932959783a27e6329e1d0872a06362237","amp;dn":"SQL+Server+2012+T-SQL+Recipes+A+Problem-Solution+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0299dcf932959783a27e6329e1d0872a06362237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,153,220,249,50,149,151,131,162,126,99,41,225,208,135,42,6,54,34,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
