He writes human-interest pieces for British and American papers, avoiding the investigative journalism that could get him deported. But as war approaches, he faces the prospect of having to leave his son and his longtime girlfriend.\nThen, an acquaintance from his communist days approaches him to do some work for the Soviets. Russell is reluctant but ultimately unable to resist. He becomes involved in other dangerous activities, helping a Jewish family and an idealistic American reporter. When the British and the Nazis notice his involvement with the Soviets, Russell is dragged into the world of warring intelligence services.\n\nSilesian Station\n\n\n\nSummer, 1939. British journalist John Russell has just been granted American citizenship in exchange for agreeing to work for American intelligence when his girlfriend Effi is arrested by the Gestapo. Russell hoped his new nationality would let him safely stay in Berlin with Effi and his son, but now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being blackmailed. To free Effi, he must agree to work for the Nazis. They know he has Soviet connections and want him to pass them false intelligence. Russell consents, but secretly offers his services to the Soviets insteadÃ¢â‚¬â€not for anything too dangerous, though, and only if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll sneak him and Effi out of Germany if necessary. \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good plan, but soon things become complicated. A Jewish girl has vanished, and Russell feels compelled to search for her. A woman from his past, a communist, reappears, insisting he help her reconnect with the Soviets, who turn out to demand more than Russell hoped. Meanwhile, Europe lurches toward war, and he must follow the latest storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€to places where American espionage assignments await him.\n\nStettin Station\n\n\n\nIn the fall of 1941, Anglo-American journalist John Russell is still living in Berlin, tied to the increasingly alien city by his love for two Berliners: his fourteen-year-old son, Paul, and his longtime girlfriend, Effi. Forced to work for both German and American Intelligence, he's searching for a way out of Germany. Can he escape and take Effi with him?\n\nPotsdam Station\n\n\n\nIn April 1945, HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Reich is on the verge of extinction. Assaulted by Allied bombs and Soviet shells, ruled by Nazis with nothing to lose, Berlin has become the most dangerous place on earth.\n\nJohn RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son Paul is stationed on the Eastern Front with the German Army, awaiting the SovietsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ final onslaught. In Berlin, RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girlfriend Effi has been living in disguise, helping fugitives to escape from Germany. With a Jewish orphan to care for, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to outlast the Nazis. \n\nRussell hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard from either of them since fleeing Germany in 1941. He is desperate to find out if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re alive and to protect them from the advancing Red Army. He flies to Moscow, seeking permission to enter Berlin with the Red Army as a journalist, but when the SovietÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrest him as a spy, things look bleakÃ¢â‚¬â€until they find a use for him that has him parachuting into Berlin behind German lines.\n\nLehrter Station\n\n\n\nParis, November 1945. John Russell is walking home along the banks of the Seine on a cold and misty evening when Soviet agent Yevgeny Shchepkin falls into step alongside him. Shchepkin tells Russell that the American intelligence will soon be asking him to undertake some low grade espionage on their behalfÃ¢â‚¬â€assessing the strains between different sections of the German Communist PartyÃ¢â‚¬â€and that ShchepkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own bosses in Moscow want him to accept the task and pass his findings on to them. He adds that refusal will put RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s livelihood and life at risk, but that once he has accepted it, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find himself even further entangled in the Soviet net. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lose-lose situation.\n\nShchepkin admits that his own survival now depends on his ability to utilize Russell. The only way out for the two of them is to make a deal with the Americans. If they can come up with something the Americans want or need badly enough, then perhaps Russell will be forgiven for handing German atomic secrets over to Moscow and Shchepkin might be offered the sort of sanctuary that also safeguards the lives of his wife and daughter in Moscow. Every decision Russell makes now is a dangerous one.\n\n\nMasaryk Station\n\n\n\nBerlin, 1948. Still occupied by the four Allied powers and largely in ruins, the city has become the cockpit of a new Cold War. The legacies of the war have become entangled in the new Soviet-American conflict, creating a world of bizarre and fleeting loyaltiesÃ¢â‚¬â€a paradise for spies. As spring unfolds, a Western withdrawal looks increasingly likely. BerlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s German inhabitants live in fear of the Soviet forces who occupy half the city, and whose legacy of violence has ripped apart many families.\n\nJohn Russell works for both Stalin's NKVD and the newly created CIA, trying his best to cut himself loose from both before his double-agency is discovered by either. As tensions between the great powers escalate, each passing day makes RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position more treacherous. He and his Soviet liaison, Shchepkin, seek out one final operationÃ¢â‚¬â€one piece of intelligence so damning it could silence the wrath of one nation and solicit the protection of the other. It will be the most dangerous task Russell has ever taken on, but one way or the other, it will be his last.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f2cd5a4b04180ea6b82375535cbcf6c11669f60","amp;dn":"John+Russell+Series+1-6+by+David+Downing+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f2cd5a4b04180ea6b82375535cbcf6c11669f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,44,213,164,176,65,128,234,107,130,55,85,53,203,207,108,17,102,159,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
