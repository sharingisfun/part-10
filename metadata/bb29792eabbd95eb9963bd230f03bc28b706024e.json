Originally, all 4 episodes had been lost and reconstructions were made. But in 2011 episode 3 was found. It was released in either 2012 or 2013. I can not find a definitive date for its actual release. This torrent includes all 4 reconstructions as well as the found Episode 3, 'Air Lock.'\n\nI apologize. I should have included it in the original season 3 torrent. But I was not aware of the found episode until a true 'Whovian' filled me in.\n\nBetter late than never.\n\n1.  Galaxy 4 - Four Episodes\n    All four reconstructed episodes AND the 'found' episode 3 as well.\n\n    Synopsis: Two ships have crashed after a space battle, but the planet they\n    have landed on is about to be destroyed. The beautiful female Drahvins seem\n    friendly, but in fact it is the ugly Rills that are more tolerant and\n    forgiving.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb29792eabbd95eb9963bd230f03bc28b706024e","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Season+3+-+%281965-66%29+-+Galaxy+4+Recon+-+%284+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb29792eabbd95eb9963bd230f03bc28b706024e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,41,121,46,171,189,149,235,153,99,189,35,15,3,188,40,183,6,2,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
