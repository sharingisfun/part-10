On their debut album, The Sickness, the band\ncombines an over-the-top metal groove appealing to the underground with radio-friendly melodic hooks that grab hold of mainstream rock fans. Disturbed is that rare hard group with street credibility and musical chops. Now that is truly disturbing. Certified Multi-Platinum (2 times) by the RIAA.
