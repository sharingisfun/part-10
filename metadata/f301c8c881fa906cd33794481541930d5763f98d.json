The band is the brainchild of singer-songwriter Jamie Stewart, who has been its only constant member since its inception. His current bandmates are cousin, Caralee McElroy, percussionist Ches Smith, and bassist Devin Hoff. Xiu Xiu are also, on occasion, joined by Cory McCulloch, who has also produced several of their albums. Past members include Lauren Andrews, Yvonne Chen, Sam Mickens and Jherek Bischoff. Some, including McCulloch, have played in previous bands with Stewart, notably Ten in the Swear Jar and IBOPA. The band&amp;#039;s name is taken from the 1998 Chinese film Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl.\n\nXiu Xiu&amp;#039;s music draws heavily from several disparate genres including punk, noise rock, ambient noise, modern classical, and folk. The majority of lyrics deal with morose topics such as suicide, AIDS, war, and taboo experiences. Musically, the band will often blend cacophonous percussion with lush hooks and diverging lyrical styles, influenced by bands of the UK post-punk scene such as The Cure and Joy Division.&quot; (Wikipedia)\n\n\n1  \t   \tClover (5:11)\n2 \t  \tMuppet Face (3:23)\n3 \t  \tMouse Toy (3:28)\n4 \t  \tPox (4:08)\n5 \t  \tBaby Captain (3:41)\n6 \t  \tSaturn (3:20)\n7 \t  \tRose Of Sharon (5:04)\n8 \t  \tAle (5:39)\n9 \t  \tBog People (3:19)\n10 \t  \tDangerous You Shouldn&amp;#039;t Be Here (3:51)\n11 \t  \tYellow Raspberry (3:07)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f301c8c881fa906cd33794481541930d5763f98d","amp;dn":"Xiu+Xiu+-+2005+-+La+For%C3%AAt+%28mp3%2F160%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f301c8c881fa906cd33794481541930d5763f98d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,1,200,200,129,250,144,108,211,55,148,72,21,65,147,13,87,99,249,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
