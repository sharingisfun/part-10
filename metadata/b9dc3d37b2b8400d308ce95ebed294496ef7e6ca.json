As dusk deepens to night, he begins the tale that has brought them to this fateful meeting.Changez is living an immigrants dream of America. At the top of his class at Princeton, he is snapped up by Underwood Samson, an elite firm that specializes in the valuation of companies ripe for acquisition. He thrives on the energy of New York. But in the wake of 9/11, he finds his position in his adopted city suddenly overturned. And Changezs own identity is in seismic shift as well, unearthing allegiances more fundamental than money, power, and perhaps even love.\n\nPublisher: BBC Audiobooks America; Unabridged edition (April 3, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1602831777\nISBN-13: 978-1602831773\n\n Satya Bhabha (Narrator)\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
