Dream symbolism and interpretation is examined in historical, cultural, and psychological detail, while a dictionaryÃ¢â‚¬â€updated with 1,000 symbols and explanationsÃ¢â‚¬â€offers further insights. Dreaming about teeth, for instance, can indicate control issues, and dreaming of a zoo can indicate that the dreamer needs to tidy up some situation. Examining these concepts and more, this is the ultimate dreamer's companion.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 479 pages\nPublisher: Visible Ink Press; Second Edition, (May 1, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 157859216X\nISBN-13: 978-1578592166\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47bfce3417efa118ebac335d348bbd7ffaf97f96","amp;dn":"The+Dream+Encyclopedia+%282009%29+by+James+R.+Lewis+%5BHxH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47bfce3417efa118ebac335d348bbd7ffaf97f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,191,206,52,23,239,161,24,235,172,51,93,52,139,189,127,250,249,127,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
