Highlighting the evolutionary functions of various physiological traits, Morris's study explores the various forms of enhancement and constraint that human societies have developed in the quest for the perfect female form. This is very much vintage Desmond Morris, delivered in his trademark voice: direct, clear, focused, and communicating what is often complex detail in simple language. In THE NAKED WOMAN, Desmond builds on his unrivalled experience as an observer of the human animal while tackling one of his most fascinating and challenging subjects to date.\n\nISBN 0312338538 \nISBN 13: 9780312338534","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1f8fec7d39670187f6f63fcf12e962719f529cc","amp;dn":"Desmond+Morris+-+2005+-+The+Naked+Woman+%28276p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1f8fec7d39670187f6f63fcf12e962719f529cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,248,254,199,211,150,112,24,127,111,99,252,241,46,150,39,25,245,41,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
