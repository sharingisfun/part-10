In this course, photojournalist Paul Taggart explores the unique challenges of documenting family as he shoots a photo essay about his brother, an amateur astronomer, avid ham radio operator, off-roading enthusiast, and dedicated father in rural Oklahoma.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962359400eb24f6347fbadbc7522ff821c79c512","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Shooting+a+Photo+Essay%3A+Telling+a+Family+Story+with+Paul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962359400eb24f6347fbadbc7522ff821c79c512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,35,89,64,14,178,79,99,71,251,173,188,117,34,255,130,28,121,197,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
