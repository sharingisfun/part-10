So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a wish come true when JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newly found thunder egg hatches, and a helpless, tiny but very loud baby dragon pops out. Soon the two kids are at the dragonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beck-and-call, trying to figure out what to feed her.\n\nAn Internet search leads them to the library, which leads them back to the Internet, where they find a very strange Web site called Ã¢â‚¬Å“foundadragon.org.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It is here that the cousins discover that the dragonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hatching has designated them Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dragon KeepersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that not only do they have to feed her, but they have to keep her safe from the villainous Saint George who has kept himself alive over centuries by drinking dragonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ blood.\n\n\n\nBook 2: The Dragon in the Driveway\nThe Dragon Keepers have a new mission!\n\nIt's been raining for days, and dragon keepers Jesse and Daisy have been stuck inside with their dragon, Emmy. As soon as the rain stops, they are out of the house in a flash. First on their list of things to do? To find out what the villainous Dr. St. GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â€a dragon slayer in disguiseÃ¢â‚¬â€is up to. \n\nBut Dr. St. George isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t in his office at the college, and all of his stuff is gone! Jesse, Daisy, and Emmy quickly discover St. GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest evil plan: to take over the forest and find the magic golden ax that is buried there. To make matters worse, he has also enslaved the mythical beings that are returning to Goldmine City. Can the two dragon keepers and their dragon free the hobgoblins and dryads under St. GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power and return the forest to right?\n\n\n\nBook 3: The Dragon in the Library\nDragon keepers Jesse and Daisy need help! \n\nEmmy, their rapidly growing dragon, has become a real grouch, saying she's missing &quot;something,&quot; and the cousins don't have a clue what that something is. Jesse and Daisy go online to ask Professor Andersson, their favorite dragon expert, for help and end up seeing him being kidnapped!\n\nThe kidnapper is none other than Sadie Huffington, the girlfriend of their enemy, St. George the Dragon Slayer. She has hatched a wicked scheme to use the professor to both find St. George and capture Emmy. Now the dragon keepers and their dragon must storm Sadie's castle and rescue the professor from the witch and her pack of vicious dog-men!\n\nIn this third fantasy book in the Dragon Keepers series, Kate Klimo introduces readers to a magical library filled with shelf elves and reveals the secrets of the gigantic red book that Jesse and Daisy discovered in The Dragon in the Sock Drawer. She keeps the action and adventure flying while bringing both heart and imagination to this tale of two kids and a dragon, growing up together.\n\nThe Dragon Keepers series is perfect for kids who crave books about dragons and magic but are caught betwixt and betweenÃ¢â‚¬â€too old for Magic Tree House and not yet ready for Eragon and the Inheritance cycle.\n\n\n\nBook 4: The Dragon in the Volcano\nWhat do you do when your dragon becomes a 'tween? Worry! And that's exactly what Dragon Keepers Jesse and Daisy do when their dragon, Emmy, outgrows their garage and starts disappearing. Luckily, when she really disappears, she also leaves them a trail of socks, which leads them headlong into a . . . volcano? Yep! And it only gets crazier from there! In this fourth title, author Kate Klimo introduces readers to a whole new worldÃ¢â‚¬â€the Fiery Realm, where dragons can be felled by a squirt of water and fire fairies have started mysteriously disappearing. As always, readers get a full dose of action and imagination in this expanding tale of two kids and a dragon, growing up together. A great boy-girl adventure for readers of How to Train Your Dragon!\n\n\n\nBook 5: The Dragon in the Sea\nThis excellent series is solidly middle grade, accessible, and adventure-filled. In The Dragon in the Sea, Dragon Keepers Jesse and Daisy, help their dragon, Emmy, as she tries to protect an egg which holds her baby brother. Their adventures take them into the Watery Realms, a world filled with mer-people, selkies, and water zombies. Magic, mayhem, and an unusual cast of charaters make the reading fun, and the wonderful relationship between the dragon keeper cousins and their dragon add both depth and dimension.\n\nGenre: Childrens | Adventure | Fantasy | Humor | Animals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c31f37271b82613f08e6547493d4a5cfe7279eb","amp;dn":"Dragon+Keepers+series+-+Kate+Klimo+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c31f37271b82613f08e6547493d4a5cfe7279eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,49,243,114,113,184,38,19,240,142,101,71,73,61,74,92,254,114,121,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
