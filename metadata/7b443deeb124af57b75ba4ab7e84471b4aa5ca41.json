This allowed me to spend some time yesterday on something else...\n\nOne of the things that were highly requested as extras for &quot;Another Version Of The Truth&quot; were those incredible on-stage Australian tour videos posted on nin.com. Since we want AVOTT to stick to the Lights In The Sky tour, I decided to create a little DVD for all of you guys out there that would like to watch that amazing footage on your TVs but just don't know how to make your own DVDs.\n\nNIN : Australia 2009 is a standard definition DVD that fits on single layer discs. Its content was slightly edited so that all the songs flow continuously as one big performance.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 - 1,000,000 - Live In Sydney\n2 - Letting You - Live In Brisbane\n3 - Wish - Live in Adelaide\n\n4 - Power Outage - Sydney\n\n5 - Burn - Live In Melbourne\n6 - The Fragile - Live In Adelaide\n7 - Wish - Live In Perth\n\nI also threw in a few extras for your viewing pleasure :\n\nEurope 2007\n1 - Me I'm Not\n2 - The Great Destroyer\n\nAnother Version Of The Truth Trailer\n\n-------------------\n\nThis NTSC release is available NOW as a VIDEO_TS folder that can be burned to DVD by most DVD burning programs - I suggest Nero if you are on PC, Toast if on a Mac and K3b if on Linux. Make sure you select the DVD Video_Ts option when burning, otherwise it may not work.\n\nEnjoy !\n\n- Ash512, Head Editor, thisoneisonus.org\n\n-------------------\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\nYou might experience trouble with Letterboxing when watching the DVD if your have a regular 4:3 (Square shaped rather than Widescreen) television. The DVD contains information that should tell your player to automatically respect the video's original screen ratio by adding black bars. If the image appears to be squished and covers the whole screen, it means your DVD Player thinks you have a Widescreen TV. Use SETUP or MENU buttons on your controller to set it to 4:3.\n\nIf you need any assistance, contact me : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3848515d4a67485051545148485d00007850574c55595154165b5755&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n-------------------\n\nFind out more: http://thisoneisonus.org\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b443deeb124af57b75ba4ab7e84471b4aa5ca41","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+Live+Australia+2009+%5BDVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b443deeb124af57b75ba4ab7e84471b4aa5ca41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,68,61,238,177,36,175,87,183,91,164,171,126,132,71,27,74,165,202,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
