And I shall do my best to protect you now that you have.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJessamin has been an outcast since she moved from her island home of Melei to the dreary country of Albion. Everything changes when she meets Finn, a gorgeous, enigmatic young lord who introduces her to the secret world of AlbionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nobility, a world that has everything Jessamin doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â€power, money, statusÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and magic. But Finn has secrets of his own, dangerous secrets that the vicious Lord Downpike will do anything to possess. Unless Jessamin, armed only with her wits and her determination, can stop him.\n\nKiersten White captured readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hearts with her New York Times bestselling Paranormalcy trilogy and its effortless mix of magic and real-world teenage humor. She returns to that winning combination of wit, charm, and enchantment in Illusions of Fate, a sparkling and romantic new novel perfect for fans of Cassandra Clare, The MadmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daughter, and Libba Bray.\n\n- - -\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF\nASIN#: B00H7LUQ5O\nISBN#: 9780062135919\nISBN13#: 0062135910\nPublished: September 9th, 2014\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8981892c6257cabea044e7edd656aa907d28d91","amp;dn":"Illusions+of+Fate+-+Kiersten+White","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8981892c6257cabea044e7edd656aa907d28d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,152,24,146,198,37,124,171,234,4,78,126,221,101,106,169,7,210,141,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
