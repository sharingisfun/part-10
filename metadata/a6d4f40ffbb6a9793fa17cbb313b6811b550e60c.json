The band is strong, Robert's voice is in fair shape and Jimmy is blazing, especially on a great and very long version of Dazed And Confused and an epic Stairway To Heaven solo. Roll Over Beethoven is only a short vocal rehearsal but one of the encores features Ronnie Wood on second guitar, dueling with Page as they trade licks in an extended jam that sounds killer when Jonesy and Bonham jam behind it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6d4f40ffbb6a9793fa17cbb313b6811b550e60c","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.02.13+Uniondale%2C+New+York+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6d4f40ffbb6a9793fa17cbb313b6811b550e60c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,212,244,15,251,182,169,121,63,161,124,187,49,59,104,17,181,80,230,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
