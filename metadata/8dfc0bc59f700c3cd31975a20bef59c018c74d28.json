It will upset a sensitive soul\nto view this material before they have attained maturity to maintain the required perspective with inner strength which only comes from rightly guided wisdom.\n\n\nThat said, much is made of this movie in denigrating the peoples of Rome and this\nis a miscarriage of justice in fact. In my view only one woman of the most obviously clearly supreme Christianly beauty is cast - the Germanic supreme\nbeauty of Ms. Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla is gifted to us on the screen to \nenjoy.\n\nThat said, Germanicus Caligula is in fact a fiend (sic) to the people of Rome\nas that is what we see him to be to Drusilla too and to all others that\ndeserve better human sanity in their midst. No doubt this butchering maniac\nwas to himself superior in some fashion perhaps - but mainly he is insane with\nthe mind of a demonic bestial appetite for inane cruelties and what have you.\n\nThe true men of Rome must not bear his memory as their own as they bear no resemblance to him in whatever mode of spirit he may choose to employ as they\nmust remain as pope if they are to remain as Romans in their own hearts in truth.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\n\n1280 X 720p Xvid HD 3600k video bitrate 256k audio 2hrs 36min\n\nin English with srt subtitles included for the following languages:\n\nBulgarian\nDutch\nEnglish\nFrench\nGreek\nItalian\nPolish\nPortuguese\nRomanian\nRussian\nSpanish\n- we'll try to make other languages available too especially matching\nSwedish and German which are at present missing from the available\nselections on the net when last checked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dfc0bc59f700c3cd31975a20bef59c018c74d28","amp;dn":"Caligula+1979+The+Imperial+Edition+720p+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+XviD+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dfc0bc59f700c3cd31975a20bef59c018c74d28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,252,11,197,159,112,12,60,211,25,117,162,11,239,89,192,24,199,77,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
