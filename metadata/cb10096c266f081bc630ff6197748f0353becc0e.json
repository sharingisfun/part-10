S. Lewis - Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer (Harcourt, Brace and World, 1964). 124 pages.\n\nNew scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nBeautifully written guide to prayer in the form of fictional letters between the author and &quot;Malcolm.&quot;\n\nfrom the book:\n\n&quot;We want to know not how we should pray if we were perfect but how we should pray being as we now are.&quot;\n\ndescription:\n\nWhat are we doing when we pray? What is at the heart of this most intimate conversation, the dialogue between a person and God? How does prayer - its form, its regularity, its content, its insistence - shape who we are and how we believe? In this collection of letters from C. S. Lewis to a close friend, Malcolm, we see an intimate side of Lewis as he considers all aspects of prayer and how this singular ritual impacts the lives and souls of the faithful. With depth, wit, and intelligence, as well as his sincere sense of a continued spiritual journey, Lewis brings us closer to understanding the role of prayer in our lives and the ways in which we might better imagine our relationship with God.\n\n&quot;A beautifully executed and deeply moving little book.&quot; - Saturday Review\n\n&quot;[Lewis] is writing about a path that he had to find, and the reader feels not so much that he is listening to what C.S. Lewis has to say but that he is making his own search with a humorous, sensible friend beside him.&quot; - Times Literary Supplement\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nC. S.
