The show, which took place Jan. 30, climaxed the week-long Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival in Montego Bay, with special guests including reggae legend Maxi Priest and R&amp;B star Billy Ocean. This show, featuring seven of the songs from their festival set, includes the Hall &amp; Oates classics &quot;Maneater,&quot; &quot;Say It Isn't So,&quot; &quot;One on One,&quot; and covers of &quot;Love TKO&quot; and Billy Ocean's &quot;Carribean Queen.&quot;\n\nT-Bone Wolk was the co-producer/musical director and bassist/guitarist for Daryl Hall and John Oates for nearly 30 years, starting with their 1981 album, Private Eyes. He was also the co-producer for many H&amp;O albums, as well as Daryl Hall solo albums. The next installment of Live From Daryl's House, marking a milestone 30th episode in the series, will be a musical tribute to his memory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c38c88c2e0ec139c3566b232e8b3a29c2e0a285e","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%5C%27s.House.E29.Maxi.Priest.Billy.Ocea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c38c88c2e0ec139c3566b232e8b3a29c2e0a285e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,140,136,194,224,236,19,156,53,102,178,50,232,179,162,156,46,10,40,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
