Vehicles based on these technologies are described in terms of performance, fuel economy, environmental impact, energy sources and costs, and are extensively compared and contrasted to conventional vehicles.For the most advanced concepts in development (fuel cell and long-range electric vehicles), the issue of recharging infrastructure is addressed, as are case studies of alternative vehicles proposed by major automakers.\n\nIn the last 10ÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36fdbd5ace61cbc1625a853ed9bee5d6863ca229","amp;dn":"Electric+and+Hybrid+Vehicles+%282010%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36fdbd5ace61cbc1625a853ed9bee5d6863ca229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,253,189,90,206,97,203,193,98,90,133,62,217,190,229,214,134,60,162,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
