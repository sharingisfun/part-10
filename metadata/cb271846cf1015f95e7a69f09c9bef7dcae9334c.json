Unlike any other catch ever attempted, they'll lift an SUV-sized shark onto a platform, mount a long-lasting tracking tag by hand, take measurements and DNA samples, and release it unharmed... all within minutes. Marine biologist Dr. Michael Domeier uses advanced tracking devices to help uncover how this predator lives, with the ultimate goal of conserving and protecting this endangered species.\n\nPlot:\n----------\nHow well can you handle the great white shark? Join the shark research team as you measure the catch, tag it with a GPS tracking device, and take a blood sample. Watch out, this is one slippery animal.\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Avi\nVideo Codec: MPEG-4 Video (xvid)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nResolution: 624x352\nFrame Rate: 29.976215\nAudio Codec: MPEG Audio layer 1/2/3 (mpga)\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 128 kb/s\nSource: TV Rips\nAir Date: 2009\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n----------\n\nMUST SEE YouTube Trailer:\n\nIMDb:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596259/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596259/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/shark-attack-experiment-live/interactives/expedition-great-white/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/shark-attack-experiment-live/interactives/expedition-great-white/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb271846cf1015f95e7a69f09c9bef7dcae9334c","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Expedition+Great+White+Season+1+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb271846cf1015f95e7a69f09c9bef7dcae9334c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,39,24,70,207,16,21,249,94,122,105,240,156,155,239,125,202,233,51,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
