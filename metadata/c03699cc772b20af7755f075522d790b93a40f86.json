It is based on a book by Barbara Branden (one of Rand's former associates and Nathaniel Branden's first wife).\n\nThe film stars Helen Mirren as the philosopher and novelist Ayn Rand, who engages into an affair with a psychologist 25 years her junior by the name of Nathaniel Branden, played by Eric Stoltz. Branden built up an institute to spread Rand's ideas, but the two eventually had a falling out due to her ego. The film also stars Julie Delpy as Branden's wife, Barbara, and Peter Fonda as Rand's husband Frank O'Connor.\n\nThis film won several awards for Helen Mirren, including the Emmy and the Golden Globe.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_Ayn_Rand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_Ayn_Rand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Passion-Ayn-Rand-Helen-Mirren/dp/B000056BP0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1238197573&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Passion-Ayn-Rand-Helen-Mirren/dp/B000056BP0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1238197573&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03699cc772b20af7755f075522d790b93a40f86","amp;dn":"The+Passion+of+Ayn+Rand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03699cc772b20af7755f075522d790b93a40f86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,54,153,204,119,43,32,175,119,85,240,117,82,45,121,11,147,164,15,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
