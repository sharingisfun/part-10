Unauthorized and accidental changes in files and\n\tfolder structure, permissions, file shares, and other objects\n\tcan significantly impact your users and infrastructure by \n\tfacilitating data theft and security threats.\n\n\tNetWrix File Server Change Reporter is a tool that audits\n\timportant file server changes. The tool sends daily reports\n\tabout all changes to the file servers for your review, including\n\tchanges made to files, folders, shares, and permissions with\n\tprevious and new values of certain configuration values. \n\n\tThis tool provides information about who made the change and\n\twhen it occurred, including detailed information about\n\tpermission changes. \n\n\tAnother example is employee retirement: User accounts must\n\tbe disabled when an employee quits an organization, but in\n\tpractice, IT departments are usually the last to know when\n\tsomebody leaves. Also, most HR databases only keep information\n\tabout the &quot;primary&quot; user account and know nothing about\n\tadditional user accounts.\n\nProduct features:\n\n    \t* Monitoring day-to-day modifications to mitigate the risks\n\tassociated with delegated administration\n\n    \t* Proactively reporting data loss and unauthorized user\n\tactivity\n\n    \t* Enforcing compliance with regulations, such as\n\tSarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and others.\n\n    \t* Archiving all changes to help with the investigation of\n\tchanges made months and years ago\n\n\t\nFor More info about Netwrix Inactive Users Tracker Visit:\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.netwrix.com/products.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.netwrix.com/products.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n\n\t- Install fscrfull_setup.msi\n\t- Replace FSCR.exe + NetWrixLib.dll\n\t- FSCR is now fully registered.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ababeabe8e7c89d997e13b49a2ffdee6bfe22830","amp;dn":"Netwrix+File+Server+Change+Reporter+1.3.40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ababeabe8e7c89d997e13b49a2ffdee6bfe22830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,171,234,190,142,124,137,217,151,225,59,73,162,255,222,230,191,226,40,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
