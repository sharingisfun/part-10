From the defunct Elseworlds line of DC Comics, here are over two dozen one-shot and mini-series stories featuring the Justice League. (Kingdom Come, arguably the most famous Elseworlds title, isn't included.)\n\nAll credit goes to the original scanners, and to whoever collected and organized these. Please seed and share with our friends here at TPB!  --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nThis torrent contains:\n\nLeague of Justice (1996) *2 issues\nSuperman/Wonder Woman: Whom Gods Destroy (1997) *Chris Claremont\nJustice Riders (1997) *J.H. Williams III\nJustice League of America: The Nail (1998) *Alan Davis *Trade paperback\nJLA: Secret Society of Super-Heroes (2000) *2 issues\nJLA: Created Equal (2000) *2 issues\nJLA: Seven Caskets (2000) *Dan Brereton\nJLA: Act of God (2001) *Trade paperback\nJLA: Riddle of the Beast (2001)\nJLA: Destiny (2002) *4 issues\nJLA: The Island of Doctor Moreau (2002)\nJLA: Shogun of Steel (2002)\nPlanetary/JLA - Terra Occulta (2002) *Warren Ellis, Jerry Ordway\nJLA: Age of Wonder (2003) *2 issues\nJustice League of America: Another Nail (2004) *Alan Davis *3 issues\n\n------\n\nIn Elseworlds, super-heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into strange times and places - some that have existed, and others that can't, couldn't or shouldn't exist. The result is stories that make characters who are as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebead9fb24c2c6c7e63816997794383b59baa1cc","amp;dn":"JUSTICE+LEAGUE+-+ELSEWORLDS+%281996-2004%29+%28DC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebead9fb24c2c6c7e63816997794383b59baa1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,234,217,251,36,194,198,199,230,56,22,153,119,148,56,59,89,186,161,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
