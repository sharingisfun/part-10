The same can be claimed of is colleagues\nhere who share a strong sense for form also while improvising\ntogether. Abercrombie: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe free improvs sound more like chamber music rather\nthan free jazz nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: not only a reflection on the emphasis on strings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar,\nviolin, bass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but also of the advanced harmonic awareness of Mark Feldman, Marc\nJohnson and the leader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3883b0e663dc60268b8e5a9a099e0145e88a79","amp;dn":"John+Abercrombie+-+The+Third+Quartet+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3883b0e663dc60268b8e5a9a099e0145e88a79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,56,131,176,230,99,220,96,38,139,142,90,154,9,158,1,69,232,138,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
