While I know that including the likes of Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg may catch me  flak, I feel that those songs are 'slept-on' in the sense that the artists better known (lesser quality) songs get a lot more play.\n\nYour 'Thank you's' and comments are appreciate  ;) \n\n01. Eminem - Infinite (1996)\n-- Almost unknown Eminem song, before 'Slim Shady'. True hip-hop, at its finest. 90's beat and sick lyricism, reminds me of Illmatic\n\n02. The Last Emperor - Secret Wars (1998)\n-- Amazing concept song, rappers vs. comic book characters\n\n03. Big L - Put It On (1994)\n-- L is just slept-on, period. One of his best tracks\n\n04. Blackstar - Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli - Thieves In The Night (1998)\n-- The Mos Def verse in this songs is one of the hardest hitting - ever\n\n05. Crooklyn Dodgers '95 - Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers (1995)\n-- Lesser known than its 1994 counterpart, the beat and verses are perfect, some real New York hip-hop\n\n06. Pharoahe Monch - The Truth ft. Common &amp; Talib Kweli (1999)\n-- Sick collaboration between the three when they were at their best\n\n07. Lupe Fiasco - The Coolest (2007)\n-- Not a mainstream hit, the delivery from Lupe is one-of-a-kind\n\n08. Slug - God's Bathroom Floor (2003)\n-- &quot;Made a date with divinity but she wouldn't let me fuck...&quot;\n\n09. Killah Priest - One Step ft. Tekitha &amp; Hell (1998)\n-- This oft-sampled beat was first used here, in the best version\n\n10. Binary Star - Reality Check (1999)\n-- Truly original lyricism - &quot;Rodney King never felt the beat like this...&quot;\n\n11. Brother Ali - Uncle Sam Goddamn (1997)\n-- Using music to actually say something, and sound so dope doing it\n\n12. Funkdoobiest - Rock On (1995)\n-- Simplistic beat works beautifully and the flow is so smooth\n\n13. Zion I - Let It Flow (2003)\n-- Production is unbelievable - The girl singing &quot;floooooooow&quot; in the background with the beat is haunting\n\n14. Black Moon - I Gotcha' Opin (Remix) (1992)\n-- Best known for &quot;Who Got The Props&quot;, this was their dopest track\n\n15. Cunninlynguists - Seasons ft. Masta Ace (RJD2) (2003)\n-- From 'RJD2 is God' - Cool concept and lyrics + ill beat\n\n16. CNN Capone N' Noreaga - Calm Down ft. Nas (1998)\n-- &quot;Music makes these thugs calm down...&quot; Nas' verse is so sick\n\n17. Souls of Mischief - 93 'Til Infinity (1993)\n-- One of the best beats of the 90's\n\n18. Jay-Z - Feelin' It (1996)\n-- Hard to say a Jay song is slept on - Oft-overlooked from his best work, 'Reasonable Doubt'. So good I had to put it on the list\n\n19. J-Live - Them That's Not (2001)\n-- Masterful production, super tight lyrics\n\n20. AZ - Rather Unique (1995)\n-- That chill hip-hop - the beat, lyrics, AZ in general, IS rather unique\n\n21. Masta Ace - Beautiful (1993)\n-- One of the illest songs from one of BK's best\n\n22. Smiff 'N' Wessun - Let's Get It On (1995)\n-- From Boot Camp Cliq - the beat is haunting, and the two MC's going back and forth is entirely engrossing\n\n23. Little Brother - Dreams (2007)\n-- &quot;Mama, I got dreams... but dreams don't keep the lights on...&quot; One of the tightest hooks I've ever heard\n\n24. Joell Ortiz - Hip-Hop (2007)\n-- Hard to believe this guy hasn't blown up yet - &quot;I ain't trying to bring New York back, I'm just a breathe of fresh air, that good ole' New York rap...&quot;\n\n25. Ariano -  R.I.P To The Radio ft. Prime (2008)\n-- I don't even know who this guy is, or how I heard this song - I'm just glad I did. Dope concept and execution\n\n26. Immortal Technique - Bin Ladin ft. Mos Def &amp; Eminem (2004)\n-- Using hip-hop to speak the truth - Tech's lyrics are so sick and the chorus with Mos Def is unforgettable\n\n27. Scientifik - Lawtown (1994)\n-- Little known underground classic\n\n28. Bun B - Pushin ft. Scarface and Young Jeezy (2005)\n-- All three, especially 'Face and Jeezy get off hard on a sick beat and hook\n\n29. Public Enemy - Shut Em' Down (Pete Rock Remix) (1991)\n-- The original is legendary, the Pete Rock Remix should be\n\n30. Cam'Ron - Killa Cam (2004)\n-- Kanye killed it with this production. Lyrics aren't top-notch but Cam sounds so good flowing on the beat\n\n31. XV - Fall Out The Sky (2009)\n-- Production is top-notch. New artist, has a Lupe type flow and some good lyrics her.\n\n32. Wordsworth - Shoulder (2004)\n-- Boston-area rapper - the strings on this are crazy good\n\n33. Paris - What Would You Do (2003)\n-- The George W. Bush intro is so funny - priceless. Great beat, chorus and even better lyricism\n\n34. 50 Cent - Power of the Dollar (1999)\n-- This is 50 before 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Also check out 'Good Die Young' and 'Ghetto Qu'ran' from the same album.\n\n35. Rakim - After You Die (2005)\n-- Dre murdered the beat and the hook. Tight lyrics and concept.\n\n36.

Snoop Dogg - Imagine ft. Dr. Dre (2006)\n-- One of the very best collaborations between the two. The piano and the beat are as good as it gets, and both Snoop and Dre spit high-quality verses.\n\n39. Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth - Take You There (9th Wonder Remix) (1999)\n-- The 9th Wonder Remix is something special, one of his best productions.\n\n40.
