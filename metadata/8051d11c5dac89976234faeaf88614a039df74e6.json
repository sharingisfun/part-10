Following this intuition I present to you along with the original album a selection of the same poems with soundtracks in the background (the Waits/Ginsberg combination is also included).\nThis may sound lame, but please give it a try because the results are sometimes really unexpected and inspiring.\n\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nPoems: Howl, Holy, A Supermarket in California, Transcription for organ music, America, In back of the real, A Strange new cottage in Berkley, Europe, Europe!, Kaddish, The Sunflower of Sutra.\n\nSoundtrack scores (not necessarily for the listed poems): Bach (Goldberg Variation no. 14), Creedence Clearwater Revival, Keith Jarret, Astor Piazzolla, Tom Waits, Beethoven (Sonata for Piano and Cello in C, IÃ‚Â°), Gianmaria Testa.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\nencoded MP3LAME 192/256 VBR &amp; properly tagged &amp; named\n\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\nripped &amp; RAR-packed by nonhocapito","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8051d11c5dac89976234faeaf88614a039df74e6","amp;dn":"Allen+Ginsberg+-+Howl+and+other+poems+%28plus+soundtrack+experimen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8051d11c5dac89976234faeaf88614a039df74e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,81,209,28,93,172,137,151,98,52,250,234,248,134,20,160,57,223,116,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
