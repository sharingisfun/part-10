You may look at the pictures and think this is some other country. But this is indeed Lithuania. Unseen Lithuania. LithuaniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s landscape is just as impressive as that of the best known and most often visited countries of the world. We do not have snow-covered peaks, scorched deserts, deadly volcanoes or coral reefs that look like theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been painted by children. However, only in Lithuania there are tower hills remembering ancient heroes, a narrow thread of land between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea, the unique patterns of meandering rivers and lake islands, sand dunes caressed by the ever-eager sea, towns by the edge of the water and impressive churches that look like spaceships ready for launch. Nowhere else does the green colour have so many shades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9868ab6be6d0b5c100d05d34169b90d34e329878","amp;dn":"Unseen+Lithuania+-+Neregeta+Lietuva","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9868ab6be6d0b5c100d05d34169b90d34e329878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,104,171,107,230,208,181,193,0,208,93,52,22,155,144,211,78,50,152,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
