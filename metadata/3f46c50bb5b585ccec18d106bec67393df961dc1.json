And who wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be? Beautiful women, money, a job that I could sleep through and still make bank. But I was bored. And I never could walk away from a challenge. \n\nThis challenge turned out to be brunette. Feisty. Just the way I like them. But innocent. Too innocent for me. Too innocent to do anything other than sample and then toss back. Anything more would be too risky, too much work. \n\nI was unprepared for Julia Campbell. I should have done my homework, should have looked before diving into unfamiliar waters. Ditching her proved to be problematic, my sexual needs greater than my common sense. \n\nShe was different. She became more than a challenge. \n\nShe may just bring my world crashing down. \n\nThis novella is meant to complement, and be read after, Blindfolded Innocence, a #1 Erotica Bestseller.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f46c50bb5b585ccec18d106bec67393df961dc1","amp;dn":"The+Diary+of+Brad+De+Luca+%28Innocence+%231.5%29+-+Alessandra+Torre+%5BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f46c50bb5b585ccec18d106bec67393df961dc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,70,197,11,181,181,133,204,236,24,209,6,190,198,115,147,223,150,29,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
