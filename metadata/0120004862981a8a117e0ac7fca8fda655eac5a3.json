Downing is known in the contemporary jazz and R&amp;B music genres for his rich baritone vocals, and his interpretations of R&amp;B and pop classics that stretch back to the early 1980s. Downing is married to singer Audrey Wheeler, who has collaborated with various musicians as a back-up singer.\n\nNow I do believe all of you know of Will Downing, he is in the class of Luther Vandross, Peabo Bryson, Jeffrey Osborne, Howard Hewitt and the like. He like the aforementioned is the epitome of the BLACK MALE VOICE, smooth, rich, controlled, awesome. \n\nI have been a fan of Mr. Downing for some years now and he has never failed to impress with his interpretations of many classic hits, even some sung by women. It is often hard for a man to sing a song made famous by a woman, by Will did an excellent job of the song FREE by Denice Williams and another song called I CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME by a country and western singer named Bonnie Raitt. As a matter of fact Will did a better job of these songs than the original singers in my opinion, but you listen and make your choice.\n\nI believe I have compiled every album done by Will Downing so far with his career stretching over twenty years (2088 - Present).\n\nSo sit back and enjoy this smooth crooner as he works his vocal magic\n\nAlbums Included:\n\n1988 - Will Downing\n1991 - A Dream Fulfilled\n1993 - Love Is The Place To Be\n1996 - Moods\n1997 - Invitation Only\n2000 - Greatest love Songs\n2002 - Sensual Journey\n2003 - Emotions\n2004 - Christmas Love &amp; You\n2005 - Soul Symphony\n2007 - After Tonight\n2008 - Come Together As One\n2009 - Classique\n2010 - Lust, Love, Lies\n\nSINGLES\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0120004862981a8a117e0ac7fca8fda655eac5a3","amp;dn":"WILL+DOWNING+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0120004862981a8a117e0ac7fca8fda655eac5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,32,0,72,98,152,26,138,17,126,10,199,252,168,253,166,85,234,197,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
