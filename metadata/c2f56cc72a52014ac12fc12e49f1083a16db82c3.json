But few realize the health consequences they are suffering as a result of modernity's increasingly sedentary lifestyle, or the effects it has had on society at large. In Get Up! , health expert James A. Levine's original scientific research shows that today's chair-based world, where we no longer use our bodies as they evolved to be used, is having negative consequences on our health, and is a leading cause of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Over the decades, humans have moved from a primarily active lifestyle to one that is largely sedentary, and this change has reshaped every facet of our livesÃ¢â‚¬â€from social interaction to classroom design. Levine shows how to throw off the shackles of inertia and reverse these negative trends through simple changes in our daily lives.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2f56cc72a52014ac12fc12e49f1083a16db82c3","amp;dn":"Get+Up%21%3A+Why+Your+Chair+is+Killing+You+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2f56cc72a52014ac12fc12e49f1083a16db82c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,245,108,199,42,82,1,74,193,47,193,46,73,241,8,58,22,219,130,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
