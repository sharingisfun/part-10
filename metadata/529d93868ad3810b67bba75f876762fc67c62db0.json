Most of the band's lyrics are written by Nolan, though Pointer contributed lyrics to Sirens and other tracks on the first two albums.\nMusically the band's style ranges from symphonic to hard rock. Some of the band's recent albums have a similar sound to Nolan's earlier band, Shadowland.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:529d93868ad3810b67bba75f876762fc67c62db0","amp;dn":"Arena-10+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"529d93868ad3810b67bba75f876762fc67c62db0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,157,147,134,138,211,129,11,103,187,167,95,135,103,98,252,103,198,45,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
