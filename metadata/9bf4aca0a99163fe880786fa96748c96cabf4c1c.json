She has a publicaccount and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and sheâ€™ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonightâ€”the perfect place for a â€œchanceâ€ meeting.\r\n\r\nAs Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beckâ€™s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beckâ€™s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their wayâ€”even if it means murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Santino Fontana\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bf4aca0a99163fe880786fa96748c96cabf4c1c","amp;dn":"Caroline+Kepnes+-+You+%28You+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bf4aca0a99163fe880786fa96748c96cabf4c1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,244,172,160,169,145,99,254,136,7,134,250,150,116,140,150,202,191,76,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
