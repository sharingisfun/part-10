It is the story of a beautiful young Irish girl and her quest for knowledge. On her journey she meets a wise man who teaches her to overcome fear and a woman who teaches her how to dance to the hidden music of the world. They see in her a gift, but must let her make her own voyage of discovery. As Brida seeks her destiny, she struggles to find a balance between her relationships and her desire to transform herself. The story is neatly woven around the ancient belief of witchcraft and related to the present world in an interesting way.\n\n--\nsandhed at safe-mail.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff177998b1d31317aa89aa9b05ae28befaa22ea","amp;dn":"Paulo+Coelho+-+Brida+%5Bhoerbuch+audiobook+deutsch+german%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ff177998b1d31317aa89aa9b05ae28befaa22ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,241,119,153,139,29,49,49,122,168,154,169,176,90,226,139,239,170,34,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
