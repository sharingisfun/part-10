This covers three solid years of FF material, starting with issue 489 (with dual numbering from the previous volume split, so actually labeled 60-489) and continuing up until issue 524 (with the original numbering restored). Taken from a larger FF torrent, all credit to the original scanners. I know there's a bunch of Hickman run torrents out there so I wanted to make one for the Waid run as well. I actually have every issue of Fantastic Four/FF including the current run by Matt Fraction that ends soon, so if anyone likes these smaller torrents then lmk and I'll try and categorize more stuff from various creators (thinking Peter David's Hulk or Walt Simonson's Thor, etc.). Anyway, hope that helps a bit and as always, enjoy and please seed. Happy New Year to all! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32e7fb54b05437b1c90e3ad3771b147e6bc6ff8","amp;dn":"Fantastic+Four+-+Complete+Mark+Waid+Run+%282002-2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32e7fb54b05437b1c90e3ad3771b147e6bc6ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,46,127,181,75,5,67,123,28,144,227,173,55,113,177,71,230,188,111,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
