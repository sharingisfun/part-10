We want success; we want people to think weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re good (or witty or insightful or intelligent or brilliant); we want to be noticed; we want to be remembered; we want attention.\n\nSo some of us keep blogs.\n\nIf I get over status anxiety it will probably mean not ever, ever, checking my blog stats. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just for a start.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going to read the book, because IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m really impressed. He gets to the malaise of society and of me with insightful and clear analysis, while also being interesting.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ef0a638487991539ed896c18d3bd68eda8515f","amp;dn":"Status+Anxiety+2004+%28all+3+parts%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ef0a638487991539ed896c18d3bd68eda8515f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,239,10,99,132,135,153,21,57,237,137,108,24,211,189,104,237,168,81,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
