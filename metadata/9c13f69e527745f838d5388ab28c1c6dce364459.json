That said, I will go out on a limb and proclaim this as my favorite &quot;Tristan&quot; DVD.\n\nIt's true that this Heiner Muller production faces very strong competition from both the Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and Nikolaus Lehnhoff versions--all three are visually and conceptually striking (Peter Konwitschny's production, probably the most daring of all, has some brilliant moments but is saddled with too many inexplicable, maddening misfires to stand in the first rank). If Amazon someday releases last year's televised La Scala performance directed by Patrice Chereau, which (like the Muller and Ponnelle) features Barenboim conducting and (like the Muller and Konwitschny) offers Waltraud Meier as Isolde, it will most likely join the above big three in the upper echelon.\n\nLike Ponnelle and Lehnhoff, Muller creates an arrestingly beautiful production, though more austere than the other two. The German playwright allegedly tried to take a colder, more clinical view of Wagner's great paean to unfulfilled passion, but his Bayreuth &quot;Tristan&quot; manages to be all the more affecting because of its sober restraint (a restraint very much in keeping, after all, with Wagner's lovers, who spend an entire stolen night of love doing nothing but philosophizing).
