On this particular CD reissue, Coltrane performs &quot;Rise and Shine,&quot; &quot;I See Your Face Before Me,&quot; &quot;If There Is Someone Lovelier Than You,&quot; and &quot;Little Melonae.&quot; But more significant than the material are Coltrane's searching and passionate improvisations, which were pointing the way toward the future. This music ( along with Trane's other Prestige recordings ) is also available as part of his huge Prestige Recordings box set. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane ( Tenor Saxophone ) \nRed Garland ( Piano ) \nPaul Chambers ( Double Bass ) \nArthur Taylor ( Drums ) \n\nJohn Coltrane - Settin' the Pace Tracks:\n01  I See Your Face Before Me ( Howard Dietz/Arthur Schwartz ) 10:00 \n02  If There Is Someone Lovelier Than You ( Howard Dietz/Arthur Schwartz ) 7:15 \n03  Little Melonae ( Jackie McLean ) 14:08\n04  Rise 'N' Shine ( Buddy DeSylva/Vincent Youmans ) 9:23.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58158b5554686a81485380fcefa3309d7820bc3","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Settin%5C%27+the+Pace+%281958%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58158b5554686a81485380fcefa3309d7820bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,129,88,181,85,70,134,168,20,133,56,15,206,250,51,9,215,130,11,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
