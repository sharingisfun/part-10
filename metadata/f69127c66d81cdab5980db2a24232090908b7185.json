Starring Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph\n\nThese episodes have been collected in the order of their transmission date as far as possible. The original &amp;#039;Lost episodes&amp;#039; DVDs were in awful shape and I&amp;#039;ve tried to do the best possible from them. Here is all the episodes from &amp;#039;The Jackie Gleason show&amp;#039; 1956-1957. Also included are all bonus features from said discs. This includes the undated episodes and collection specials.\n\nPart 1 can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3575629/The_Honeymooners_-_The_Lost_Episodes_1952-55\n\n\nAs for seeding: I will try to seed 100% 24/7 until each part is available, but my ISP have it&amp;#039;s glitches and I&amp;#039;ll only be able to fix it during evenings CET. My upload speed should be about 768kbit/s assuming everything is OK. I&amp;#039;ll upload the next part as soon as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69127c66d81cdab5980db2a24232090908b7185","amp;dn":"The+Honeymooners+-+The+Lost+Episodes+1956-57+and+specials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69127c66d81cdab5980db2a24232090908b7185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,145,39,198,109,129,205,171,89,128,219,42,36,35,32,144,144,139,113,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
