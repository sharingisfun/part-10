Add these to your device via Mail, AirDrop, or some other method in order to be able to update to the betas OTA (over the air) in Settings.\r\n\r\nI previously added torrents for the IPSWs but am unable to sustain them, so this is a much lighter alternative.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and seed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing the configuration profile\r\n\r\n- You'll see two configuration profiles - iOS 10 and watchOS 3. Choose one or both configuration profiles depending on which betas you want.\r\n- Next, get it onto your iPhone. Email it to yourself, upload and download it from the cloud, or use osmosis. Do what you have to do.\r\n- When you download it to the device, it will open. Click install. If you have an Apple Watch, choose the appropriate device per profile.\r\n- Go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Software Update.\r\n\r\nAs always, betas will be problematic in areas, so don't update unless you're willing to put up with some performance, battery, and bug issues. Please help the community and Apple out by reporting any issues to https://bugreport.apple.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:342084f3d5718ba28e867c8dc9ae9157bd77ae97","amp;dn":"iOS_10_watchOS_3_beta_OTA_configuration_profile.mobileconfig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"342084f3d5718ba28e867c8dc9ae9157bd77ae97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,32,132,243,213,113,139,162,142,134,124,141,201,174,145,87,189,119,174,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
