Until recently it was home to Leonid Meyer, a reclusive elderly Jew who, like many of his neighbors, came here long ago to escape one of Europe's various bloodbaths. But Meyer's refuge ultimately became his coffin, the carnage crowned with a gigantic swastika. A racit murder? Inspector Ikmen has his doubts, and begins tracking down the few people who might have known the old man, including a faded prostitute, a shadowy family of Russian emigres, a dispairing rabbi, and a high-strung young Englishman in the throes of erotic obsession. The first in a stunningly atmospheric new series from a writer who has deservedly been compared with Michael Dibdin and Donna Leon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8546118f116959bc6891cccb269cfd02396291d4","amp;dn":"Barbara+Nadel+-+Belshazzar%27s+Daughter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8546118f116959bc6891cccb269cfd02396291d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,70,17,143,17,105,89,188,104,145,204,203,38,156,253,2,57,98,145,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
