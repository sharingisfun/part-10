It was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in Australia, Europe, Japan and North America in April 2010. In Japan, the game was an Xbox 360 exclusive titled Nier Gestalt, while an alternate version titled Nier Replicant was released for PlayStation 3 with a younger main character. The game follows the titular Nier as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, that his daughter Yonah has succumbed to. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, KainÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures, Shades, that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, switching to them from the primary action role-playing style.\n\nThe game was developed to appeal both to older players and to players outside of Japan, where the developer was based. The music was composed by Keiichi Okabe, head of Monaca, a music composition studio, and has sparked the release of several albums. Nier was released to mixed reception; reviewers praised the story, characters and soundtrack and were mixed in their opinions of how well the disparate gameplay elements were connected. Criticism was given for the execution of some gameplay elements, particularly the side quests, and was especially pronounced for the graphics, which were regarded as substandard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59523871e122feb44e5cf7c5c298e32f57565c83","amp;dn":"NIER+%5BPS3%5D%5BPAL%5D%5BENGLISH%5D%5BSillyRabbitTrixAreForKids%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59523871e122feb44e5cf7c5c298e32f57565c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,82,56,113,225,34,254,180,78,92,247,197,194,152,227,47,87,86,92,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
