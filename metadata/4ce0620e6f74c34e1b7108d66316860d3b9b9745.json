ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about a group of five friends -- little tree creatures who set out on a journey to save the last seed from their home tree, which is infested by evil parasites. The gameplay is about exploration, solving little funny puzzles, meeting strange tree creatures, and paying attention to the music as it provides you with useful clues and hints. The whole game takes place on one huge and strange tree that is inhabited by bizarre and freaky creatures.\n\nThis is not an ordinary game. It is far from it. Everything about it is curiously unique and very surreal, and that alone makes it worth checking out. It's just not possible to be bored in this game, as every new location brings something new and intriguing. The exploration elements are made with incredible polish and attention to detail, and the same applies to the musical score, sound effects, and, most importantly, the visuals. The synergy of those elements create a beautiful and memorable adventure that is enthralling beyond measure.\n\n\nAge requirements: PEGI Rating: 7+ with Fear, Violence.\n\nMinimum system requirements: WindowsÃ‚Â® XP / VistaÃ‚Â® / WindowsÃ‚Â® 7, 1.8 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 2GB HDD.\n\nInstall and Play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ce0620e6f74c34e1b7108d66316860d3b9b9745","amp;dn":"Botanicula+%282.0.0.9%29+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ce0620e6f74c34e1b7108d66316860d3b9b9745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,224,98,14,111,116,195,78,27,113,8,214,99,22,134,13,59,155,151,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
