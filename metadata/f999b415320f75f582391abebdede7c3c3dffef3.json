These are the courageous men and women who forge headfirst into danger when everyone else is running the other way. But the enormous responsibilities of the job also take a personal toll.\n\nWith big reputations and hefty egos, the pressure to perform and make split-second decisions is bound to put squad members at odds. When a tragedy claims one of their own, there's plenty of guilt and blame to go around. In the middle of a divorce, Lt. Matthew Casey tries to go about business as usual, but can't help butting heads with the brash Lt. Kelly Severide of the Rescue Squad - and each blames the other for their fallen team member. When it's &quot;go-time,&quot; though, they put their differences aside and put everything on the line for each other. This is a look inside one of America's noblest professions.\n\nFrom renowned Emmy-winning producer Dick Wolf and the writing team behind &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; comes an edge-of-your-seat view of a dirty job that often means the difference between life and death.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f999b415320f75f582391abebdede7c3c3dffef3","amp;dn":"Chicago.Fire.S02E18.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f999b415320f75f582391abebdede7c3c3dffef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,153,180,21,50,15,117,245,130,57,26,190,189,237,231,195,195,223,254,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
