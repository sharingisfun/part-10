The stunning sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and the European colonies in Southeast Asia was the beginning of six months of unbroken conquests for the forces of Imperial Japan. But finally the Allied forces rallied, and they began the long fight to win back the Pacific. The Allies began their first strategic offensive against Japan with landings on the Solomon Islands and Admiral Halsey's Battle of the Bismarck Sea helped neutralize the Japanese Offensive. These along with millions of small triumphs in bloody foxholes, in flaming cockpits, in blasting gun turrets all helped bring victory to the Allied Forces during WWII. THE BATTLES THAT DOOMED JAPAN chronicles the bloody island hopping campaign that eventually turned the tide of World War II. Stunning combat footage captures the brutality of the fight for the Solomon Islands, the epic engagement at Midway and the crucial campaign fought by the British forces in Burma. We'll also see what happened in overlooked encounters like the battle for Port Moresby and the short-lived Japanese attack on the Aleutian islands! And we'll examine the increasingly desperate tactics that marked Japan's final effort to deny the inevitable as the end drew near. From the cockpits to the foxholes, this is a detailed look at the pivotal moments that helped bring World War II to a close. \r\n\r\nA Lou Reda Production for the History Channel\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Turning-the-Axis-Tide-The-Battles-that-Doomed-Japan-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 009 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 704x536\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 4:3\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 8mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.08 GB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Turning_the_Axis_Tide:_The_Battles_that_Doomed_Japan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13f24b3fa1f3f7755fda2fadf4609c3333d18f90","amp;dn":"HC+Turning+the+Axis+Tide+The+Battles+that+Doomed+Japan+x264+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13f24b3fa1f3f7755fda2fadf4609c3333d18f90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,242,75,63,161,243,247,117,95,218,47,173,244,96,156,51,51,209,143,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
