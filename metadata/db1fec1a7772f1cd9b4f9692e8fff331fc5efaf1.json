The unique applied approach fully engages you in discovering how the human body works and responds to exercise. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not only gain a solid foundation in exercise physiology concepts, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to apply these concepts on the job to optimize athletic performance and well-being.  Moreover, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come to understand the vital health benefits of exercise and physical activity for all individuals at all ages, including special populations.\n \nBeginning with basic exercise physiology concepts, the text progressively builds your knowledge by integrating these concepts into practical discussions of nutrition and training. The text stresses a research-based approach, enabling you to locate and evaluate the evidence you need to make good decisions.  Numerous examples further underscore the importance of basic concepts and research in addressing real-life challenges in exercise and athletic training.\n\n\nHardcover: 512 pages\nPublisher: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; 1 Har/Psc edition (March 1, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0781783518\nISBN-13: 978-0781783514","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1fec1a7772f1cd9b4f9692e8fff331fc5efaf1","amp;dn":"Exercise+Physiology%3A+Integrating+Theory+and+Application%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1fec1a7772f1cd9b4f9692e8fff331fc5efaf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,31,236,26,119,114,241,205,155,79,150,146,232,255,243,49,252,94,250,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
