Most importantly, Redish shows how vulnerabilities, or &quot;failure-modes,&quot; in the decision-making system can lead to serious dysfunctions, such as irrational behavior, addictions, problem gambling, and PTSD.\nTold with verve and humor in an easily readable style, Redish makes these difficult concepts understandable. Ranging widely from the surprising roles of emotion, habit, and narrative in decision-making, to the larger philosophical questions of how mind and brain are related, what makes us human, the nature of morality, free will, and the conundrum of robotics and consciousness, The Mind within the Brain offers fresh insight into one of the most complex aspects of human behavior.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dae01a26b9fbd2a5766c8c166d3612607d774e8","amp;dn":"The+Mind+within+the+Brain+by+A.+Ddish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dae01a26b9fbd2a5766c8c166d3612607d774e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,174,1,162,107,159,189,42,87,102,200,193,102,211,97,38,7,215,116,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
