The story is about people living in both sides of the ever increasingly fortified frontier between Israel and the Palestinian territory. Principally it is a story about a Palestinian widow living in the West Bank, Salma Zidane, fighting to save her lemon tree orchard from the paranoid reality of Israeli security politics.  \n\nThis movie is above all a drama about strength of conviction, and about will. The two main characters of the film, Salma and Mira Navon (wife of the Israeli Defense Minister) are women who toil within the chauvinist world of their respective cultural and socio-political circumstances.  Both fight to find their voice, their space and their lives. It's about the barriers that both women have to face, and about the physical, mental and cultural walls between people.\n\nThis is a nuanced and touching film about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  There is a lot of strength and feeling in this movie that is beautiful to behold.  Neither side is presented as being perfect and having all the 'right' solutions.The film is slow moving and very thoughtful  - there is a complexity in the characters and story.  The direction and scripting are exemplary, the performances are engrossing and compelling.\n\nAlthough this film is melancholic, it is replete with wonderful humor, and in the final analysis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ optimism!\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172963/\nIMDB Rating: 7.2/10 (700 Votes)\nRuntime: 106 Minutes\nLanguage: Hebrew and Arabic (with English subtitles)\n\nAwards: \n- 2008 Israeli Film Academy Awards in the category ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest Actress (Hiam Abbass)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest Director\n    (Eran Riklis)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest Art Direction (Miguel Markin)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest Costume Design (Rona Doran)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n- 2008 Berlin International Film Festival ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPanorama Audience Award (Director Eran Riklis)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f258220bb08d73a0115f46650a2e0e47b2068663","amp;dn":"Lemon+Tree+%28Etz+Limon%29.2008.English+subtitles.DvDrip.Avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f258220bb08d73a0115f46650a2e0e47b2068663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,88,34,11,176,141,115,160,17,95,70,101,10,46,14,71,178,6,134,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
