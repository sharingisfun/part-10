A fast talker with outlandish frenetic energy, Eddie's charming naivete always seems to get the two into hot water. But no matter what the situation, these opposites always end up bailing each other out -- even if they drive each other crazy.\n\nWhen the guys unexpectedly became recipients of a considerable sum of money, Malcolm and Eddie decided to buy not only the old Irish pub below their apartment, but the entire building, including Eddie's garage, as an investment. As new bar owners, the guys gave the place a face lift by turning it into a sports bar and renaming it McGee's.\n\nThere, they hang out with local regulars, including Tim, a gentle giant working as a male nurse, and Nicolette, the motor-mouth police academy cadet with a love-crazed obsession for Eddie. As Malcolm manages McGee's and Eddie tries to bolster his fledgling one-man/one-truck towing operation into a fleet, success for these two could be as simple as staying out of trouble.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc80d4e800b94dd532fef7fd0fe584567e0594c7","amp;dn":"Malcolm+and+Eddie+-+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc80d4e800b94dd532fef7fd0fe584567e0594c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,128,212,232,0,185,77,213,50,254,247,253,15,229,132,86,126,5,148,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
