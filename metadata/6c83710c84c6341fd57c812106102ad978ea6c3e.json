Timbrell (Informa Healthcare, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nThis leading textbook in the field examines the mechanisms underlying toxicity, particularly the events at the molecular level and the factors that determine and affect toxicity. The new edition is updated to reflect the latest research into the biochemical basis of toxicology and the growing concerns over the adverse effects of drugs, environmental pollution, and occupational hazards.\r\n\r\nPrinciples of Biochemical Toxicology, Fourth Edition thoroughly explains dose-response relationships, disposition and metabolism, and toxic responses to foreign compounds, and presents detailed examples to make the mechanisms of toxicity more accessible to students encountering the subject for the first time. Comprehensive in scope with a clear and concise approach, the text includes summary sections, questions and model answers, and thoroughly revised artwork that serves as an essential aid to learning and teaching.\r\n\r\nNew to the Fourth Edition:\r\n\r\nreorganized sections that cover basic principles followed by sections on different types of toxicity\r\nextensive use of examples throughout and numerous explanatory diagrams\r\nnew material on risk assessment, export systems, oxidative stress, Thalidomide, Tamoxifen and asbestos proliferators, domoic acid, bone marrow (benzene), heart (adriamycin), blood (primaquine), biomarkers, cytochrome P450 and other enzymes, receptor mediated effects, endocrine disruption, ethanol, botox, arsenic, and more\r\nquestions with answers for each chapter for review and self-checking\r\nexpanded and updated chapter bibliographies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c83710c84c6341fd57c812106102ad978ea6c3e","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Biochemical+Toxicology+4th+ed+-+John+A.+Timbrell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c83710c84c6341fd57c812106102ad978ea6c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,131,113,12,132,198,52,31,213,124,129,33,6,16,42,217,120,234,108,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
