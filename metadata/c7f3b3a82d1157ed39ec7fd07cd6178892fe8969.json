Described by one reviewer as Ã¢â‚¬Å“like getting stabbed in the head,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the $6 million film earned a grand total of $1,800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. Now in its tenth anniversary year, The Room is an international phenomenon to rival The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Thousands of fans wait in line for hours to attend screenings complete with costumes, audience rituals, merchandising, and thousands of plastic spoons.\n\nReaders need not have seen The Room to appreciate its costar Greg SesteroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account of how Tommy Wiseau defied every law of artistry, business, and interpersonal relationships to achieve the dream only he could love. While it does unravel mysteries for fans, The Disaster Artist is more than just an hilarious story about cinematic hubris: It is ultimately a surprisingly inspiring tour de force that reads like a page-turning novel, an open-hearted portrait of a supremely enigmatic man who will capture your heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f3b3a82d1157ed39ec7fd07cd6178892fe8969","amp;dn":"The+Disaster+Artist+-+My+Life+Inside+The+Room%2C+the+Greatest+Bad+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f3b3a82d1157ed39ec7fd07cd6178892fe8969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,243,179,168,45,17,87,237,57,236,127,208,124,214,23,136,146,254,137,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
