This method takes advantage of the model-based design approaches as well as the use of formal methods for the validation of these systems. Furthermore, the use of automatic software code generation tools using models makes it possible to reduce the development phase as well as the final solution testing.\n\nThis book presents, firstly, an overview of the model-based design approaches such as those used in the field of aeronautical software engineering. Secondly, an original methodology that is perfectly adapted to the field of aeronautical embedded systems is introduced. Finally, the authors illustrate the use of this method using a case study for the design, implementation and testing of a new generation aeronautical router.\n\n\nPublisher: Wiley-ISTE; 1 edition (October 13, 2014)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00OIZEEIC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7cea7c3667ded392c18a45b19e8dead170d9273","amp;dn":"%5BNicolas+Larrieu+%2C+Antoine+Varet+%28Author%29+%5DRapid+Prototyping+Sof","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7cea7c3667ded392c18a45b19e8dead170d9273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,206,167,195,102,125,237,57,44,24,164,91,25,232,222,173,23,13,146,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
