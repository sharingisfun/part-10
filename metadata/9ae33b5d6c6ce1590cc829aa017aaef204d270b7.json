We never had the chance we deserved to experience ShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nwords as he meant them to be experienced! And we missed out on a literary \nencounter that should have been very, very special.\nBut now you can learn to enjoy and understand ShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½through a \nbrilliantly entertaining course on Shakespeare: The Word and the Action. \nTaught on audio- or videotape in 16 wonderful lectures by one of the \nnationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most honored and popular Shakespeare teachersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Professor Peter \nSaccio of Dartmouth College.\nThe Teaching Company is offering Shakespeare: The Word and the Action \nto introduce you to the special pleasure of learning from a teacher \nof Professor SaccioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique gifts. The course is an excellent companion \nto William Shakespeare: Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies, Professor \nSaccio's other lecture series specifically devoted to Shakespeare.\nTeaching as both a lecturer and a trained actor and director, and assisted \nby two additional Shakespearean actors, Professor Saccio shows us the \nextraordinary ways in which Shakespeare used language, action, and structure \nto create the dramatic impact and deep insight that forever set him \napart.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ae33b5d6c6ce1590cc829aa017aaef204d270b7","amp;dn":"TTC+Shakespeare+-+Word+and+Action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ae33b5d6c6ce1590cc829aa017aaef204d270b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,227,59,93,108,108,225,89,12,200,41,170,1,122,174,242,4,210,112,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
