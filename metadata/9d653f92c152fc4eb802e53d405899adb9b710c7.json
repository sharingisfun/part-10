It bombed so badly in the UK that the follow-up, LIVIN ON THE FAULT LINE, was never released here on LP. There are few traumas in the history of rock music which have led to a band re-inventing itself so successfully.\n\nThe cause was Tom Johnston's departure, a possibility which had been foreseen with the recruitment of third guitarist Jeff Baxter. But Baxter was neither a vocalist nor a volume songwriter. When Johnston finally left, the band was thrown into upheaval. None of them seemed to have a solo career ahead of them, so they had to stick together. But only one track was in the can -- 'Turn It Loose', a leftover from the wonderful STAMPEDE period that hadn't made it onto the album. However much the band's manager might want to thrust Simmons as the band's new leader -- that's why his photo is on the front of this album -- it seems that he needed a co-leader to bring out the best of his glorious writing, singing and guitar playing.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Wheels of fortune                                    [04:58]\n02.Takin' it to the streets                             [04:04]\n03.8th avenue shuffle                                   [04:45]\n04.Losin' end                                           [03:51]\n05.Rio                                                  [03:54]\n06.For someone special                                  [05:13]\n07.It keeps you runnin'                                 [04:28]\n08.Turn it loose                                        [04:00]\n09.Carry me away                                        [04:15]\n________\n39:28 min\n 63,0 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
