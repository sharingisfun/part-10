Producer Beck doesnt clutter the record with unnecessary textures but encourages Malkmus to take detours, so Mirror Traffic winds up playing something like a focused update on Wowee Zowee. Unlike Face the Truth, a similarly kaleidoscopic pop album, there is a casualness here that is immensely appealing.\n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Alternative, Singer/Songwriter\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
