R. K. Iyengar, R. K. Jain, &quot;Numerical Methods&quot;\nNew Age International | 2009 | ISBN: 9788122426106, 9788122427073 | 328 pages | PDF \n\nThis comprehensive textbook covers material for one semester course on Numerical Methods (MA 1251) for B.E./ B.Tech. students of Anna University. The emphasis in the book is on the presentation of fundamentals and theoretical concepts in an intelligible and easy to understand manner. The book is written as a textbook rather than as a problem/guide book. The textbook offers a logical presentation of both the theory and techniques for problem solving to motivate the students in the study and application of Numerical Methods. Examples and Problems in Exercises are used to explain each theoretical concept and application of these concepts in problem solving. Answers for every problem and hints for difficult problems are provided to encourage the students for self-learning. At the end of each important section, a review set of questions and answers are provided to understand the theoretical concepts in the text.\n\nContents:\nSolution of Equations and Eigen Value Problems\nInterpolation and Approximation\nNumerical Differentiation and Integration\nInitial Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations\nBoundary Value Problems in Ordinary Differential Equations and Initial &amp; Boundary Value Problems in Partial Differential Equations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c49d0741bd791dcf8f84bab40b3ddc0bd3010ef","amp;dn":"Numerical+Methods+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c49d0741bd791dcf8f84bab40b3ddc0bd3010ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,73,208,116,27,215,145,220,248,248,75,171,64,179,221,192,189,48,16,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
