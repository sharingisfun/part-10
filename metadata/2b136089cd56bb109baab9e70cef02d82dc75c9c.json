This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's classic novel of the same name. A young lawyer (Jonathan Harker) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of Eastern Europe. He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray. InDracula begins a reign of seduction and terror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy Westenra. Lucy's friends gather together to try to drive Dracula away. \nIt stars Gary Oldman as Count Dracula and Winona Ryder as Mina Harker, also featuring Anthony Hopkins as Professor Abraham Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, and Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra in her first major film role. The film's score was composed by Wojciech Kilar and featured &quot;Love Song for a Vampire&quot; by Annie Lennox as the closing credits theme.\n\nDESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER OF DVD FOLDER:\nBram StokerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dracula follows the tortured journey of the devastatingly seductive Transylvanian Prince as he moves from Eastern Europe to Late 19th Century London, where after centuries alone in his crumbling castle; his taste for humanity has grown bold with desire. Touching that humanity, and having lost his own, this a chronicle of damnation and redemption, of horror and romantic passion, or renunciation and sacrifice.\nDirector Francis Ford CoppolaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision of the story is highly stylized and yet remains uncommonly true to the source material. He has approached the frequently told narrative in a way that is truly unique. Emphasizing the human emotion behind the most terrifying aspects of the story and employing in-the-camera special effects in the manner used in 1900 by the early magicians of the cinema, Coppola has orchestrated a fresh and provocative presentation of a story which has seen numerous screen versions.\n\nCAST: \n-Gary Oldman as Count Dracula / Vlad III the Impaler\n-Winona Ryder as Mina Harker (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Murray) / Elisabeta\n-Anthony Hopkins as Professor Abraham Van Helsing / Priest\n-Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker\n-Richard E.
