This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses ModelÃ¢â‚¬â€œviewÃ¢â‚¬â€œcontroller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps.\n\nGuided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll walk through the frameworkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key features, and then build a working AngularJS appÃ¢â‚¬â€from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app.\n\nDive deep into AngularÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s building blocks and learn how they work together\nGain maximum flexibility by separating logic, data, and presentation responsibilities with MVC\nAssemble your full app in the browser, using client-side templates\nUse AngularJS directives to extend HTML with declarative syntax\nCommunicate with the server and implement simple caching with the $http service\nUse dependency injection to improve refactoring, testability, and multiple environment design\nGet code samples for common problems you face in most web apps.\n\n\n\nRegards,\nMasum. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/masum2444/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/masum2444/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4835cad3a45b53d86453f7e2398f61829c591aa6","amp;dn":"O%27REILLY+-+AngularJS+by+Brad+Green+%5BApril%2C2013%5D%5Bmasum2444%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4835cad3a45b53d86453f7e2398f61829c591aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,53,202,211,164,91,83,216,100,83,247,226,57,143,97,130,156,89,26,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
