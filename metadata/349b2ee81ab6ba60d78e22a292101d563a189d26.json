Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nThe official description below doesn't do this book justice. It's essentially a beautifully written introduction to the Orthodox way of seeing the world and living in it. The best first book to read on Orthodox Christianity for anyone unfamiliar with it.\n\ndescription:\n\nThis book is a general account of the doctrine, worship and life of Orthodox Christians by the author of the now classic The Orthodox Church. It raises the basic issues of theology: God is hidden yet revealed; the problem with evil; the nature of salvation; the meaning of faith; prayer; death and what lies beyond. In so doing, it helps to fill the need for modern Orthodox catechism. Yet this book is not a mere manual, a dry-as-dust repository of information. Throughout the book, Bishop Kallistos Ware shows the meaning of Orthodox doctrine for the life of the individual Christian. Doctrinal issues are seen not as abstract propositions for theological debate but as affecting the whole of life. A wealth of texts drawn from theologians and spiritual writers of all ages accompanies Bishop Kallistos' presentation. They, too, reveal Orthodoxy not just as a system of beliefs, practices and customs but indeed as the Way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:349b2ee81ab6ba60d78e22a292101d563a189d26","amp;dn":"Kallistos+Ware+-+The+Orthodox+Way+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"349b2ee81ab6ba60d78e22a292101d563a189d26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,155,46,232,26,182,186,96,215,142,34,162,146,16,29,86,58,24,157,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
