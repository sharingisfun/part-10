Bennett, a self-taught woodworker who hopes to encourage beginners, here offers a collection of 20 projects appropriate for woodworkers of every skill level. This reviewer has not been so excited about a new project book in years; the designs are beautiful and so diverse that they should appeal to nearly everyone. Projects include appliqu knots and borders, a Claddach love spoon, a hand mirror, an eagle wall plaque, picture frames, boxes, coasters, a mirrored candle sconce, and a standing Celtic cross (this reviewer's current project). Several projects successfully combine multiple materials, including scroll-sawn brass or stained glass. Each project includes excellent step-by-step instructions, profuse color photos, and a pattern. This title is a pleasure to read and, more important, to work from and should be included in every public library collection.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:957f677c2221885a1ccf1a098b2ec2409ab9ccbe","amp;dn":"Celtic+Woodcraft+-+Authentic+Projects+for+Woodworkers+-+%28Malestr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"957f677c2221885a1ccf1a098b2ec2409ab9ccbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,127,103,124,34,33,136,90,28,207,26,9,139,46,194,64,154,185,204,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
