Well, this WTF - inspiring comic takes the cake. Comic Book \nResources recently recommended this old and rare comic. After finding it\nand reading it I was left thinking ... WTH did I just read?? **\n\nFrom CBRs Recommendation:\n\nThe New Adventures of Hitler\n\nLest you think that title is some sort of ironic joke or that the book doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t \nactually involve the person mentioned in the title, much in the same way JoyceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nUlysses isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t about the Greek hero (at least not on the surface) let me assure \nyou, this is a comic book about the Adolf Hiter.\n\nMorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story is based on a (extremely dubious) claim made by Adolf HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nsister-in-law Bridget Dowling that the future leader of the Third Reich had \nlived with her, her husband, Alois, and their young son in Liverpool, England, \nfor a brief time between 1912 and 1913. MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story runs with that \npremise and imagines a shiftless and down on his luck Adolf roaming through \nthe Liverpool streets, consulting with fortune tellers and generally \nembarrassing his family, who consider him a slacker doomed to forever \nsponge off relatives while dreaming of grandeur.\n\nNow, lest you have any fears at this point that Morrison portrays Hitler \nin anything resembling a sympathetic manner, allow me to put them to rest. \nThe Hitler portrayed here is little more than a hallucinating (early on in \nthe story he opens his closet to find Morrissey there singing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeaven Knows \nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½m Miserable NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) madman and buffoon, albeit a dangerous one since, for \nall his bizarre behavior and paranoia, he quickly grows to understand how \nto best exploit peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basic needs and fears in order to serve his own \nmania for power and make the world fit his view of how things should be. \nNo, this story is not some awkward attempt to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunderstandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the most hated \nman in the world but more of a warning to modern readers about how Hitler \nwas one man in a long line of certain types of people are always ready to \ntake advantage of the rest of us if we allow them to\n\n** Scan quality isnt the best on this oldy **\n\n?Enjoy? and Please SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2742f9bcd17fd689b54397ae89a8d47446299771","amp;dn":"The+New+Adventures+of+Hitler+%5BRARE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2742f9bcd17fd689b54397ae89a8d47446299771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,66,249,188,209,127,214,137,181,67,151,174,137,168,212,116,70,41,151,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
