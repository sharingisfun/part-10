However, some have been all new content, not released before in novel format. The series, like the novels they are based on, are set in a future where mankind is facing annihilation by an aggressive alien society, an insect-like race known colloquially as &quot;Buggers&quot; but more formally as &quot;Formics.&quot; The central character, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, is one of the child soldiers trained at Battle School (and eventually Command School) to be the future leaders of the protection of Earth. The year is never specified, although the ages of the Wiggin children are specified to change throughout space, also carefully taking in the relativity of space and time.\n\n\nAlternate reading order - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game_(comics)#Chronological_order_of_series\n\nIf You have downloaded my previous Enders Game torrent saving this torrent to the same file location should allow your torrent program to recognize the files, speeding up the the download for yourself and others \n\nFiles include what alternate covers I could find\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game_(comics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game_(comics)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://io9.com/5029258/this-is-what-enders-game-will-look-like-from-now-on&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://io9.com/5029258/this-is-what-enders-game-will-look-like-from-now-on&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\n00 - Gold Bug (from Red Prophet The Tales of Alvin Maker Vol. 1 HC)\n01 - Ender's Game - Battle School\n02 - Ender's Shadow - Battle School\n03 - Ender's Game - Recruiting Valentine\n04 - Ender's Game - Command School\n05 - Ender's Shadow - Command School\n06 - Ender's Game - War of Gifts\t\n07 - Ender's Game - Mazer in Prison\n08 - Ender's Game - The League War\n09 - Ender In Exile\n10 - Speaker For The Dead\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\n12 - Formic Wars - Silent Strike\nEnder's Game Sketchbook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e874f2c953607be0e026f5049d74cc39cdcf482","amp;dn":"Ender%27s+Game+%28up-todate%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e874f2c953607be0e026f5049d74cc39cdcf482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,135,79,44,149,54,7,190,14,2,111,80,73,215,76,195,156,220,244,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
