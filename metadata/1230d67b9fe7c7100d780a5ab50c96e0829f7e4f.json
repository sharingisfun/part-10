For the past 130 years, the quest to produce a perfect Ring has stymied directors, including Wagner himself, who struggled to meet the immense theatrical demands of his own creation. The cosmic vision of gods and mortals vying for power and destroyed by greed calls for astonishing stage visuals of fire storms, flying warriors, and underwater and heavenly actions.\nread-more-btn\ninterview with film director, Susan Froemke\n\nSusan Froemke and Bob EisenhardtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new documentary, WagnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream, centers on director Robert Lepage and soprano Deborah Voigt as they prepare for the greatest operatic challenge of their lives: the composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s epic Ring cycle. But as the filmmakers tell the MetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Matt Dobkin, the real stars of the show may be the stage Ã¢â‚¬Å“machineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the technical teams that worked tirelessly to tame it.\nread-more-btn\ninterview with ring cycle director, Robert lepage\n\nAfter six years of tireless effort, the Met presents its first new production of WagnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complete Ring cycle in more than 20 years. Director Robert Lepage discusses operaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supreme challenge.\n\n\nmy notes\n\n  As in a previous torrent I have going called &quot;Wonders Are Many; The Making of Doctor Atomic,&quot; this film is about how opera is made.  It is about the stagecraft entailed in making Wagner's The Ring Cycle at the Metropolitan Opera.  You will see stage architecture and the engineering required to build a theatrical set like no other.\nThe closest I can get to describing the design concept (which I first saw in The Architectural Record; the  monthly magazine of the AIA) is the work of Santiago Calatrava.  The movement shown in The Ring &quot;machine&quot; reminded me ofthe Briese Soliel which Calatrava designed for the Milwaukee Museum of Art.\n\nCaptured here in small size and with hard subtitles for French and German segments I present it for those who would have their libraries stock the full package of dvd and booklet.  It serves as an inspiration of the stagecraft yet to be created by the new designers of the future.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1230d67b9fe7c7100d780a5ab50c96e0829f7e4f","amp;dn":"Wagner%27s+Dream%3A+a+documentary+of+the+making+of+The+Ring+at+the+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1230d67b9fe7c7100d780a5ab50c96e0829f7e4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,48,214,123,159,231,199,16,13,120,10,90,181,12,150,224,130,159,126,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
