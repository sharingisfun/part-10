In this book, the author attempts to answer the question &quot;is self-sufficiency really possible on one acre of land?&quot; by reflecting on her own journey and her family's one acre homestead design.\n\nShe considers the notion of self-sufficiency in terms financial independence and sustainable food production, boldly urging readers to reconsider their perspectives about the economy, take back their workday and put their energy to use by increasing the value of their own households. One-Acre Homestead features a simplified permaculture design for a one acre farm that produces the majority of the resident's food. Instead of investing in expensive livestock, the author recommends that homesteaders raise poultry, practice forest gardening and grow trees for biomass production in order to practice a no-till, sustainable gardening system. She claims that the homestead doesn't have to provide 100% of everything a family uses, but gardening zones should be established so that production can be maximized to meet the majority of a family's food needs in a crisis year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec3e05e06998878484f8d722c84338130d997ae","amp;dn":"One+Acre+Homestead+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec3e05e06998878484f8d722c84338130d997ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,195,224,94,6,153,136,120,72,79,141,114,44,132,51,129,48,217,151,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
