In fact, while reviewing the Ã¢â‚¬Å“testsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ five years later in 1958, one CIA auditor wrote: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Precautions must be taken not only to protect operations from exposure to enemy forces, but also to conceal these activities from the American public. The knowledge the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activities would have serious repercussions in political and diplomatic circles.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Most of the documents detailing day-to-day operations within MKULTRA were destroyed by the CIA in 1972. These included limitless LSD experiments on unknowing victims, as well as experiments with sensory deprivation, electro-shock, brain implants, hypnosis and various forms of torture.\n\nAmong those involved in MKULTRA workings were former Nazi scientists. Project Paperclip was the codename for the U.S. Intelligence Services and military project that brought hundreds of Nazi scientists specializing in chemical weapons, science, rocketry and medicine from Germany to the U.S. directly after the collapse of the Nazi government during the end of WWII. Without State Department approval, more than 800 ardent Nazi supporters and their families were brought to the United States. I detailed this in a commentary entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Project Paperclip: Nazis in America.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These Nazi scientists worked in the fields of medicine, science, mind control and advanced weaponry. However, not one of them actually qualified for work visas since they had all recently served to further HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Third Reich. Their work on guided and ballistic missile technology later resulted in the founding of NASA.\n\nDespite then-President Harry S. TrumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orders not to allow scientists who were thought to have Ã¢â‚¬Å“unusually strongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ leanings toward Nazi propaganda, many of the incoming German scientistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ files were rewritten and Ã¢â‚¬Å“cleaned-up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This was mainly to prevent their expert skills from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. As the men were being siphoned out by government officialsÃ¢â‚¬â€those who would come to the U.S. and those who would notÃ¢â‚¬â€selected scientistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (whose files were then creatively edited) paperwork was earmarked with a large paperclip. Hence, the beginning of the notorious Ã¢â‚¬Å“Project Paperclip.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Most of the information still surrounding Project Paperclip remains classified to this day. This includes the whereabouts of Dr. Josef Mengele, the most disturbing of all Nazi medical doctors known for his compulsive attraction to human experimentation. \n\nDirectly following the expatriation of Nazi scientists into the U.S.Ã¢â‚¬â€under the guise of the newly created project MKULTRA, officially defined as Ã¢â‚¬Å“A CIA Program of Research in Behavioral ModificationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Project BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE were formed in the early 1950s. These served as the primary codenames for a massive mind-control campaignÃ¢â‚¬â€a field many Nazi scientists were specialists in long before the onslaught of WWII.\n\nAll the subprograms of MKULTRA, including Bluebird and Artichoke, coupled with the expatriation of hundreds of Nazi scientists specializing in mind control experiments, were justified by the CIA as a necessary means to an endÃ¢â‚¬â€that is, to create dissociative symptoms and disorders, including full multiple personality disorder, for the creation of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Manchurian candidates,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or super-spies to be used on enemies during the Cold War.\n\nIn 2001, Carol Rutz published a brief narrative of her life that would shock all those who read it. A Nation Betrayed: The Chilling True Story of Secret Cold War Experiments on Our Children and Other Innocent People is an alarming account of U.S. government experiments performed on innocent children under the guise of preparing the country for a Cold War that would never happenÃ¢â‚¬â€with many government officials heralding the project as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the end that would justify the means.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nUsing electroshock, drugs, hypnosis, trauma and sensory deprivation, thousands of American children such as Carol Rutz allegedly endured unthinkable mental and physical pain at the hands of the CIA conducting mind experiments in order to create a Manchurian Candidate. But as our country began to lift the veil of Cold War paranoia, these same children, according to Rutz, were now growing into adults, and suddenly they began silently suffering flashes of torturous memories that neither they nor those around them understood. Indeed, for these Americans, including Rutz, the damage stemming from the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s misuse of power during this time period had already been done.\n\nIn an effort to expose the truth about these government experiments, RutzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Nation BetrayedÃ¢â‚¬â€now being adapted into a motion picture screenplayÃ¢â‚¬â€is footnoted documentation of her personal involvement in mind control experiments beginning when she was four years old. Sold to the government for use by her father and grandfather, RutzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account includes her 12-year frightening journey of government testing and training for use in various ways, including everything from sexual acts to assassinations by mentally creating Ã¢â‚¬Å“altersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in herÃ¢â‚¬â€or multiple personalities. Under American government programs such as Bluebird/Artichoke and MKULTRA, CIA personnel worked alongside former Nazi scientists and doctors who had already proven proficient in breaking the mind and rebuilding it.\n\nReview from amazon:\n\nBy Eleanor White on June 8, 2010\n\n&quot;Carol Rutz' &quot;A Nation Betrayed&quot; should be required reading for high school juniors or seniors.\n\nToday's citizens need to know how crucially important it is that citizens exercise their sovereign responsibilities and keep government on a very short leash. When citizens &quot;leave important things to the best qualified,&quot; you get situations like the brutal MKULTRA torture of children, described in detail by Carol Rutz, who survived this horror story.\n\nNEVER trust government platitudes. Demand transparency and accountability. Don't be fooled by pleasing personalities who look good on camera. I'm not recommending a witch hunt, just straightforward alertness, with stories like Carol's in the back of your mind. The &quot;national security&quot; excuse covered up Carol's torture and those of other MKULTRA era experimentees.\n\nReading this book is an excellent first step in restoring the power of government to those who rightly own it - the people!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c36bd4462a57fa21216cfff2dc011caf34ea3a","amp;dn":"Carol+Rutz+-+A+Nation+Betrayed%28The+Chilling+True+Story+of+Secret","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c36bd4462a57fa21216cfff2dc011caf34ea3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,195,107,212,70,42,87,250,33,33,108,255,242,220,1,28,175,52,234,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
