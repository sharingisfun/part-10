The film first aired in 1973. In the movie, demonic forces terrorize the passengers on a Boeing 747 en route from London to New York.\n\nWilliam Shatner, who 10 years earlier had starred in the Twilight Zone episode &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,&quot; plays the lead role. Shatner described his character's demise in the movie as one of his &quot;unique ways&quot; of dying: &quot;I get sucked out of an airplane while carrying a lit torch into the plane's baggage compartment to try to confront a druid ghost.&quot; According to Shatner, many of his fans consider the movie the worst Shatner movie ever.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Chuck Connors - Captain Ernie Slade\n    Buddy Ebsen - Glenn Farlee\n    William Shatner - Paul Kovalik\n    Roy Thinnes - Alan O'Neill\n    Jane Merrow - Sheila O'Neill\n    Tammy Grimes - Mrs. Pinder\n    Lynn Loring - Manya\n    Paul Winfield - Dr. Enkalla\n    France Nuyen - Annalik\n    Will Hutchins - Steve Holcomb\n    Darleen Carr - Margot\n    Russell Johnson - Jim Hawley\n    H.M.

Also aboard the flight are Buddy Ebsen as a pushy millionaire, William Shatner as a drunken, cynical ex-priest, Tammy Grimes as a nutcase, and Chuck Connors as the lantern-jawed pilot. Crew and passengers come into jeopardy when an invisible demon escapes from the altar, and threatens the plane in an effort to destroy the architect's wife. No, it doesn't make any sense, but it's pretty hilarious, and you should watch it anyway\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 8795 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 74 mins\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84494948b98e2aab561298598c50aad9d99a7206","amp;dn":"The+Horror+at+37%2C000+feet+%281973%29+DVD5+Untouched+-+William+Shatne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84494948b98e2aab561298598c50aad9d99a7206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,73,73,72,185,142,42,171,86,18,152,89,140,80,170,217,217,154,114,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
