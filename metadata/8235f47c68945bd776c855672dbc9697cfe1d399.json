Moorman\n\nCheck out the video on Youtube titled &quot;Early Manuscript Evidence For The KJV&quot; for a brief preview of the book.\n\n The Fundamentalist Christian world is deeply divided as to the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek Words of the Bible. A large and vocal segment of the Fundamentalist world has denied that God even Ã¢â‚¬Å“promisedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to preserve these Words. Because of this, they also deny that He has in fact preserved these Words to this day.\n In articles, speeches, books, or in other ways, many leading Bible schools, seminaries and their representatives have held this false position. Surprisingly, several Fundamentalist schools have adopted this false view, and teach it in their classrooms. This false position must be countered by the significant evidence found in this volume.\n Dr. Moorman has adduced sound and clear evidence that the Words underlying our King James Bible have been preserved by the Lord from the earliest of apostolic times. It is hoped that open-minded Christians will buy this book, read it, be convinced of its veracity, and urge many of their fellow-Fundamentalists and others to change their views on this subject.\nWe urge you to make the book available to Pastors, teachers, seminary students, colleges, seminaries, universities, and Christians of all walks of life. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you freeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (John 8:32).\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Dr. Jack A. Moorman (1941- ) has written six books and a number of articles in defense of the King James Bible.\nHe graduated from Tennessee Temple Bible College in the 1960s and traveled to South Africa to begin a missionary church-planting ministry. He was there from 1968-88, counting two years he lived in England during that time. They started five churches, a Bible Institute, and a tract printing ministry. In 1988 they moved to England, and since  November 1993, he has preached in London, and carried on a tract ministry to more than fifty market areas across the city. It was during his years in South Africa that he began an earnest examination of the Bible version issue.\n His book, Forever Settled, was one of his first volumes. He used it to teach his students at a Bible College in South Africa where he served the Lord as a missionary before going to England. He is member of the an Executive Committee of the Dean Burgon Society.\n\nDr. Moorman has written the following scholarly books defending the King James Bible and the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek Words that underlie it:\n1. Early Manuscripts, Church Fathers, and the Authorized Version (the present volume).\n2. Forever Settled.\n3. When the King James Bible Departs from the So-Called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Majority Text\n4. Missing in Modern BiblesÃ¢â‚¬â€the Nestle-Aland Greek Text &amp; New International Version Errors.\n5. The Doctrinal Heart o f the BibleÃ¢â‚¬â€Removed form Modern Versions.\n6.

TregellesÃ¢â‚¬â€The Man Who Made the Critical Text Acceptable to Bible Believers.\n8. 8,000 Differences Between the Textus Receptus and the Critical Text.\nAll of these scholarly and well-documented works by Dr. Moorman are replete with manuscript and other evidence which he has gleaned from his own vast resources as well as all the references found in the British Museum and other libraries in the London area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8235f47c68945bd776c855672dbc9697cfe1d399","amp;dn":"Early+Manuscripts%2C+Church+Fathers%2C+And+The+Authorized+Version+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8235f47c68945bd776c855672dbc9697cfe1d399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,53,244,124,104,148,91,215,118,200,85,103,45,188,150,151,207,225,211,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
