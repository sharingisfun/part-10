Many of his pieces include a map and story in the CD case, almost all of them having a fantasy theme to them. The music itself is primarily instrumental in nature, with some vocalizations by Arkenstone and others. It has recently been described as &quot;Cinematic New Age Rock&quot; by some. He cites World Music, New Age, classical music, and rock music as his major influences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9fc00c3ae98ba27f2ce4dda49347ebbd26732c6","amp;dn":"David+Arkenstone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9fc00c3ae98ba27f2ce4dda49347ebbd26732c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,252,0,195,174,152,186,39,242,206,77,218,73,52,126,187,210,103,50,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
