Blood Sympathy (1993) [8 hours, CD] Read by Simon Williamson (Thanks to Bookywoody for this new copy)\nPI can mean many things, but can it really mean a balding, middle-aged redundant lathe operator from a high rise in Luton, (near London)? Joe Sixsmith thinks it can. His Aunt Mirabelle thinks you'd have to be crazy to hire him, and Joe's current clients certainly fit the bill. One seems to be confessing to the brutal murder of his whole family; another thinks she's a witch. Alongside them, the two heavies who believe Joe is hiding their illicit drugs seem almost normal. In the past Reginald Hill has brought wit, style and compassion to police investigation. Now he does the same for the private sector, and -- in perhaps his greatest feat of creation -- reinvents Luton in the process.\n\n#2. Born Guilty (1995) [7 Hours 33 mins, Cassettes] Read by Simon Williamson\nHurrying out of St Monkey's church on the last Amen of the Creation, Joe Sixsmith stumbles across a boy's corpse in a cardboard box and into more trouble than he's ever known. Soon his casebook is full to bursting: retired colonial Mrs C. demands to know how the boy got there; Gallie, the Mutant from Outer Space, urges him to find the stranger nosing into her granddad's past; while Butcher, that briefest of briefs, is hellbent on digging the dirt on a deputy head's out-of-school activities. Ever valiant for truth, Joe threads his mild-mannered way through the mean streets of Luton, fighting off angry cops, demented druggies and the matchmaking machinations of his Auntie Mirabelle. But the truth he discovers does not set him free, for there's little joy in confirming that today's kids grow up so much faster than he did, and even the luckiest of them find out all too soon that they have been born guilty.\n\n#3. Killing The Lawyers (1997) [10 hours 22 mins, Cassettes] Read by Simon Williamson\nPrivate Investigator Joe Sixsmith is irate that his automobile insurance company could so devalue his wrecked car. Joe visits his lawyer, who tells him to go to a specialist in motor insurance cases. Joe travels to the posh law firm of Poll-Pott only to be accosted by a female attorney and treated like dirt by a contemptuous lawyer, Peter Potter. A disgusted Joe leaves the law firm, shouting nasty epithets at the lawyers. Later that day, Peter is found murdered and initially Joe is a suspect because he had the motive, the means, and perhaps the opportunity. However, because of the means (a broken neck twisted by an expert), the police realize Joe could not have committed the crime. Meanwhile, Joe is hired to check into threats aimed at an internationally famous athlete. However, when another Poll-Pott lawyer is murdered, another partner in the firm hires Joe to investigate the killings. Suddenly, Joe, not noted for his ambition, has two headline cases to investigate.(HK)\n\n#4. Singing The Sadness (1999) [9 hours 38 mins, CD] Read by Christian Rodska\nPrivate Investigator Joe Sixsmith looks forward to singing along with his fellow church choir members at a Welsh festival. On the way to Llanffugiol, Joe and his bus mates see a burning summer cottage. Joe rushes inside to save a trapped person. Joe is slightly hurt from his daring do and will miss the competition. However, the individual he rescued suffers much greater injuries. No one local or form the bus knows who she is or why she was in Copa Cottage. The cottage owners, Fran and Franny Haggard arrive from Islington, denying they know the victim. Fran hires Joe to learn the identity of the injured party. Franny also employs Joe to learn if the victim was her spouse's mistress. As Joe begins his inquiries, he quickly realizes that several other people have vested interests in his investigation way beyond just a natural curiosity. As he digs deeper, he begins to uncover crimes from years ago that someone wants to remain secret, even at the cost of Joe's life. (HK)\n\n#5. The Roar of the Butterflies (2010) [8 hours, CD] Read by Rupert Farley\nLuton in the grip of a sweltering summer is a pretty sedentary place - which is bad for the private detective business. Thieves, fraudsters and philanderers take the month off and the only swingers in town are the ones to be found on the 19th hole of the Royal Hoo Golf Course. The civilized reputation of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“HooÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is in trouble, however. Shocking allegations of cheating have been directed at one of its leading members, Chris Porphyry. When Chris turns to Joe Sixsmith, PI, he's more than willing to help. . .well, he hasn't got any other clientsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦only Joe hadn't counted on being charmed, kissed and then dangled out of a window all in the same day! Before long, though, Joe is on the trail of a conspiracy that starts with missing balls, and ends with murder...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/13/reginald-hill&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/13/reginald-hill&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f02b749322c99ac7998da2fbb7d8e8d5c038722a","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Joe+Sixsmith+Mystery+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f02b749322c99ac7998da2fbb7d8e8d5c038722a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,43,116,147,34,201,154,199,153,141,162,251,183,216,232,213,192,56,114,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
