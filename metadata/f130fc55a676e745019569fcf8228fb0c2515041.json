Gifford was himself replaced by Bones Hillman in 1987.[2][3][5] Through a long and distinguished career, the band became known for its driving hard-rock sound, intense live performances and political activism, particularly in aid of anti-nuclear, environmentalist and indigenous causes.[7]\n\nMidnight Oil's albums which peaked in the Australian Top Ten were 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Red Sails in the Sunset, Species Deceases, Diesel and Dust, Blue Sky Mining, Scream in Blue (Live), Earth and Sun and Moon, Breathe, 20,000 Watt R.S.L., Redneck Wonderland, The Real Thing, Capricornia and Flat Chat.[8][9] Australian Top Ten singles were &quot;Power and the Passion&quot;, &quot;The Dead Heart&quot;, &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; and &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot;.[8][9] Aside from chart success, both &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; and &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; were listed by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in the Top 30 best Australian songs of all time in 2001,[10] a chart in which Midnight Oil are the only artists to feature twice. In December 2002, Garrett announced that he would seek to further his political career and Midnight Oil disbanded. But they would reform for two warm-up shows in Canberra leading up to their performance at one of the &quot;Sound Relief&quot; charity concerts, in honour of the victims of the 2009 &quot;Black Saturday&quot; fires in Victoria and floods in Queensland.\n\nMidnight Oil won eleven Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards during its career,[11] including induction into the Hall of Fame in 2006.[12][13] At the induction, ARIA chairman Denis Handlin described Midnight Oil as true legends that always led by example in a uniquely Australian way with music that is powerful, uncompromising, inspiring, entertaining and enduring.[6]\n\nIn 2010, their album Diesel and Dust ranked no. 1 in the book The 100 Best Australian Albums by Toby Creswell, Craig Mathieson and John O'Donnell. \n\n\n\n\n\n20,000 Watt R.S.L. is a compilation album by Australian rock band Midnight Oil released in October 1997 on their own label Sprint Music.[2][3] The word &quot;Collection&quot; appears on the front of the CD along the hinge in the same type face as the title and the name of the band and may have been intended as part of the album's title; however, it does not appear on the spine. The release has also been distributed inside a cardboard sleeve which adds &quot;Midnight Oil: The Hits&quot; to the album art, distinguishing it as a compilation album.\n\nThe compilation covers the majority of Midnight Oil's career, starting with their 1979 album Head Injuries, and includes tracks from all their major studio releases (and one EP), even including two songs from Redneck Wonderland, which was released after the compilation in 1998.[3]\n\nThe album peaked at #1 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) album charts,[4] and achieved 4Ãƒâ€”Platinum sales,[5] it also peaked at #18 in New Zealand.[6] The R.S.L. in the title refers to the Returned and Services League of Australia\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n01. &quot;What Goes On&quot; (Midnight Oil) (from Redneck Wonderland, 1998) \n02. &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; (Rob Hirst, Jim Moginie, Peter Garrett) (from 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1982) \n03. &quot;Dreamworld&quot; (Midnight Oil) (from Diesel and Dust, 1987) \n04. &quot;White Skin Black Heart&quot; (Midnight Oil) (from Redneck Wonderland, 1998) \n05. &quot;Kosciuszko&quot; (Hirst, Moginie) (from Red Sails in the Sunset, 1984) \n06. &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; (Midnight Oil) (from Diesel and Dust, 1987) \n07. &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot; (Midnight Oil) (from Blue Sky Mining, 1990) \n08. &quot;US Forces&quot; (Moginie, Garrett) (from 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1982) \n09. &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; (Midnight Oil) (from Diesel and Dust, 1987) \n10. &quot;One Country&quot; (Moginie/Garrett) (from Blue Sky Mining, 1990) \n11. &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; (Hirst, Moginie) (from Red Sails in the Sunset, 1984) \n12. &quot;Truganini&quot; (Hirst, Moginie) (from Earth and Sun and Moon, 1993) \n13. &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; (Hirst, Moginie) (from Blue Sky Mining, 1990) \n14. &quot;Hercules&quot; (Moginie, Garrett, Hirst) (from Species Deceases, 1986) \n15. &quot;Surf's up Tonight&quot; (Midnight Oil) - from Breathe, 1996) \n16. &quot;Back on the Borderline&quot; (Andrew James, Garrett, Hirst) (from Head Injuries, 1979) \n17. &quot;Don't Wanna Be the One&quot; (Hirst, Garrett, Martin Rotsey, Moginie) (from Place without a Postcard, 1981) \n18. &quot;Forgotten Years&quot; (Hirst, Moginie) (from Blue Sky Mining, 1990) \n\n\n\nEnjoy The Oils :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f130fc55a676e745019569fcf8228fb0c2515041","amp;dn":"Midnight+Oil+-+20000+Watt+RSL+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f130fc55a676e745019569fcf8228fb0c2515041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,48,252,85,166,118,231,69,1,149,105,252,248,34,143,176,194,81,80,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
