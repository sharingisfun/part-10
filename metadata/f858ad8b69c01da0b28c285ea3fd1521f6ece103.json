What sets this collection apart from the other numerous &amp;#039;best of&amp;#039; collections is its presentation. Re-engineered in DSD and mastered by the legendary Bob Ludwig of Gateway Mastering, this SA-CD provides the extraordinary clarity that is a hallmark of DSD.\n\n13 of the 22 songs are Mono recordings with the rest are in Stereo. While the Mono recordings are well done, the Stereo truly shines on these inclusions. Listen to &quot;San Franciscan Nights&quot; and you&amp;#039;ll be amazed at the depth and richness of the instruments and vocals. The many sound textures of &quot;Spill the Wine&quot; also shows off the DSD effect. As a collection, this covers a lot of ground; not only in the fairly broad scope of the songs included here but also in how it is played back. Of course, you&amp;#039;ll need SA-CD capable players to gain the full advantage of this album, however, the hybrid aspect of this CD allows you to play this disc in any CD player. When you acquire an SA-CD player, the disc becomes a bonus in that it becomes re-invented, sound wise. You&amp;#039;ll gain a better appreciation not only of the music of The Animals but also of the latest technology used to convey it. Fans cannot go wrong with this SA-CD.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f858ad8b69c01da0b28c285ea3fd1521f6ece103","amp;dn":"The+Animals+-+Retrospective+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f858ad8b69c01da0b28c285ea3fd1521f6ece103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,88,173,139,105,192,29,160,178,140,40,94,163,253,21,33,246,236,225,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
