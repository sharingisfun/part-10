The band were well into their stride, they were the highest selling artist in the US in 1973 and were enjoying the rewards and the lifestyle that went with it.\nAnyway, Deep Purple co-headlined with ELP. The show has gone down as their most infamous largely due to Ritchie's attempt to burn his hair off. It has been available on video for ages now.\nThe new Sonic Zoom edition is taken direct from the audio track of the pristine 2&quot; video masters, unearthed in 2002. Although there remain some balance problems (the guitar is a little too far back in the mix at the start), it is a far better recording, and with digital mastering and restoration, the end result is also much louder and clearer than the previous edition. Not only is the sound improved but we also get to hear a 'new' track for the very first time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:007abed447fceec94fb6a1855dcee49e83db5447","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Just+Might+Take+Your+Life+%281974%3B+2003%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"007abed447fceec94fb6a1855dcee49e83db5447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,122,190,212,71,252,238,201,79,182,161,133,93,206,228,158,131,219,84,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
