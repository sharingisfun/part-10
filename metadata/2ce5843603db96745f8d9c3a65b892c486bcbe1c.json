Build a house, a fort, even a castle, and people will move in\n to live there and perhaps even sell you different wares to assist you on your\n journey. But beware, there are even more challenges awaiting you... Are you\n up to the task?\n \n INSTALLATION\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Extract the ZIP archive and PLAY! IF the game crashes, \n install dotNetFx40 (depending of your system) and xnafx40_redist\n \n OTHER NOTES\n ~~~~~~~~~~~\n Support the developers. \n IF YOU LIKE THE GAME, BUY IT! \n It's CHEAP, boys!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce5843603db96745f8d9c3a65b892c486bcbe1c","amp;dn":"Terraria+1.2.0.1+%5BSVPTEAM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce5843603db96745f8d9c3a65b892c486bcbe1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,229,132,54,3,219,150,116,95,141,156,58,101,184,146,196,134,188,190,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
