Death Dealer is a new, unexpurgated translation of HÃƒÂ¶ssÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s autobiography, written before, during, and after his trial. This edition includes rare photos, the minutes of the Wannsee Conference (where the Final Solution was decided and coordinated), original diagrams of the camps, a detailed chronology of important events at Auschwitz-Birkenau, HÃƒÂ¶ss's final letters to his family, and a new foreword by Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi. Death Dealer stands as one of the most importantÃ¢â‚¬â€and chillingÃ¢â‚¬â€documents of the Holocaust.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nObersturmbannfÃƒÂ¼hrer Rudolf Franz Ferdinand HÃƒÂ¶ss (also HÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÅ¸, HoeÃƒÅ¸ or Hoess) (25 November 1901 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 16 April 1947) was a Nazi lieutenant colonel in the Schutzstaffel (SS) and the longest serving commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp in World War II. He tested and carried into effect various methods to accelerate Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jewish population of Nazi-occupied Europe through genocide known as the Final Solution. HÃƒÂ¶ss introduced pesticide Zyklon B containing hydrogen cyanide to the killing process, thereby allowing soldiers at Auschwitz to murder 2,000 people every hour. He created the largest installation for the continuous annihilation of human beings ever known.\n\nHÃƒÂ¶ss joined the Nazi Party in 1922 and the SS in 1934. From 4 May 1940 to November 1943, and again from 8 May 1944 to 18 January 1945 he was in charge of Auschwitz where more than a million people were killed before the defeat of Germany. He was hanged in 1947 following a trial in Warsaw","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd59bdc5ed06609c9d4fe27c55e37df28ae72a7d","amp;dn":"Death+Dealer+-+Rudolf+Hoess","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd59bdc5ed06609c9d4fe27c55e37df28ae72a7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,89,189,197,237,6,96,156,157,79,226,124,85,227,125,242,138,231,42,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
