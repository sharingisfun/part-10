This is a rich and vibrant collection that captures the poetry and excitement of communicating scientific understanding and scientific effort from 1900 to the present day. Professor Dawkins has included writing from a diverse range of scientists, some of whom need no introduction, and some of whose works have become modern classics, while others may be less familiar - but all convey the passion of great scientists writing about their science.\n\nEbook, PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8c7e672d5c32f16d83981b4b4df33b30f6c2ab0","amp;dn":"Richard+Dawkins%3A+The+Oxford+Book+of+Modern+Science+Writing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8c7e672d5c32f16d83981b4b4df33b30f6c2ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,199,230,114,213,195,47,22,216,57,129,180,180,223,51,179,15,108,42,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
