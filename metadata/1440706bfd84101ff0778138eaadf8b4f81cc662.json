His latest discovery, Portland, OR-based psych-rock quintet Morning Teleportation, adds to his record with their debut album, Expanding Anyway, out March 8 via Brock's Glacial Pace Recordings. Listen to the entire LP below, exclusively via SPIN.com.\n\nWith their high-energy live performances and eclectic sound (banjo, talkbox, synthesizer, trumpet, theremin), the band built blogosphere buzz and rocked summer festivals including Bonnaroo. Their LP captures their essence onstage.\n\n&quot;Yelping and shouting like a genuine mental case, frontman Tiger Merritt rides a joyously chaotic wave on [the band's] debut,&quot; writes Jon Young in SPIN's album review, featured in our upcoming April issue. &quot;Morning Teleportation possess their own wacky identity, lurching from avant-garde mischief to pop operatics to folk sweetness.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\nMorning Teleportation Expanding Anyway 01.
