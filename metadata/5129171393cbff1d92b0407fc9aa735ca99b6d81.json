The Production Assistant plug-in automates many frequent tasks and processes to save hours of tedious editing work. And, with a complete set of video tutorials to help you get started, it's easy to use.\n\n    Workflow Automation Tools\n\nThe Vegas Pro Production Assistant plug-in includes tools to automatically insert crossfades between clips, add and customize lower thirds, and create photo and video montages from your media. It also streamlines common tasks such as stereo to mono split, crossfade creation, audio ducking, and archiving. More about workflow automation tools\n\n    Project Templates\n\nSetting up a Vegas Pro project as a templateÃ¢â‚¬â€with your regularly used titles, lower thirds, credits, and empty placeholder events Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is a powerful way to save time on repetitive tasks. The Production Assistant takes efficiency to a whole new level. Simply select the media you want to replace your placeholder slugs, click to process, and voila! Your project is ready to go. With project templates, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never have to start with an empty project again!\n\n    Batch Processing\n\nBatch processing in the Vegas Pro Production Assistant goes well beyond your run-of-the-mill media encoders. You can select multiple files, multiple output formats, and walk away while Vegas Pro and the Production Assistant output every format you desire. But what really sets the Production Assistant apart is the ability to treat multiple files with processes such as image overlay, aspect ratio convert, broadcast color correction, normalize audio, reduce interlace flicker, adjust playback rate, and more.\n\nPlatform : Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1\nLanguage : English\n \n \n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES]\n================\n\nRead .info file into folder\n\n\nNOTE: Keygens, patches, Activators, Cracks, Loaders etc. are always scanned with\n      Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 Latest Version to Avoid Virus \n      issues.\n      ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5129171393cbff1d92b0407fc9aa735ca99b6d81","amp;dn":"Sony+Vegas+Pro+Production+Assistant+2.0.11+%2B+Keygen-Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5129171393cbff1d92b0407fc9aa735ca99b6d81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,41,23,19,147,203,255,29,146,176,64,127,201,170,115,92,169,155,109,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
