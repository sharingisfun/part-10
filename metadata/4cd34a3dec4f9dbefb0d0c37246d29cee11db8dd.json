Following on a couple of years from both a celebratory tour and her fine turn on Basement Jaxx's Kish Kash, her full solo debut, Mantaray, is a bit of a different effort for her, though with a couple of drawbacks. Working with producers Steve Evans and Charlie Jones (the latter having notably collaborated with one of Siouxsie's many descendants, Goldfrapp; \nthere's definitely more than a slight hint of her compressed glam kick throughout), Siouxsie on Mantaray resembles nothing in her past so much as the 1991 Banshees album Superstition, a sometimes thrilling but at points compromised experimentation with already well-worn dance styles. Thankfully, the atmosphere of 2007 is far more chaotically all-embracing for a magpie-like approach, and at its best Mantaray embraces this -- lead single &quot;Into a Swan&quot; is a fierce bit of industrial glam-punk with more feedback than most bands could provide, its closest cousin perhaps being Depeche Mode's snarling &quot;A Pain That I'm Used To.&quot; \nOther highlights include &quot;Loveless&quot; -- nothing to do with My Bloody Valentine, but with a strutting kick all its own -- and the concluding &quot;Heaven and Alchemy,&quot; a fine piano-led comedown. After a strong start, though, the album gets a bit flat, with some songs like &quot;One Mile Below&quot; sounding dramatic enough but also too reminiscent of past Banshees/Creatures highlights to truly stand out. \nThis said, Siouxsie's voice remains as strong as ever before, and she enters her fourth decade of performing with style and grace perfectly intact.
