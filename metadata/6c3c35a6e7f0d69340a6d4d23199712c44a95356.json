Church doesn&amp;#x27;t tell him what he is getting. And Church sends a woman, Maggie with him to make sure he gets it. They find the plane and get the thing but some men take one of Barney&amp;#x27;s people hostage and the leader tells him to give him what they got or he&amp;#x27;ll kill his hostage. The give it to him but he kills his hostage anyway. Barney asks Maggie what was so important about that thing. She says that it showed the location of a Russian plutonium storage mine.
