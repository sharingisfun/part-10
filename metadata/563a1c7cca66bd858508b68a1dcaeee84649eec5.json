Before, two of its segments (including Peter and the Wolf) were released on home video individually with additional cartoons added to them in the 1980s and 1990s. This release was edited to remove &quot;The Martins and the Coys&quot;, because it had &quot;graphic gunplay not suitable for children.&quot; The Japanese laserdisc includes all the cuts made to the VHS/DVD versions. No other release has been scheduled. It is the only film in the Disney Animated Classics canon never to see a release on Region 2 or Region 4 DVD.\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.6\n\nIMDB URL: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038718/\n\nsource: orig dvd\n\nVideo Format: xvid\n\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 905 MiB\nDuration : 1h 7mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 866 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 7mn\nBit rate : 1 693 Kbps\nWidth : 718 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.205\nStream size : 821 MiB (91%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:563a1c7cca66bd858508b68a1dcaeee84649eec5","amp;dn":"Disneys+Make+Mine+Music+1946%5Bxvid%5DThe_Stig%40TFRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"563a1c7cca66bd858508b68a1dcaeee84649eec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,58,28,124,202,102,189,133,133,8,182,138,29,202,238,232,70,73,238,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
