They are currently\nsigned to Sub Pop Records. The band often draws\ncomparisons to the indie rock band My Morning\nJacket largely due to the vocal similarities\nbetween Bridwell and My Morning Jacket lead singer\nJim James. Bridwell&amp;#039;s vocals have also been\ncompared to Perry Farrell of Jane&amp;#039;s Addiction,\nearly Neil Young, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming\nLips by All Music Guide.[1]\n\nBand of Horses was formed by Ben Bridwell (guitar,\nvocals) and Mat Brooke (guitar) in 2004 after the\nbreak-up of their previous band, Carissa&amp;#039;s Wierd.\nThe group initially got attention from Sub Pop\nrecords after opening for Iron &amp; Wine in Seattle\narea shows. In 2005, the band released their debut\nEP, Band of Horses Tour EP, which was sold\nexclusively at shows and on Sub Pop&amp;#039;s website.\nTheir debut full-length, Everything All the Time\nwas recorded in 2005 with producer Phil Ek and\nreleased on March 21, 2006 to generally good\nreviews.[2]\n\nOn July 13, 2006, Band of Horses appeared on the\nLate Show with David Letterman sans Brooke. As of\nJuly 25, 2006, Mat Brooke left Band of Horses [3]\nto focus more on his other band, Grand Archives,\nwho had also signed to Sub Pop.[4]\n\nThe band&amp;#039;s second album, Cease to Begin, is slated\nfor release on October 9 2007.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:957a2d8b7234ceff976f26c98f954544c2eca245","amp;dn":"Band_of_Horses-Cease_to_Begin-2007-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"957a2d8b7234ceff976f26c98f954544c2eca245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,122,45,139,114,52,206,255,151,111,38,201,143,149,69,68,194,236,162,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
