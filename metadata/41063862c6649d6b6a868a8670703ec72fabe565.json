In Gardens examines more than thirty of the most influential recent landscape projects in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, and from designers like Kathryn Gustafson, Dani Karavan, and Charles Jencks. In the process, this panoramic book illuminates a new paradigm of garden design in Europe and provides a fount of inspiration for landscape designers everywhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41063862c6649d6b6a868a8670703ec72fabe565","amp;dn":"In+Gardens+-+Profiles+of+Contemporary+European+Landscape+Archite","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41063862c6649d6b6a868a8670703ec72fabe565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,6,56,98,198,100,157,107,106,134,138,134,112,112,62,199,47,171,229,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
