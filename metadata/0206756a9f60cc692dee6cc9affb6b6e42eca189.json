Here are a few Quotes, to give you an idea of what these audio books are all about: \r\n\r\n&quot;The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.&quot; \r\n&quot;There are three constants in life... change, choice and principles.&quot; \r\n&quot;Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, \r\nchances are it will burn very briefly.&quot; \r\n&quot;Our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything \r\noutside ourselves will affect us.&quot; \r\n&quot;I am personally convinced that one person can be a change catalyst, a \r\ntransformer in any situation, any organization. Such an individual is yeast that can \r\nleaven an entire loaf. It requires vision, initiative, patience, respect, persistence, \r\ncourage, and faith to be a transforming leader.&quot; \r\n&quot;Management works in the system; Leadership works on the system.&quot; \r\n&quot;If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to \r\nthe wrong place faster&quot; \r\n\r\nAbout Dr. Covey \r\n\r\nAn internationally respected leadership authority, family expert, teacher, organizational consultant, and author, Dr. Covey dedicates his life to teaching principle-centered living and leadership to individuals, families, and organizations.
