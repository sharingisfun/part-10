Not exactly historically accurate, but great music. Also, guest appearances by many great musicians of the time.\n\nAmazon review quote:\n\nQuote:\nThe consensus has long been that &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; has problems when it comes to being historically accurate but the music is absolutely great. Steve Allen plays Goodman in such a low-keyed manner it is hard to reconcile this with the jovial host of &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; Donna Reed plays love interest Alice Hammond, who is quicker to fall for Benny than she is for his music. It seems Alice is a society gal, who tags along with her brother John (Herbert Anderson) from time to time when he hits the jazz clubs. But when John invites Benny to play a Mozart clarinet concerto at their home for the society crowd, Alice is convinced Benny is going to be humiliated. Instead, it is Alice who has her eyes opened, especially after meeting the wonderful Dora Goodman (Berta Gersten), who wishes her husband was still alive to hear their son play &quot;good&quot; music. The other wonderful scene is when Goodman's band is going down for the last time and he decides they might as well go out playing HIS kind of music. As the band plays on he is stunned to see the kids are just standing and LISTENING to his music rather than dancing. The rest is history, or at least the Hollywood version of history. Gene Krupa,Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson and Sammy Davis Sr. are some of the jazz greats who appear as themselves in this film. Barry Truex plays Goodman at age 16 and actually does a fantastic job of playing Steve Allen at 16, because there is no problem seeing than as the same person a decade apart. The film climaxes with his landmark Carnegie Hall band concert in 1938. Along the way there is the great music: &quot;Let's Dance, &quot;Stompin' At The Savoy,&quot; &quot;one O'Clock Jump,&quot; &quot;Moonglow,&quot; &quot;Sing Sing Sing (With A Swing)&quot; and the proverbial much much more. The obvious double-feature with &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; would be &quot;The Glenn Miller Story,&quot; in that order if you want to do the history right. \n\nnot my rip, something I picked up &amp; passing it along\n\ned2k://|file|The%20Benny%20Goodman%20Story%201955.avi|724300858|DB2F84DB8125FE9841FD04DAB0E2E913|/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9edb6da22e3ba6143bca013b35c47d1c440295b0","amp;dn":"The+Benny+Goodman+Story+%281955%29+Steve+Allen+%26+Donna+Reed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9edb6da22e3ba6143bca013b35c47d1c440295b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,219,109,162,46,59,166,20,59,202,1,59,53,196,125,28,68,2,149,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
