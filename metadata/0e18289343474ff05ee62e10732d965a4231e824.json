After cancelling the error message, you can drop the file successfully.\n    * You will receive an error message after cancelling a drag and drop operation from the latest Windows guest to an Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop host.\n    * If a guest is powered off while a drag and drop operation from a guest to a Linux host is in progress, drag and drop will not work after the guest is restarted. To workaround this issue, restart the host.\n    * Easy Install does not work for 32-bit and 64-bit FreeBSD 7.1 guests.\n    * Enabling Assistive Technology on a 64-bit SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10.1 host prevents the Workstation from starting.\n    * When converting Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003, the Server License Information selected in the Conversion Wizard is not used, as a result, the default licensing mode is used in the guest.\n    * On an Ubuntu 9.04 host, launching a Java application in a virtual machine that uses the Workstation Eclipse debugger plug-in, might cause Eclipse to crash.\n    * VMX hangs in an ATI fglrx driver on an Ubuntu 9.04 host.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n# On Linux hosts, Workstation will not exit normally if the Workspace preference Remember opened virtual machines between sessions is not selected.\n# Workstation virtual machines that were converted from ESX virtual machines might fail if the display is set to 8-bit color.\n# After installing and configuring VMware Tools on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, the sound does not work after restarting the guest.\n# On a Windows XP Service Pack 2 guest, the Hardware Wizard stops responding when installing Logitech QuickCAm Pro 9000.\n# Add enhanced SVGA and mouse drivers to support X.Org server version 1.6.\n# WLK DiskStress test fails with data corruption error on LSI Logic virtual device.\n# Moving files between shared folders or mapped drives in Windows guests that point to the same directory on the host, cause the files to disappear.\n# Pressing any keys while grabbing (for example, Ctrl+g) or ungrabbing become stuck on an Ubuntu 9.04 host.\n# On an Ubuntu 9.04 host clicking Tab &gt; Home in a guest makes the Workstation user interface disappear, including the current windows and windows for all other open virtual machines.\n# On Windows hosts, videos that are recorded while toggling between full screen mode and standard screen mode fail to play in Windows and VLC media players.\n# Workstation has been updated to power on the latest Microsoft Virtual PC files (.vhd). VMware recommends that you create a copy or linked clone of the image. If you do not create a copy, you cannot run the original virtual machine in VPC after running it in Workstation, because the virtual hardware layer has been modified.\n# Performance is slow when opening a Shared Folder for the first time in a Workstation Windows guest.\n# Drag and drop stops working when color depth is set to 16-bit on a Workstation guest.\n# When moving a virtual machine from a later version of Workstation to a 6.5.x version of Workstation, the taskbar icon indicates that a more current version of VMware Tools is available and that VMware Tools should be updated.\n# On Linux hosts, when you capture a screen shot to the clipboard by clicking VM &gt; Capture Screen, and paste the image into an image editor, the image colors do not display correctly.\n# NAT networking does not work on the latest Windows operating systems.\n# If VMware Workstation is installed using administrative installation on a 64-bit Windows host, you cannot use Map or Disconnect Virtual Disks.
