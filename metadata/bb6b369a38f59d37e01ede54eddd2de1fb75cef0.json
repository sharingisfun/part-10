Farlow\nPublisher: Dover Publications,\nPublished in: 1993\nISBN: 0-486-67620-X\nSubject: Mathematics\nPages: 414 pages\n\nReview\nMost physical phenomena, whether in the domain of fluid dynamics, electricity, magnetism, mechanics, optics, or heat flow, can be described in general by partial differential equations. Indeed, such equations are crucial to mathematical physics. Although simplifications can be made that reduce these equations to ordinary differential equations, nevertheless the complete description of physical systems resides in the general area of partial differential equations.\nThis highly useful text shows the reader how to formulate a partial differential equation from the physical problem (constructing the mathematical model) and how to solve the equation (along with initial and boundary conditions). Written for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, as well as professionals working in the applied sciences, this clearly written book offers realistic, practical coverage of diffusion-type problems, hyperbolic-type problems, elliptic-type problems, and numerical and approximate methods. Each chapter contains a selection of relevant problems (answers are provided) and suggestions for further reading.\n\nSEED as long as you can","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb6b369a38f59d37e01ede54eddd2de1fb75cef0","amp;dn":"Partial+Differential+Equations+for+Scientist+and+Engineers+by+St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb6b369a38f59d37e01ede54eddd2de1fb75cef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,107,54,154,56,245,157,55,224,30,222,84,237,221,45,225,251,117,206,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
