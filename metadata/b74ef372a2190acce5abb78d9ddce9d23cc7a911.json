Cities are home to half the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population and consume nearly three-quarters of its natural resources. For Reader, they are our most natural artifacts, the civic spirit of our collective ingenuity. He gives us the ecological and functional context of how cities evolved throughout human historyÃ¢â‚¬â€the connection between pottery making and childbirth in ancient Anatolia, plumbing and politics in ancient Rome, and revolution and street planning in nineteenth-century Paris. This illuminating study helps us to understand how urban centers thrive, decline, and rise againÃ¢â‚¬â€and prepares us for the role cities will play in the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74ef372a2190acce5abb78d9ddce9d23cc7a911","amp;dn":"John+Reader+-+Cities.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74ef372a2190acce5abb78d9ddce9d23cc7a911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,78,243,114,162,25,10,204,229,171,183,141,157,220,233,210,60,199,169,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
