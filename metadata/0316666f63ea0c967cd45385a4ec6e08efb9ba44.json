The former frontman of Screaming Trees, collaborator with Kurt Cobain and Queens Of The Stone Age, half of a modern day Nancy &amp; Lee with Isobel Campbell and, most commonly, solo artist, Lanegan is a man whose career has been defined by an unwillingness to sit still.\n\nLight In The Attic are set to shine a spotlight on this great American performer and songwriter with the release of Has God Seen My Shadow? An Anthology 1989-2011. Collecting LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo material for Sub Pop, Beggars and more plus 12 unreleased tracks, this is the archive treatment Mark has long deserved. It is released in two sumptuous formats: a Double-CD edition with a gatefold, tip-on jacket and a 44-page booklet comprising hand-written lyrics and rare archive photos by Charles Peterson and Steve Gullick, and a Triple-LP box set, each LP in single pocket jackets within a heavy, tip-on slip case, with a 20-page book featuring the same attention to detail and extras as the CD release.\n\nThe 32 tracks shine a light on MarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rare talent, and span the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire career, from 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album The Winding Sheet to a treasure trove of recent unreleased gems and feature such guests as PJ Harvey, Josh Homme and J Mascis. His is a sound of grizzled vocals and dark melody, its lyrics chiseled out of late night thoughts and dark humor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0316666f63ea0c967cd45385a4ec6e08efb9ba44","amp;dn":"Mark+Lanegan+-+Has+God+Seen+My+Shadow%3F+An+Anthology+1989-2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0316666f63ea0c967cd45385a4ec6e08efb9ba44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,22,102,111,99,234,12,150,124,212,83,133,164,236,110,8,239,185,186,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
