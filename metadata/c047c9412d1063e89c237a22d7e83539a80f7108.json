Led by Norman Grant, the Twinkles began in the early '60s as a trio featuring Grant and his two brothers singing in a slick trio style similar to that of the Melodians and the Mighty Diamonds. In the early '70s, the group hooked up with the influential producer and arranger Bunny Lee, a union that produced a number of reggae hits including &quot;We Can Do It Too&quot; and &quot;Miss Laba Laba.&quot; In 1975, the Twinkles released their best and most widely known record, Rasta Pon Top, a rasta-infused, roots-heavy demi-masterpiece that included soul and gospel vocal stylings within the deep grooves. Although hardcore reggae audiences were the principal fans of the Twinkle Brothers, Grant and company were consistently releasing chart-topping records. As much as this brought great success to the band, it also created a significant amount of friction, as Grant began seeing himself more as a solo act and less as a member of a trio. This culminated in Grant's pursuit of a solo career as more of a MOR soul singer. It wasn't an awful decision by any stretch of the imagination, but his solo work wasn't nearly as good as what the Twinkles had been doing. \n\n\nTrebunie-Tutki is a folk musical group. A family of musicians originating from Bialy Dunajec village by Zakopane, Poland.\n\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae/Folk\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tJaro Records\t\t\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Jo CÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ek Wolny/Human\n02.Krzesany Po Dwa/Going To The Village\n03.Wiecno/Skanking On The Grass\n04.Drobiony Orawski/Downby The Stream\n05.Maz ZabÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³jca/Husband The Outlaw\n06.Krzesany RogoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿niczaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ski/Youre So Old\n07.Han W GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³rze/Prayer\n08.Pierso Godzina/Don't Betray My Love\n09.ZbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³jnicki/Outlaw Skanking\n10.Orle PiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ro/Wanted\n11.W Stylu Tele-Video-Zyjnym/Beloved Tvideo\n12.MilÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â³oki Blues/Our Blues From Us\n13.W Dusak/Drying Source\n14.Twoja MiÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â³a/Motherland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c047c9412d1063e89c237a22d7e83539a80f7108","amp;dn":"Twinkle+Bros.+%26+Trebunie-Tutki++Greatest+Hits+%282010%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c047c9412d1063e89c237a22d7e83539a80f7108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,71,201,65,45,16,99,232,156,35,122,34,215,232,53,57,168,15,113,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
