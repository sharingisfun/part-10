I've Got Your Number\n2. Smile Upon Me\n3. Cuddle Fuddle\n4. Live to Tell the Tale\n5. Better Things\n6. Sleepyhead\n\nPlanetary wrote:\n\nBoston's Passion Pit is the brainchild of Michael Angelakos, a songwriter's songwriter drawing from a variety of influences, from the classic pop of Randy Newman to the synth work of Giorgio Moroder. The Chunk of Change EP was originally put together as a (belated) Valentine's Day gift to Angelakos' girlfriend and was written and recorded entirely on his own, showcasing Angelakos' signature euphoric and blissfully melancholic sound. Playing as a five piece live, the band has already blown away audiences opening up for Death Cab for Cutie, These New Puritans, and more and won the WFNX/Boston Phoenix Best New Music Poll as Best Local Act of 2008.\n\n\n\nGood Weather for Airstrikes wrote:\n\nHoly shit, itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Passion Pit. Far and away my most listened to band of 2008, the creators of the best song to grace these ears in fucking forever (thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢d be ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“SleepyheadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½) and the most exciting band to come out of the States in as long as I can remember, Passion Pit are about to fuck shit up for real. The brainchild of frontman/creative force Michael Angelakos, they sound like theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve taken the best (read: most euphoric) parts of MGMT, Black Kids and The Go! Team, and on the new material theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re currently working on it sounds like Ratatat are very much in danger of being beaten at their own game. WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve got some seriously exciting news to announce next week regarding the band, but in the meantime take ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“SleepyheadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ for a spin and donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t forget to pick your jaw up the floor. Yeah, itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s like that.\n\nGive it a week or so and Pitchfork will be shitting themselves.\n\n\nChunk of Change Original EP\n\nThe original Chunk of Change EP, back when Passion Pit was a solo project.
