He provides him with fatherly career advice (always carry a knife, for example) and is determined they should share the joys of pit bulls (fed with lots of Tabasco sauce), Internet porn, and all manner of more serious criminality.  Des, on the other hand, desires nothing more than books to read and a girl to love (and to protect a family secret that could be the death of him).  But just as he begins to lead a gentler, healthier life, his uncleÃ¢â‚¬â€once again in a London prisonÃ¢â‚¬â€wins Ã‚Â£140 million in the lottery and upon his release hires a public relations firm and begins dating a cannily ambitious topless model and Ã¢â‚¬Å“poet.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Strangely, however, Lionel's true nature remains uncompromised while his problems, and therefore also Desmond's, seem only to multiply.\n\n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Despite a time frame that gallops forward into 2013 and a wealth of irresistibly hyperbolized pop cultural references, Lionel Asbo is at heart an old-fashioned novel, earnest in its agenda... a theme familiar to the audience of Amis's forebear, Dickens:  the corrupting influence of money... Amis is, like Dickens, an insistently moral writer, satire being an edifying genre with a noble cause: the improvement of society.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Kathryn Harris, The New York Times Book Review (front page)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“One of Amis's funniest novels Ã¢â‚¬â€in a league with Ã¢â‚¬ËœMoneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœLondon Fields.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢  Amis, like his heroes Nabokov and Bellow, writes exuberant, ecstatic prose.  His ear is precisely tuned, and his sentencesÃ¢â‚¬â€in narration and dialogueÃ¢â‚¬â€are lethal.  Our hero is a thug named Asbo (for Anti-Social Behaviour Order), a brilliant sociopath who delivers beatings for sport and feeds Tabasco to his pit bulls to make them extra-ornery in the morning.  (Reader alert: Asbo delivers the most hilarious wedding speech in the history of English literature.)  He sort of raises his nephew, an ambitious lad who happens to be sleeping with Grandmum.  Mid-book, Asbo wins the lottery, a Dickensian turn of fortune that not only leads to some unforgettable comic opportunities but deepens matters as well. The jokes, the high-voltage sentencesÃ¢â‚¬â€all that energyÃ¢â‚¬â€begin to drive an increasingly complicated machine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The New Yorker  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a1757a9787ff6a2a548993991f15f58be9b33d","amp;dn":"Martin+Amis+-+Lionel+Asbo+-+State+of+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a1757a9787ff6a2a548993991f15f58be9b33d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,161,117,122,151,135,255,106,42,84,137,147,153,31,21,245,139,233,179,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
