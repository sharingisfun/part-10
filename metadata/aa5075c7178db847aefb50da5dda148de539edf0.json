Dr Asoke Gupta (Soumitra Chatterjee) is the Chief Medical Officer in the local charitable hospital and a much admired man in the town. Dr. Gupta, puzzled by a sudden outbreak of gastric diseases in the town decides to investigate and to his horror finds that it is due to contaminated water from the great temple. But as soon as he makes public his findings and calls for the complete overhaul of the temple's water supply system, he comes up against a wall od opposition led by his brother Nisith (Dhritiman Chattopadhyay). Many of his erstwhile friends including the editor of the local newspaper (Dipankar Dey) turn away from him. His daughter loses her teaching job, Dr. Gupta is suspended from his job pending dismissal, his landlord serves notice and he is branded as the &quot;Enemy of the People&quot;. Just as all seems lost, hope emerges from the youth of the town led by Ronen, a bank employee (Bhishma Guhathakurata) and a local reporter (Subhendu Chattopadhyay)...\n\n\nComments:\n---------\n\nGanashatru is a straightforward film that  highlights the impact blind superstition can have and how superstition can be cynically misused by the administration. Dr Gupta raises a voice against religious dogma and all hell breaks loose. It hurts the religious sentiments of people whose blind faith will brook no stigma against thee temple. The businessman sees a loss of business, the bureaucrat a loss of tourist inflow and everyone is up in arms. No matter that Dr. Gupta is not against religion. No matter that he is willing to present scientific evidence. No matter that, in the past, he has been much admired by the very people who now villify him. As the juggernaut nearly overwhels Ray's protagonist, hope raises its head in the form of the youth who rayy behind the beleaguered Dr. Gupta.\n\nRay is clearly sending out a message against religious dogma in this film. In a way he was foretelling the strife that occured in India barely two years after this film was released. Ray, the humanist, still sees hope, not in the old guard who profit from that dogma but from among the educated youth, for they will make the country of the future.\n\nBut thi film is certainly not among Ray's best. In fact, together with Sakha Praskha, this film represents the nadir of Ray's great career. For a master of detail, Ray makes elementary mistakes. He forgets that Public Health is not the responsibility of the Municipal Body alone, and there is a full Health Department, whose job is to monitor such outbreaks and take remedial action. It is there in every district and small town. Dr. Gupta as the city hospital in-charge would have had regular intercourse with such persons. Ray (and his brother the Municipal chairman) does not seem to know that small town judges cannot hear public interest litigation. There an numerous such small and large errors.\n\nThe film moves at a very slow and stilted pace but picks up momentum towrds the end. The best part of the film is the acting. Soumitra id very good, but he is overshadowed by Dhritiman Chakraborty and in some scenes by Dipankar Dey. The ladies have a limited, supportive role, but Ruma Guha Thakurata does well as the long suffering wife who stands by her husband and admires him for his ethical stand.\n\nTechnically, camera work of Barun Raha is competent and not flashy. Music by Ray is wonderful as usual. \n\n\nUploader's Notes:\n-----------------\n\nThe quality of the transfer of the film to the Eclipse DVD is not as good as &quot;The Home &amp; the World&quot; or even the &quot;Stranger&quot;. Stillit is the best available. I have sharpened the image a bit, tried to bring out more detail and added a bit of vibrancy to the colours. The changes are minor.\n\n\nIMDB Link:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097409/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097409/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSample:\n-----------\n\nRipper:\n-------\ndebpk77","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5075c7178db847aefb50da5dda148de539edf0","amp;dn":"GANASHATRU-Satyajit+Ray-Criterion%28Eclipse%29-X264.AAC-Bangla.ESubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5075c7178db847aefb50da5dda148de539edf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,80,117,199,23,141,184,71,174,251,80,218,93,218,20,141,229,57,237,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
