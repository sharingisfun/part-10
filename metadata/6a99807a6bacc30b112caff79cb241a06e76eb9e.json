Castles, Italian villas and French chateaux dotted the coast. Formal gardens were landscaped to match the magnificence of historic castles, and palatial residences of Europe were copied. It was in these homes that F. Scott Fitzgerald\nfollowed his most famous character, Jay Gatsby, through an elegant life of lavish\nparties in mirrored ballrooms, finely carved paneled dining rooms and manicured gardens. While the original mansion that inspired Fitzgerald has long since been replaced by split level homes of a more prosaic time and the way of life enjoyed in\nthese mansions has vanished, many of the homes remain hidden behind tightly closed\ngates as forgotten relics of a remarkable era.\n\nThis lavishly illustrated book visits 45 of the most spectacular examples of these\noften flamboyant homesÃ¢â‚¬â€many still standing, some destroyedÃ¢â‚¬â€and shows in loving\ndetail their most outstanding decorative and architectural features. The mansions\nare as consistently, and as divergently, fascinating as the characters of the people\nwho owned them. The lively, informative text recreates the lost social world they were meant to hold, telling how and why they were built, who built them and who has\nlived in them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a99807a6bacc30b112caff79cb241a06e76eb9e","amp;dn":"The+Mansions+of+Long+Islands+gold+coast+%28Architecture+Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a99807a6bacc30b112caff79cb241a06e76eb9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,153,128,122,107,172,195,11,17,44,175,247,156,178,65,160,110,118,235,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
