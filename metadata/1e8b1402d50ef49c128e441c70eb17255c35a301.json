Yet these works reveal even more clearly than the paintings one of the dominant forces in Gauguin's work: his admiration for the &quot;noble savage&quot; Gauguin himself regarded his sculpture as important as his painting. Indeed, toward the end of his life he expressed a preference for woodcarving.\n\nThis distinguished volume is both a study and a catalogue raisonne of the known pieces of Gauguin's sculpture and ceramics, most of which have never been published before. The text deals with the growth of the artist as a sculptor and the artistic influences that formed his style. In addition, the development of the aesthetic principles of Gauguin's art is shown in relation to both the sculpture and his\npaintings. Specific important works in each period of the artist's career are analyzed in detail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8b1402d50ef49c128e441c70eb17255c35a301","amp;dn":"Sculpture+and+ceramics+of+Paul+Gauguin+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8b1402d50ef49c128e441c70eb17255c35a301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,139,20,2,213,14,244,156,18,142,68,28,112,235,23,37,92,53,163,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
