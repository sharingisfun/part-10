But in middle age, he discovered the new anxieties and pleasures of mastering a new culture. When he left fifteen years later to take a teaching position in the U.S., he was fluent enough to broadcast on French radio and TV, and in his work as a journalist, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d made the acquaintance of everyone from Yves Saint Laurent to Catherine Deneuve to Michel Foucault. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d also developed a close friendship with an older woman, Marie-Claude, through which heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d come to understand French life and culture in a deeper way.\n\nThe bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title evokes the Parisian landscape in the eternal mists and the half-light, the serenity of the city compared to the New York White had known (and vividly recalled in City Boy). White fell headily in love with the city and its culture: both intoxicated and intellectually stimulated. He became the definitive biographer of Jean Genet; he wrote lives of Marcel Proust and Arthur Rimbaud; and he became a recipient of the French Order of Arts and Letters. Inside a Pearl recalls those fertile years for White. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a memoir which gossips and ruminates, and offers a brilliant examination of a city and a culture eternally imbued with an aura of enchantment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dba379c7f82fceadcdc43fa1649da8223b43c0c","amp;dn":"Inside+a+Pearl-+My+Years+in+Paris+by+Edmund+White+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dba379c7f82fceadcdc43fa1649da8223b43c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,186,55,156,127,130,252,234,220,220,67,250,22,73,218,130,35,180,60,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
