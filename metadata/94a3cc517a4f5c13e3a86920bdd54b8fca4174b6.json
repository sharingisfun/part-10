An absolutely incredible CD. For those of you who are really into the ABBA thing, stay clear. There is a risk you won't like what Nils and his Funk Unit troopers did to your favourite music. Actually, I have even played this CD to die-hard ABBA-fans of Swedish origin and it took time before they realized what was going on. In other words, not particularly true to the original but who wanted that anyway? Instead, you get the most sensational funk/soul-CD I have heard in a long time. Great musicians, great sound, great music. Buy it.  (Sol Sting, amazon.com)\n\nA great reworking of many of Abba's classics played with funk and style. This album is almost a guilty secret amongst jazz musicians and brass players; torn between the lack of cool of Abba and the seriously great performances and sheer toe-tapping infectious groove of this album. The arrangements are good; some working better than others. Summernight City and Voulez-Vous are stand out tracks for me, plus Benny Andersson dropping in to play piano on When all is said and done.
