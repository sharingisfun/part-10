An epic about love and friendship in the twenty-first century that goes into some of the darkest places fiction has ever traveled and yet somehow improbably breaks through into the light. Truly an amazementÃ¢â‚¬â€and a great gift for its publisher.\n\nWhen four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity. Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not only be unable to overcomeÃ¢â‚¬â€but that will define his life forever.\n\nIn rich and resplendent prose, Yanagihara has fashioned a tragic and transcendent hymn to brotherly love, a masterful depiction of heartbreak, and a dark examination of the tyranny of memory and the limits of human endurance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:422ac0eb310376199d848c8033af85a058e9ffc4","amp;dn":"A+Little+Life+-+Hanya+Yangihara","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"422ac0eb310376199d848c8033af85a058e9ffc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,42,192,235,49,3,118,25,157,132,140,128,51,175,133,160,88,233,255,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
