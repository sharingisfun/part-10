Garland fanatics feared a fiasco, but the show was a triumph. His sophisticated act of homage to his hero was both a loving tribute and an arch commentary on the original, featuring classics like &quot;Over The Rainbow,&quot; &quot;Come Rain Or Come Shine&quot; and &quot;Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart.&quot;\n\nBacked by a 36-piece orchestra and arranged by the Broadway famed Stephen Oremus (Wicked, Avenue Q), Rufus&amp;#039;s vocal talent soars over those classic melodies on this 2-disc set. \n\nDisc: 1\n1.
