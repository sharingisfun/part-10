According to the liner notes by Ira Gitler, this session was &quot;not recorded in a\n nightclub performance but, in its informal symmetry, it matches the relaxed atmosphere that the best of\n those made in that manner engender. Everyone was really together, in all the most positive meanings of \nthat word.&quot; It was recorded by Rudy Van Gelder at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs. Since its\n release, Go! has received very positive reviews from critics, with Allmusic giving it a five star rating\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Dexter Gordon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone\n    Sonny Clark Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano\n    Butch Warren Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n    Billy Higgins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\n======================================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1. &quot;Cheese Cake&quot;   \tDexter Gordon \t6:33\n2. &quot;Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry&quot;   \tJule Styne, Sammy Cahn \t5:23\n3. &quot;Second Balcony Jump&quot;   \tBilly Eckstine, Gerald Valentine \t7:05\n4. &quot;Love for Sale&quot;   \tCole Porter \t7:40\n5. &quot;Where Are You?&quot;   \tJimmy McHugh, Harold Adamson \t5:21\n6. &quot;Three O'Clock in the Morning&quot;   \tDorothy Terris, Julian Robledo \t5:42\n\n=======================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 837 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Go!
