HyperSnap combines the power of a first-class screen capture application with an advanced image editing utility - wrapped into one easy-to-use tool!\r\n\r\nTop Features\r\n\r\nImage captures from any where on the screen or multiple monitors, in any shape or size.\r\nNew &amp; powerful image capture, editing, annotation and  manipulation tools. Objects drawn over images can now be selected, edited, shown and hidden, moved, deleted any time. A new native file format saves the objects drawn for further editing later, or save a standard image and have the object &quot;imprinted&quot; permanently on them.\r\nUnlimited undo/redo.\r\nNOTE: TextSnap is no longer supported for new programs using accelerated graphics or running under Windows 8.\r\nTextSnapâ„¢ feature to capture editable text from almost anywhere on the screen. Can also capture tab-delimited data for easy paste into MS Excel.\r\nCapture dropdown menus and lists with hotkey feature or delayed capture.\r\nImage stamps, frames, drop shadow, free-hand capture, FTP server uploads, more.\r\nAutomatic color substitution.\r\nNon-rectangular window capture.\r\nButton Capture  - perfect for professional technical writers who need to snap and document dozens of buttons!\r\nAuto-scrolls and concurrently captures long web pages and other. documents, enabling it to grab more than is visible on the screen.\r\nTightly integrates with the MS Windows clipboard to automate repetitive tasks - will even automatically PASTE capture images where needed!\r\nAutomatically saves your captures to graphics files.\r\nDoubles as effective image viewer, format converter (over 20 image formats supported).\r\nFully customizable user interface. Rearrange menus and toolbars any way you want, assign any keyboard shortcuts you like, tear off menus to create instant toolbars, even control HyperSnap with voice commands!\r\nExtended Window Capture function resizes a window to be much bigger than the screen before the capture - in one quick step, no auto-scrolling.\r\n\r\nMuch, much more!.\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: http://www.hyperionics.com/hsdx/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fb359771374a53c7ae7b29dba00e13673b17985","amp;dn":"Hyperionics+HyperSnap+v8.12.01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fb359771374a53c7ae7b29dba00e13673b17985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,179,89,119,19,116,165,60,122,231,178,157,186,0,225,54,115,177,121,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
