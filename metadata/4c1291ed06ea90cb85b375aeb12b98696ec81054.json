It presents future innovations, often referred as  Ã¢â‚¬Å“automotive systems engineeringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  These cause fundamental innovations in the field of driver assistance systems and electro-mobility as well as fundamental changes in the architecture of the vehicles. New driving functionalities can only be realized if the software programs of multiple electronic control units work together correctly. This volume presents the new and innovative methods which are mandatory to master the complexity of the vehicle of the future.\n\nProduct Details :-\n\nHardcover: 264 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2013 edition (June 3, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3642364543\nISBN-13: 978-3642364549\nProduct Dimensions: 9.4 x 6.1 x 0.8 inches\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nProfessor Markus Maurer (*1967) holds the Chair in Electronical Vehicle Systems at the Institute of Control Engineering at the Technical University, Braunschweig. He teaches electronical auto systems, data bus systems in street vehicles, industrial communication with field buses, fundamentals of electrical engineering and drivers' assistance systems with automatic perception. \n\nHermann Winner (*1955) is Professor for Vehicle Technology at the Institute of Automotive Engineering at theTechnicalUniversity, Darmstadt.\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c1291ed06ea90cb85b375aeb12b98696ec81054","amp;dn":"Automotive+Systems+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c1291ed06ea90cb85b375aeb12b98696ec81054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,18,145,237,6,234,144,203,133,179,117,174,177,43,152,105,110,200,16,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
