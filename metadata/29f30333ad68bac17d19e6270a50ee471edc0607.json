Also, see the LOOKHERE folder.\n\nUnless you want an original install for your authentic PC DOS machine, this is the version to get. Should work on Mac and Linux too.\n\nThis is an awesome game, especially if you love the original Trek like I do. It is the sequel to Star Trek: 25th Anniversary, and includes full voiceovers from the original cast! Let&amp;#039;s see...William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, DeForest Kelley, Majel Barrett... \n\nIt&amp;#039;s an action adventure game. You get to phaser people (on stun or kill), use the tricorder, etc. You get multiple dialogue choices so Kirk can either be diplomatic or flippant.\n\nA must play for adventure gamers, and works great on the latest DOSBox 0.70 and Windows XP. DOSBox and D.O.G. configuration files are included. Just extract and move the STRCD folder to C:\\.\n\nThe Star Trek: Judgment Rites Collector&amp;#039;s Edition CD Game\nVoiced by the Original Actors!\n\n--All the original CD Content Without the CD--\n--No Install-- --Original Quality-- --Works with DOSBox 0.7--\n\nAn Action/Adventure Game in the Original Star Trek Universe\n\nWhen you run the game you should see the Interplay splash screen followed by the voice of William Shatner, the one and only original Capt. Kirk, narrating the intro.\n\nI tested this Star Trek Judgment Rites Collector&amp;#039;s Ed. CD game with DOSBox 0.70 from  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dosbox.sourceforge.net/information.php?page=0,&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dosbox.sourceforge.net/information.php?page=0,&lt;/a&gt;\nusing the D.O.G. 1.53 frontend fromon Windows XP.\n\nYou can get the original CD image from Aldrisang&amp;#039;s torrent.\n\nEnjoy!  :) Seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f30333ad68bac17d19e6270a50ee471edc0607","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Judgment+Rites+Collector%5C%27s+Ed.+CD+DOSBox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f30333ad68bac17d19e6270a50ee471edc0607","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,243,3,51,173,104,186,193,125,25,230,39,10,80,238,71,30,220,6,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
