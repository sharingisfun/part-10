Mellon Collie has just about every kind of music you can hope to find - ballads, prog, metal, alt-rock. A handful of songs feel superfluous, but the vast majority of them just feel like a musical quilt. That is, two musical quilts. The tone of each disc is quite different, with Dawn to Dusk being a rockier album more in tune with the past Pumpkins releases. Twilight To Starlight has a more experimental, sad feel. \nBilly Corgan's reedy voice weaves seamlessly into the complex music, singing songs about loneliness, pessimism and longing for love. His songwriting is exceptional here: his style is best described as poetry set to music. Guitar riffs both furious and gentle, sweeping strings, piano, Chamberlin's percussion and D'arcy's good bass work move up and down the scale, from soft to scathing. With its epic music and tight lyrics, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is madly brilliant. Dark, sweet, sad, and angry, this is a modern classic. \nNice artwork too, recalling Genesis' Foxtrot; complete scans included.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 76\nArtist: Smashing Pumpkins\nAlbum: Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness\nYear: 1995\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:695681b45d9337960657dd6dae1ef33d950fc9b1","amp;dn":"Smashing+Pumpkins+-+Mellon+Collie+And...+%5BFLAC-1995%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"695681b45d9337960657dd6dae1ef33d950fc9b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,86,129,180,93,147,55,150,6,87,221,109,174,30,243,61,149,15,201,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
