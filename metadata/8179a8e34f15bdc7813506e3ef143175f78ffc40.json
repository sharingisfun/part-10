Smith is a rock critic's dream, a poet as steeped in '60s garage rock as she is in French Symbolism; &quot;Land&quot; carries on from the Doors' &quot;The End,&quot; marking her as a successor to Jim Morrison, while the borrowed choruses of &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot; are more in tune with the era of sampling than they were in the '70s. Producer John Cale respected Smith's primitivism in a way that later producers did not, and the loose, improvisatory song structures worked with her free verse to create something like a new spoken word/musical art form: Horses was a hybrid, the sound of a post-Beat poet, as she put it, &quot;dancing around to the simple rock &amp; roll song.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8179a8e34f15bdc7813506e3ef143175f78ffc40","amp;dn":"Patti+Smith+-+Horses+%281975%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8179a8e34f15bdc7813506e3ef143175f78ffc40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,121,168,227,79,21,189,199,129,53,6,227,239,20,49,117,247,143,252,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
