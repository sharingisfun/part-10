Large Israeli companies develop and test the vessels of future warfare, which is then sold worldwide by private Israeli agents, who manipulate a network of Israeli politicians and army commanders, while Israeli theoreticians explain to various foreign countries how to defeat civil and para-military resistance. All based on the extensive Israeli experience. The film reveals The Lab, which has transformed the Israeli military occupation of Gaza and the West Bank from a burden to a marketable, highly profitable, national asset.\n\nRun time: 58:41\nLanguage: Hebrew w/ English Subs (burned in)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dba91d91fb0744ddf5c27d3fdd8f4f928c3b328e","amp;dn":"The+Lab+%282013%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dba91d91fb0744ddf5c27d3fdd8f4f928c3b328e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,169,29,145,251,7,68,221,245,194,125,63,221,143,79,146,140,59,50,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
