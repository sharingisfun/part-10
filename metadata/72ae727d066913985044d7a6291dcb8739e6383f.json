Please make sure to update to the latest version of\n       Winrar (at least Winrar v5.0) so you can extract the contents.  \n       The update is free, there is no reason not to update.\n\n\n       Install TuneUpUtilities2014_en-US.exe, which ONLY installs build\n       221.  Make sure to UNCHECK: &quot;Launch TuneUp Utilities 2014 when\n       finished&quot; on the final installation window.\n\n       You can now either let the Update Wizard download and install the\n       Build 275, or if your offline or prefer to close it, then unzip\n       package_14.0.1000.221_to_14.0.1000.275.zip to a temp folder and\n       then ONLY launch base_14.0.1000.221_to_14.0.1000.275.msp and\n       allow this to update your TuneUp Utilities to v14.0.1000.275.\n       AGAIN make sure to UNCHECK: &quot;Launch TuneUp Utilities 2014 when\n       finished&quot; on the final update installation window.  If you\n       recieve an error 2229, sorry your saved msi from original msi to\n       allow updates is missing or not compatible and you will need to\n       uninstall TuneUp Utilities and then reinstall with provided setup\n       and allow it to auto update.  Two PCs tested had this issue.\n\n       If you chose to manually update and recieved an error about\n       file(s) inuse (because you didn't uncheck as stated before), make\n       sure to close the front end and then stop the service\n       &quot;TuneUp.UtilitiesSvc&quot; with task manager or launch services.msc\n       and stop it there and then retry update.  If you recieve a trial\n       over message, close the window and manually launch\n       UpdateWizard.exe, this will start the update installation.\n\n       Finally make sure that TuneUp Utilities 2014 front end isn't\n       running, else shut it down (as stated above by stopping\n       TuneUp.UtilitiesSvc), and copy over the precracked dll from\n       the Crack folder, to the installed folder of TuneUp Utilities\n       2014.  Make sure to allow the file to be overwritten.  Now just\n       import the Registration.reg into your registry by double clicking\n       the file.\n\n       You now have a fully registered version of TuneUp Utilities 2014!\n       Appologies for this lengthy process, ever since AVG bought the\n       rights to this software, they are continually being lazy asses\n       and not updating the main setup download.\n       \n\n       OPTIONAL:\n\n       You can skip importing the registration file and use any info for\n       registration.  Its recommended to use the Registration file, as\n       this has account registration step completed for you and also\n       removes some previous blacklisting from lamer keygen onlys.  Use\n       a keygen only WILL ALWAYS result in blacklisting in a short time!\n       Make sure to use the following format for the serial:\n       XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX\n       or any 35 digits you'd like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
