It was meant to sell a book of muscle building techniques.\n\nMorrison turns this around into a homoerotic psychedelic mystery caper where Flex Mentallo has to save his creator, Wally Sage. Or is he a figment of Wally Sage's imagination concocted to save himself from a drug overdose?\n\nDigitally derived copy, not a scan.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abeb2e81f5f4772ca06cecc143da38d05614d0f7","amp;dn":"Flex+Mentallo+-+Man+of+Muscle+Mystery.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abeb2e81f5f4772ca06cecc143da38d05614d0f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,235,46,129,245,244,119,44,160,108,236,193,67,218,56,208,86,20,208,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
