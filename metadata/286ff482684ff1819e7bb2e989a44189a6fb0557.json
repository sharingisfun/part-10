When they landed their US recording contract, the company had them re-record for release on their label -- including the ubiquitous hit, WALKING ON SUNSHINE. For those who like that song but never heard the rest of their material, this album will be certain to give a whole new appreciation of the band.\n\nIncluded is a PDF of booklet which provides good history of their evolution.\n\n\nRipped with iTunes / FLAC via xAct 2.21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:286ff482684ff1819e7bb2e989a44189a6fb0557","amp;dn":"Katrina+and+the+Waves_+Original+Recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"286ff482684ff1819e7bb2e989a44189a6fb0557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,111,244,130,104,79,241,129,158,123,178,233,137,164,65,137,166,251,5,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
