Smith\nPaperback: 272 pages\nPublisher: Storey Publishing, LLC (January 1, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1580175562\nISBN-13: 978-1580175562\nFormat: PDF\nSize: 163 MB\n\nShiny green cucumbers; firm, juicy tomatoes; baby lettuces handpicked one salad at a time   these are the tasty benefits of the backyard vegetable garden. But earth gardens are a lot of work. They require a plot of plantable land and a significant time commitment to sowing, watering, weeding, and tending each plant.\n\nIs there a solution? Self-watering containers allow vegetable gardeners   from the casual weekender interested in a tomato plant or two to the very dedicated gardener with limited space   to grow richly producing plants in a controlled, low-maintenance environment.\n\nLifelong gardener Ed Smith became fascinated with the possibilities of self-watering containers and began testing dozens of vegetables in various containers, experimenting with nutrients, soil mixtures, plant varieties, and container positioning. Now Smith is here to tell gardeners that anyone can grow and enjoy wonderful organic vegetables, using pots with continuous- flow watering systems.\n\nSmith shares advice on choosing appropriate containers, how to provide balanced nutrition using his secret soil formula, and what additional tools benefit the container gardener. The reader will also find advice on starting from seed versus buying plants, which vegetables thrive in containers and which might be a bit more challenging, along with space-saving tips on pairing plants in single containers. After the last green tomato has been picked and is ripening on the windowsill, Smith wraps everything up with a chapter on fall clean-up and preparing for next spring. Now there   s really no excuse for store-bought tomatoes!\n\nIf you download our uploads, please make sure you seed them till atleast 1:1 ratio. We all work very hard to get this stuff. We'll all greatly appreciate some help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707f44ce97931eb1265a5b07e5b50e56748d2743","amp;dn":"Incredible+Vegetables+From+Self-Watering+Containers+%28PDF%29+Little","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707f44ce97931eb1265a5b07e5b50e56748d2743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,127,68,206,151,147,30,177,38,90,91,7,229,181,14,86,116,141,39,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
