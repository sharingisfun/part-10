Malick's films are also open to other angles, notably phenomenological, deconstructive, and Deleuzian approaches to film, all of which are evidenced in this collection. \n\nTerrence Malick: Film and Philosophy engages with Malick's body of work in distinct and independently significant ways: by looking at the tradition within which Malick works, the creative orientation of the filmmaker, and by discussing the ways in which criticism can illuminate these remarkable films.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd72ce65055979cefc5604bfcbdbcaf4bd2b0a0","amp;dn":"Terrence+Malick+-+Film+and+Philosophy+%28Tucker%2C+Kendall%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd72ce65055979cefc5604bfcbdbcaf4bd2b0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,215,44,230,80,85,151,156,239,197,96,75,252,189,188,175,75,210,176,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
