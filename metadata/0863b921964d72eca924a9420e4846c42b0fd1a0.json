This book addresses into a wide\nspectrum of topics associated with human genetics and genomics,\nincluding: Human origins; migrations and human population\ndiversity gained though genomic analyses.The complexities of\npsychiatric diseases that are influenced by genetics.\n\nThe pathogenesis of late-onset neurological diseases such as\nAlzheimer's, Parkinsonism, and ALS. Key aspects of protein\nmisfolding. Gene-environment interactions in DNA damage and\nrepair and DNA instability. Micro RNAs and mRNA translation.\nEpigenetics.
