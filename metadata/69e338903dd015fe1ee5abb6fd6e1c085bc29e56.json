'It turned out amazingly well, but I didn t want to commit to an entire album of classical music. What appealed to me instead was the idea of bringing together these seemingly contradictory sounds on different kinds of nonclassical music.'\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e338903dd015fe1ee5abb6fd6e1c085bc29e56","amp;dn":"Jeff+Beck+-+Emotion+And+Commotion+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e338903dd015fe1ee5abb6fd6e1c085bc29e56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,227,56,144,61,208,21,254,30,229,171,182,253,110,28,8,91,194,158,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
