It was released on November 2, 2010 on Broken Bow Records.\n\nAldean said that he chose the name of the album because he thought it was representative of &quot;what my fans have come to expect.&quot; He also said that it has a unique sound because he recorded it with his touring band and an engineer who does not work with any other artists.\n\nThe first single from My Kinda Party is the title track, which debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart at #41. The song has become Aldean's tenth Top 10 hit on that chart. The song also debuted at #54 on the Hot 100 chart. &quot;My Kinda Party&quot; was written and originally recorded by southern rock singer-songwriter Brantley Gilbert for his 2009 album Modern Day Prodigal Son.\n\nThe album also includes a duet with Kelly Clarkson called &quot;Don't You Wanna Stay&quot;, which debuted on the country charts from unsolicited airplay at #59 for the week of November 20, 2010. The song also debuted at #93 on the Hot 100 chart. Aldean and Clarkson performed this song at the 44th Annual CMA Awards on November 10, 2010.\n\nThis album also contains the country rap-themed &quot;Dirt Road Anthem&quot;, which was previously recorded separately by both of its writers, Brantley Gilbert and Colt Ford. According to The Boot, Aldean's publicist teased about this song, suggesting Aldean listened to &quot;a little Snoop Dogg in his time&quot;; regarding the song, Aldean said that he did not consider &quot;Dirt Road Anthem&quot; a rap song.\n\nJason Aldine Williams (born February 28, 1977 in Macon, Georgia) is an American country music singer, known professionally as Jason Aldean. He has recorded four albums on the independent Broken Bow Records label: Jason Aldean, Relentless, Wide Open, and My Kinda Party, in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010, respectively. These albums have accounted for eleven singles on the Billboard country singles charts, including the Number One hits &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;She's Country&quot;, &quot;Big Green Tractor&quot; and &quot;The Truth&quot;.\n\nKelly Brianne Clarkson (born April 24, 1982) is an American pop rock singer-songwriter and actress. Clarkson rose to fame after winning the first season of the television series American Idol in 2002 and would later represent the United States in the World Idol competition in 2003.\n\nClarkson has released four albums to date under RCA Records: her double-platinum debut album Thankful (2003), her multi-platinum second album Breakaway (2004) (which has won two Grammy Awards), My December (2007), and her latest album All I Ever Wanted (2009) (which was nominated for a Grammy Award). Her albums have sold over 10.5 million copies in the United States. Clarkson is the only American Idol contestant to have reached number one in the UK.
