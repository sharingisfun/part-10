Following the vastness of his world tour recently captured on Tripping the Live Fantastic, McCartney relished the opportunity to strip back his songs and appear on the newly-launched acoustic-only show. Consequently, McCartney was among the first in a long line of artists to release an unplugged album.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n\n01. Be-Bop-A-Lula\n02. I Lost My Little Girl\n03.
