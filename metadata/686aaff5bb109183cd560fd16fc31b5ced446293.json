During the Middle Ages these fortified structures were the ultimate authority in any region they were built. Both defensive and offensive, they were centres of administration, symbols of power as well as concentrations of military might. But what was it that made each successful? Through dynamic location footage and immersive visual effects, this six episode series reveals the bloody history behind these fortifications and the weapons designed to defeat them. Each episode will climax with the ultimate test of each castle's strength: examining the epic battle that changed the course of history.\n\n\n\n2)  Chateau Gaillard \nTowering above the River Seine, Chateau Gaillard was built by King Richard I to assert England's authority over his French holdings. Its multiple walls, deep moats and ingenious geometry were designed to terrify any foe. In 1203, a French king and his massive army lays siege, determined to push the English from the continent. Could its formidable defences repel the ambitions of Philip II, king of France?\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2092 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:686aaff5bb109183cd560fd16fc31b5ced446293","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Battle+Castle+with+Dan+Snow+2of6+Chateau+Gaillard+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"686aaff5bb109183cd560fd16fc31b5ced446293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,106,175,245,187,16,145,131,205,86,15,209,111,195,27,92,237,68,98,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
