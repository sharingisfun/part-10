Find out exactly what the &quot;true presence of Christ&quot; in the Eucharist really means, the foundations for Catholic teaching throughout the Bible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and much more. Rich May's riveting talk will not only provide you with a profound and adult understanding of the Eucharist, but is also sure to transform your relationship with Christ forever.\n\nRich May, a former Air Force pilot, is a retired engineer from Houston. With an advanced degree in Theology from the Franciscan University of Steubenville, he is an extremely popular speaker on a variety of Catholic topics. He has appeared on EWTN and hosts a live weekly radio program on Radio Maria. He is also a member of the Mariological Society of America and the Legion of Mary. more Ã‚Â»\n\nWe spent three years searching for the perfect talk, and here's why. Numerous polls confirm that belief in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist has decreased dramatically among practicing Catholics. Most Catholics lack even a rudimentary adult understanding of what the Church teaches. Rich May's riveting talk contains facts, theology, and Biblical insights into the Eucharist that even devout Catholics have never heard before.\n\nThe fact is, most Catholics have not received substantive teaching on this subject since their First Communion, while our Protestant brothers and sisters have been taught numernous falsehoods regarding this central reality of Catholicism for centuries. Only you can reach them, and the Eucharist Explained is the ideal tool for evangelizing your family, friends, and fellow parishioners. With your help, many will return to the sacraments while others will actually convert to Catholicism.
