It was Bowie's final studio album for the label and his first following the so-called Berlin Trilogy of Low, &quot;Heroes&quot; and Lodger (1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1979). Though considered significant in artistic terms, the trilogy had proved less successful commercially. With Scary Monsters, however, Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley called &quot;the perfect balance&quot;: as well as earning critical acclaim, the album peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom and restored Bowie's commercial standing in the United States.\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC+.cue (lossless)\n\nTracklist:\n1.
