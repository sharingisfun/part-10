For centuries since, she has been the object of debate, speculation, and the fascination so often accorded illustrious figures in history. Married in mere girlhood, this essentially lighthearted child was thrust onto the royal stage and commanded by circumstance to play a significant role in European history. Antonia Fraser's lavish and engaging portrait excites compassion and regard for all aspects of the queen, immersing the reader not only in the coming-of-age of a graceful woman, but in the culture of an unparalleled time and place.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf2ff1882121fd0b695df1391d5f243306f2e024","amp;dn":"Marie+Antoinette++-++Antonia+Fraser+++%28MOBI+%2F+ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf2ff1882121fd0b695df1391d5f243306f2e024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,47,241,136,33,33,253,11,105,93,241,57,29,95,36,51,6,242,224,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
