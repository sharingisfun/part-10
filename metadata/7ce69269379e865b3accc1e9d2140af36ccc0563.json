In Cleese's very own words: &quot;it is an \nevening of well honed anecdotes, psychoanalytical \ntit-bits and unprovoked attacks on former colleagues, \nespecially Michael Palin.&quot; \n\nCleese has achieved a lot in his career which \nstarted as a sketch writer for BBC Radio's Dick \nEmery Show and then The Frost Report. After this \nstardom beckoned, and Monty Python was created \nwith Cleese co-writing and starring in four \nseries and three films. He went on to achieve \nfurther great success as the neurotic hotel \nmanager Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he \nco-wrote with then wife Connie Booth. After huge \nUK success John went on to crack the USA with A \nFish Called Wanda (which he wrote and starred in \nwith Jamie Lee Curtis). The late 1990s saw the \nunstoppable Mr Cleese appear in Bond movie The World \nis Not Enough and later Die Another Day. From writing \nto starring in plays, musicals, theatrical and comedy \nproductions, to films and sitcoms, Cleese has done it all, \nand now it's time for him to tell you about his \njam-packed life.\n\n[Clan]\n\nLookin fae: 100mbit+ eu affils, uk [ph]dtv cappers, retai","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce69269379e865b3accc1e9d2140af36ccc0563","amp;dn":"John.Cleese.The.Alimony.Tour.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce69269379e865b3accc1e9d2140af36ccc0563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,230,146,105,55,158,134,91,58,204,193,233,210,20,10,243,108,204,5,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
