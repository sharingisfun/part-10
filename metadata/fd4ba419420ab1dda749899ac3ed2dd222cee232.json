Dillmann et al. (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book presents contributions to the 19th biannual symposium of the German Aerospace Aerodynamics Association (STAB) and the German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics (DGLR). The individual chapters reflect ongoing research conducted by the STAB members in the field of numerical and experimental fluid mechanics and aerodynamics, mainly for (but not limited to) aerospace applications, and cover both nationally and EC-funded projects. Special emphasis is given to collaborative research projects conducted by German scientists and engineers from universities, research-establishments and industries. By addressing a number of cutting-edge applications, together with the relevant physical and mathematics fundamentals, the book provides readers with a comprehensive overview of the current research work in the field. Though the bookâ€™s primary emphasis is on the aerospace context, it also addresses further important applications, e.g. in ground transportation and energy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd4ba419420ab1dda749899ac3ed2dd222cee232","amp;dn":"New+Results+in+Numerical+and+Experimental+Fluid+Mechanics+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd4ba419420ab1dda749899ac3ed2dd222cee232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,75,164,25,66,10,177,221,167,73,137,154,195,237,45,210,34,206,226,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
