It portrays the conspiracy against the Roman dictator of the same name, his assassination and its aftermath. It is one of several Roman plays that he wrote, based on true events from Roman history, which also include Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra.\n\nAlthough the title of the play is Julius Caesar, Caesar is not the central character in its action; he appears in only three scenes, and is killed at the beginning of the third act. The protagonist of the play is Marcus Brutus, and the central psychological drama is his struggle between the conflicting demands of honour, patriotism, and friendship.\n\nThe play reflected the general anxiety of England over the succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to that of Rome might break out after her death.\n\n\n\n\nCAST:\n\nNicholas Farrell (Brutus)\nSamantha Bond (Portia)\nGerard Murphy (Julius Caesar)\nStella Gonet (Calpurnia)\nJonathan Firth (Mark Anthony)\nColin McFarlane (Cassius)\nNikolas Grace (Casca)\nHugh Ross (Decius)\nJohn Rowe (Trebonius)\nIan Pepperl (Metellus Cimber)\nJohn McAndrew (Cinna)\nSean Baker (Caius Ligarius)\nIan Jeffes (Octavius Caesar)\n\nDirected by Eoin O'Callaghan\n\nFirst broadcast on BBC Radio 3, 26 September 1999\n\n\n\n\nType: mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate: 128 kbps\nMode: joint stereo\nFrequency: 44.100 kHz\nLength: 2 hrs, 21 mins\nEncoder: Unknown.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:354e2dc27a03bc97393163e64d77f07dd0ecf5cf","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+Julius+Caesar++%28BBC+Radio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"354e2dc27a03bc97393163e64d77f07dd0ecf5cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,78,45,194,122,3,188,151,57,49,99,230,77,119,240,125,208,236,245,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
