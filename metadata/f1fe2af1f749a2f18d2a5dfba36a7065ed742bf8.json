He helped to raise global awareness of the gulag and the Soviet Union's forced labour camp system. While his writings were often suppressed, he wrote many books, most notably The Gulag Archipelago, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and Two Hundred Years Together. Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970, &quot;for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature&quot;. He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 but returned to Russia in 1994 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in PDF format:\n\n*  AUGUST 1914\n\n*  CANCER WARD\n\n*  IN THE FIRST CIRCLE\n\n*  ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF IVAN DENISOVICH\n\n*  THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO\n\nRead the article, interviews, and Seed the torrent!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0172.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0172.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/solz-interview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/solz-interview.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fe2af1f749a2f18d2a5dfba36a7065ed742bf8","amp;dn":"Aleksandr+Solzhenitsyn+-+5+Books+%28Nobel+Prize+in+Literature%2C+197","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fe2af1f749a2f18d2a5dfba36a7065ed742bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,254,42,241,247,73,162,241,141,42,93,251,163,106,112,101,237,116,43,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
