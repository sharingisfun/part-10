Sting first rose to fame as part of the legendary rock group The Police in the 1970s and 1980s before becoming a successful solo artist. He earned his unusual nickname from the black and yellow sweater he used to wear during his early days as a musician.\nSting played with several groups before forming The Police with drummer Stewart Copeland and guitarist Henri Padovani in 1977. Padovani was later replaced by guitarist Andy Summers. The new trio released the single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoxanneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the spring of 1978, which went nowhere at first. Later that year, Sting, Copeland, and Summers traveled around the United States in a van playing small clubs, such as CBGBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, a punk rock haven in New York City. Interest in their first album Outlandos dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Amour (1978) began to grow and it eventually made on to first the British and then the American charts. A re-released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoxanneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as well as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo LonelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Stand Losing YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ became popular singles. Sting wrote most of the songs on the album, as he would for most of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recordings. Also during this time, he made his first film appearance in musical drama Quadrophenia (1978).\nWhile often identified as part of the punk and new wave musical scenes, The Police had a sound that was hard to pin down, filled with many influences from jazz to progressive rock. With its unique sound, the group continued to attract new fans with its second album Reggatta de Blanc (1979). While Sting wrote the two biggest singles on the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMessage in a BottleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalking on the Moon,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it was the instrumental composition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReggatta de BlancÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ created by all of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s members that won them their first Grammy Award in 1980 for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\nTheir next album helped cement The PoliceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s position as a leading rock act. Zenyatta Mondatta (1980) featured such hits as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Stand So Close to MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDe Do Do Do, De Da Da Da.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The group toured extensively around this time, but still managed to release another album the following year. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvery Little Thing She Does Is MagicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Ghost in the Machine (1981) reached the top of the charts.\nAlso during this time, Sting tackled his first leading role in the 1982 film Brimstone and Treacle. He even contributed to the score and wrote a song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpread a Little Happiness,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for the soundtrack, which became a solo hit for him. The Police regrouped for one more studio album, 1983ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Synchronicity. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvery Breath You TakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ climbed to the top of the American and British charts. While many have viewed the song as romantic, it is actually a tale of obsessive love. After the tour to support this album ended in 1984, Sting decided that the group should take a break.Sting began a career as a solo artist, scoring a hit album with his first post-Police effort, The Dream of the Blue Turtles (1985). On the recording, he worked with several jazz musicians, including Bradford Marsalis. Sting went on to release a string of successful solo albums, including Nothing Like the Sun (1987), The Soul Cages (1991), Ten SummonerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tales (1993), and Mercury Falling (1996). During this period, Sting wrote and recorded a diverse range of music, from haunting ballads to intriguing instrumental pieces to upbeat popular songs. He found chart success with such singles as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEnglishman in New York,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf I Ever Lose My Faith in You,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFields of Gold.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nAlong with his musical exploration and experimentation, Sting found time for acting. He appeared in several films, including the science fiction drama Dune (1984) and the popular British crime film Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). He worked on soundtracks for such films as The Mighty (1998), The Thomas Crown Affair (1999), and The EmperorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New Groove (2000).\nIn 1999, Sting released his most popular solo album to date, Brand New Day. The optimistic title track strung a cord with listeners around the world and won Sting a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 2000. Later albums include All This Time (2001), Sacred Love (2003), and Songs from the Labyrinth (2006), which is a recording of English music from the 1600s.\nIn 2007, Sting surprised and delighted fans of The Police when the group performed together on the Grammy Awards television broadcast. The band also announced it would tour for the first time in over two decades.\nIn addition to his musical career, Sting has been active in human rights and other social issues. He and his wife Trudie Styler have been married since 1992. The couple has four children. He has two other children from his first marriage.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review\n\nIn All This Time Sting performs in Italy in front of a select, sympathetic audience drawn from his fan club. As often in recent years, he revisits much old material, often radically recasting it. Such classics as &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Stand So Close To Me&quot;, originally notable for their energy and attack, have mellowed with age, acquiring some new chords, stripped down instrumentation and a rhapsodic, lyrical character. Some may miss the old vitality, but elsewhere Sting hits harder with a loose-limbed Afro-Cuban reading of &quot;Set Them Free&quot;, a slamming &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; and the shuffling boogie of &quot;Brand New Day&quot;. As ever, Sting&amp;#039;s soft spot for jazz, always evident in the sophistication of his writing, is given flesh in his top-drawer sidemen, among them Christian McBride, Chris Botti and England&amp;#039;s own Jason Rebello. Jazz also leads him to turn &quot;Roxanne&quot; into a low-down medium swinger with a beautifully gravelly and sadly short-lived trombone solo from Clark Gayton. There are times when Sting&amp;#039;s voice is perhaps over-stretched (when for example he affects an Armstrong-like growl in &quot;Moon Over Bourbon Street&quot;) and there&amp;#039;s a sense of tokenism in the too-brief glimpses of his talented sidemen, but the delighted audience on this balmy Tuscan evening show no sign of dissent.\n\nEnjoy.
