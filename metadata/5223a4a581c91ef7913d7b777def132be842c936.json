Pulkrabek &quot;Engineering Fundamentals of the Internal Combustion Engine&quot;\nPublished by Prentice Hall | Publication date : March 1997 | ISBN: 0135708540 | PDF | 426 pages | English \n\nThis applied thermoscience book covers the basic principles and applications of various types of internal combustion engines. Explores the fundamentals of most types of internal combustion engines with a major emphasis on reciprocating engines. Covers both spark ignition and compression ignition engines as well as those operating on four-stroke cycles and on two-stroke cycles ranging in size from small model airplane engines to the larger stationary engines. Examines recent advancements, such as, Miller cycle analysis, lean burn engines, 2-stroke cycle automobile engines, variable valve timing, and thermal storage.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5223a4a581c91ef7913d7b777def132be842c936","amp;dn":"Engineering+Fundamentals+of+the+Internal+Combustion+Engine+-+%28Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5223a4a581c91ef7913d7b777def132be842c936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,35,164,165,129,201,30,247,145,61,123,119,125,239,19,43,232,66,201,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
