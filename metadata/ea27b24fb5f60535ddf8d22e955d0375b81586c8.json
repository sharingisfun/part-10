This important volume compiles today's best research on the often-overlooked topic of prereader comprehension: what we know about it now, and what we need to know to build a stronger foundation for childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future reading skills. More than two dozen literacy experts clearly describe theoretical models of early comprehension, demystify current research, recommend effective practices for boosting comprehension, and identify critical research priorities for the near future. An essential text and reference for reading specialists, program administrators, SLPs, preservice professionals, and researchers, this volume is key to helping children develop the early comprehension skills that support later reading success.\n\nKEY TOPICS COVERED:\nthe importance of teaching all young children comprehension strategies\nconnections between vocabulary development and listening comprehension\nthe relationship of academic talk to reading comprehension\nhow social pretend play helps children cultivate skills essential for comprehension\ndevelopment of executive function skills important for academic success assessment of comprehension skills in prereaders\nhow young children become literate in a digital society\nthe benefits of using academic talk and informational texts in pre-K classrooms\nways to support early comprehension for multilingual students and those with special needs\nparentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and teachersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ complementary roles in developing childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comprehension","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea27b24fb5f60535ddf8d22e955d0375b81586c8","amp;dn":"Developing+Early+Comprehension+DeBruin-Parecki+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D%7BHT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea27b24fb5f60535ddf8d22e955d0375b81586c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,39,178,79,181,246,5,53,221,248,210,46,149,93,3,117,184,21,134,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
