The band was formed in Spartanburg, SC, in 1971 by singer Doug Gray, guitarist Caldwell (born 1948, died February 25, 1993), his brother bassist Tommy Caldwell (born 1950, died April 4, 1980), guitarist George McCorkle, drummer Paul Riddle, and reed player Jerry Eubanks. The six-piece group was signed to Capricorn Records and released their debut album, The Marshall Tucker Band, in March 1973. They gained recognition through a tour with the Allman Brothers Band and found significant success during the course of the '70s, with most of their albums going gold. Their peak came with the million-selling album Carolina Dreams and its Top 15 single &quot;Heard It in a Love Song&quot; in 1977.\n\n\nGenre................: Southern Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Take The Highway\n02.Can't You See (45 Version)\n03.Hillbilly Band\n04.See You Later, I'm Gone\n05.A New Life\n06.Blue Ridge Mountain Sky\n07.Another Cruel Love\n08.This Ol' Cowboy (45 Version)\n09.In My Own Way\n10.Where A Country Boy Belongs\n11.Try One More Time\n12.Ramblin' (Live)\n13.24 Hours At A Time (Live)\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Fire On The Mountain\n02.Searchin' For A Rainbow (45 Version)\n03.Walkin' And Talkin'\n04.Virginia\n05.Bob Away My Blues\n06.Can't You See (Live)\n07.Long Hard Ride (45 Version)\n08.Am I The Kind Of Man\n09.You Say You Love Me\n10.Fly Like An Eagle\n11.Heard It In A Love Song (45 Version)\n12.Desert Skies\n13.I'll Be Loving You\n14.Dream Lover\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f88785f7283011a82ada2f78b5902f8f1746d3a8","amp;dn":"Marshall+Tucker+Band+-+Best+Of+%281994%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f88785f7283011a82ada2f78b5902f8f1746d3a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,135,133,247,40,48,17,168,42,218,47,120,181,144,47,143,23,70,211,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
