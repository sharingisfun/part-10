Formed in 1986 by guitarist and band leader Russ Freeman (not to be confused with the jazz pianist of the same name), their career has spanned two decades. With a revolving door of musicians, Freeman has been the only consistent member.\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s they were closer to a jazz/rock instrumental band, but since 1999 they have developed into the smooth jazz genre. Many of their songs have also been played during The Weather Channel's local on the 8's forecast segments. The band's mascot is a blue, smiling, sunglasses-wearing, jazz cat which appears in the artwork of all the band's releases and on their official website.\n\n\nMore info &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rippingtons\n\nListen song Sahara &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\nHere is almost complete The Rippingtons discography (without albums Moonlighting - 1986, CÃƒÂ´te D'Azur - 2011 and Built To Last - 2012):\n\n1988 - Kilimanjaro\n1989 - Tourist in Paradise\n1999 - Welcome to the St. James's Club\n1991 - Curves Ahead\n1992 - Weekend in Monaco\n1994 - Sahara\n1996 - Brave New World\n1997 - Black Diamond\n1999 - Topaz\n2000 - Life in Tropics\n2003 - Let It Ripp\n2005 - Wild Card\n2006 - 20th Anniversary\n2009 -Modern Art\n\nTwo live albums:\n\n1993 - Live in L.A.\n2002 - Live Across America\n\nand compilation:\n\n1997 - The Best of The Rippingtons\n\n\nPLEASE SEED THIS QUALITY MUSIC!
