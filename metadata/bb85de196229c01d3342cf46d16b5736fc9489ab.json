It can also do this with your LiveCD.\n\nYou don't have to worry about scratches on the disc or misplacing your original media discs once you transfer their contents to the flash drive. The optical drive is quickly becoming a thing of the past, especially in office environments, as media is shifted to the cloud.\n\n=====================================================\n\nScanned by kaspersky internet security 2011, no threats detected...\n\n=====================================================\n\nPlease seed as much as you can...\n\n=====================================================\n\nPlease write comments...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb85de196229c01d3342cf46d16b5736fc9489ab","amp;dn":"Novicorp+WintoFlash+0.7.0009+beta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb85de196229c01d3342cf46d16b5736fc9489ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,133,222,25,98,41,192,29,51,66,207,70,209,107,87,54,252,148,137,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
