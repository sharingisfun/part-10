Ron Hubbard\nYear: 1982\nFormat: .MP3\nBitrate: 128 kbps\nTotal tracks: 177\n\nBattlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 is now better remembered for the film adaptation, released in 2000, that was a commercial failure and was criticized as one of the &quot;worst films ever made&quot;. Don't blame the book, however, which is well regarded in sci-fi circles.\n \nIn the year 3000, man is an endangered species at the mercy of a space-plundering race of nine-foot-tall, gas-breathing alien conquerors from the planet Psychlo. Against terrific odds, the remnants of humanity have engaged in a desperate and grueling battle for Earth against the alien oppressors--and so begins this epic adventure that surges across the Earth and explosively ignites across the galaxies of an alien empire ... to become the gripping tale that has kept countless readers enthralled for the past two decades.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388a157524773e4eb5a2a6158c6efc37297ab7e9","amp;dn":"Battlefield+Earth+-+L+Ron+Hubbard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388a157524773e4eb5a2a6158c6efc37297ab7e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,138,21,117,36,119,62,78,181,162,166,21,140,110,252,55,41,122,183,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
