Now let knitwear designer Lorna Miser share the many blessings that knitting has brought to her life, through stories, patterns and memories. A lifelong knitter, Lorna's hobby has created much more than simple hats and scarves. By knitting wherever she goes, she has met interesting people, had amazing experiences and made wonderful friends. Her inspiring stories, each one evoked by an accompanying pattern, encourage readers to recognise the gifts they have received in life. Each tale, from the humorous (teaching a troop of Girl Scouts to knit) to the poignant (making a new friend while visiting a friend in hospice care) reveals how knitting can spread joy, lead to moments of connection and self-discovery and give all of us opportunities to share love and kindness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389d725adf648a82791ce7282ee13b98fe28e811","amp;dn":"Lorna+Miser+-+Faith%2C+Hope%2C+Love+Knitting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389d725adf648a82791ce7282ee13b98fe28e811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,157,114,90,223,100,138,130,121,28,231,40,46,225,59,152,254,40,232,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
