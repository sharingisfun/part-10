ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if it fits, but I like the way it feels.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nUnexpected and utterly sublime, this sultry song cycle will shuffle seamlessly in tandem with Getz/Gilberto and Graceland, albums as boldly surprising in their eras as El Turista is in this one. The record marks a new direction for the critically acclaimed cult artist, while offering the musical sophistication and emotional depth RouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s devoted constituents have come to expect from him thanks to a consistently enthralling body of work highlighted by the modern-day landmarks 1972 (2003) and Nashville (2005), both of which are generously sampled on the marvelous 2008 Rhino retrospective The Best of the Rykodisc years.\n\n\n\nThe new album bears the distinct influence of Spain, which the Nebraska native made his home five years ago with his Spanish wife Paz Suay; the couple and their first child now live in Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast. On El Turista, Spain serves as the point of origin for a globe-trotting musical journey that touches down in Cuba, Brazil and Africa, as well as Nashville, where the bulk of the tracks were recorded with RouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longtime producer and close collaborator Brad Jones, and the coupleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former home of Brooklyn, where the seeds of the record where sown and some of the songs dreamed up. \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Bienvenido\n02 - Duerme\n03 - Lemon Tree\n04 - Sweet Elaine\n05 - Mesie Julian\n06 - I Will Live On Islands\n07 - Valencia\n08 - Cotton Eye Joe\n09 - Las Voces\n10 - DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Act Tough\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO SEED FOR OTHERS!!\nTHANKS!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b3e436c728306cf12a3613c34571bb3aba74c8","amp;dn":"Josh+Rouse+-+El+Turista+%282010%29%28Indie+Folk+Alternative+Country%29%28V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b3e436c728306cf12a3613c34571bb3aba74c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,179,228,54,199,40,48,108,241,42,54,19,195,69,113,187,58,186,116,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
