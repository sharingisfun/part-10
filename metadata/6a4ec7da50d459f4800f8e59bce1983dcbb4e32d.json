Pulitzer Prize and AudioFile Earphones Award. Newly re-recorded.\n\nThis great classic tells the story of peasant Wang Lung - of the family he founded, of its rise to dynasty; of the gods he implored, of the earth that sustained him, and of the land he made to prosper against the ravages of nature and the attacks of man. Wang Lung was awed by the rich and decadent ways of the Hwang family, from which he originally got his wife, O-Lan. Later, these ways come back to haunt him, for when he becomes rich and powerful, he loses reverence for the land, and his sons are resolved to sell it on his death. Like the land itself, the fortunes of men are cyclical. \n\n- - -\n\nSet in pre-Revolutionary China, The Good Earth is the poignant story of Wang Lung, a rice farmer whose industry and commitment to the land enable him and his family to prosper. But unexpected drought forces the family south in search of food, and there they suffer the spiritual impoverishment of life in the city. Wang LungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s courageous journey back to his farm is a spiritual affirmation of the values of the land.\n\nAwards:\n - Pulitzer Prize Winner\n - Nobel Prize-winning author\n - OprahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Book Club Selection\n - AudioFile Earphones Award\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4ec7da50d459f4800f8e59bce1983dcbb4e32d","amp;dn":"THE+GOOD+EARTH+-+Pearl+S.+Buck.+Read+by+Kate+Reading+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4ec7da50d459f4800f8e59bce1983dcbb4e32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,78,199,218,80,212,89,244,128,15,142,89,188,225,152,61,203,180,227,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
