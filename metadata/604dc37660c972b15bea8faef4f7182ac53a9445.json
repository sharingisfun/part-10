Lang's music is notable for both his unusual voice, which has been compared to that of a 40-year-old blues veteran, and for his guitar solos. His solo patterns have especially been noted for his frequent use of wide vibratos.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLie to Me is the second studio album by American blues guitarist Jonny Lang, released on January 28, 1996. This is Lang's big-label debut, released a day before he turned 16. This is after the independently-released Smokin, released in 1995.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:604dc37660c972b15bea8faef4f7182ac53a9445","amp;dn":"Jonny+Lang+-+Lie+To+Me+%5B1996%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"604dc37660c972b15bea8faef4f7182ac53a9445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,77,195,118,96,201,114,177,91,234,143,174,244,247,24,42,197,58,148,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
