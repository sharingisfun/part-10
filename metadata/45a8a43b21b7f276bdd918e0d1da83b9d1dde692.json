He is Morpheus, the lord of story. Older than humankind itself, he inhabits - along with Destiny, Death, Destruction, Desire, Despair, and Delirium, his Endless sisters and brothers - the realm of human consciousness. His powers are myth and nightmare - inspirations, pleasures, and punishments manifested beneath the blanketing mist of sleep.\n\nSurrender to him now.\n\nA stunning collection of visions, wonders, horrors, hallucinations, and revelations from Clive Barker, Frank McConnell, Colin Greenland, John M Ford, Lisa Goldstein, Barbara Hambly, BW Clough, Will Shetterly, George Alec Effinger, Caitlain R Kiernan, Robert Rodi, Tad Williams, Lawrence Schimel, Mark Kreighbaum, Karen Haber, Delia Sherman, Nancy A Collins, Gene Wolfe, Steven Brust, Susanna Clark and Tori Amos. Inspired by the groundbreaking, bestselling graphic novel phenomenon by Neil Gaiman.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a8a43b21b7f276bdd918e0d1da83b9d1dde692","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman+and+Ed+Kramer+-+The+Sandman+Book+Of+Dreams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a8a43b21b7f276bdd918e0d1da83b9d1dde692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,168,164,59,33,183,242,118,189,217,24,224,209,218,131,185,209,221,230,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
