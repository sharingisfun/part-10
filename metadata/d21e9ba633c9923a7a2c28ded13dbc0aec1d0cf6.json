As in the provocative, yet hauntingly beautiful, Portrait of Jeanne KÃƒÂ©fer that is the focus of this book, he frequently posed his models leaning against a closed door, flattening the space and resulting in a meditative, hermetically sealed image. Jeanne KÃƒÂ©fer was the daughter of a composer-friend of the artist, and Khnopff deftly captures the childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vulnerability to the outside world in the small gesture of her tiny thumb catching the edge of her bow.\nThe book places this painting in the historical context of KhnopffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s times and social milieu and traces the advent of Symbolism as a literary and artistic movement. An analysis of the portrait itself is supported by a stunning array of related paintings, details, and technical photographs. Finally, the author uses KhnopffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portraits as a taking-off point for a broader discussion of Symbolist art.\nFernand Khnopff: Portrait of Jeanne KÃƒÂ©fer is part of the Getty Museum Studies on Art series, which is designed to introduce individual artworks or small groups of related works to a broad public with an interest in the history of art. Each monograph is written by a leading scholar and features a close discussion of its subject as well as a detailed analysis of the broader historical and cultural context in which the work was created.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d21e9ba633c9923a7a2c28ded13dbc0aec1d0cf6","amp;dn":"Portrait+of+Jeanne+Kefer+%28Art+Painting+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d21e9ba633c9923a7a2c28ded13dbc0aec1d0cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,30,155,166,51,201,146,58,122,44,40,222,209,61,188,10,236,29,12,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
