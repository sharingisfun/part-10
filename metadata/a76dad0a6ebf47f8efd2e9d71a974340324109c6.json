Between 1959 and 1967 the couple wrote some of the most enduring hits of all time, including 'Will You Love Me Tomorrow',  \n'Take Good Care Of My Baby', 'Goin' Back', 'The Loco-Motion' and 'It Might As Well Rain Until September'. Those songs have been anthologised hundreds of\ntimes - maybe thousands. Now it's time to shine the spotlight on other great G &amp; K songs that haven't always received the attention they deserve. \nThis collection blends hits and hard-to-find classics, focusing primarily on the latter but also including the original versions of songs that will have many listeners thinking, &quot;I didn't realise they wrote that!&quot; \n\nMany of these tracks are completely new to CD, and several have never been reissued in any format in 40 years.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Goffin-King-Carole-Collection-1961-1967/dp/B000UX43Y6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Goffin-King-Carole-Collection-1961-1967/dp/B000UX43Y6&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Goffin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Goffin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVarious artists - Goffin &amp; King  A Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King Song Collection 1961 - 1967\nThis compilation 2007\n\n01  The Tokens - He's In Town\n02  Skeeter Davis - Let Me Get Close To You\n03  Tony Orlando - Halfway To Paradise\n04  Bobby Vee - The Idol\n05  The Chiffons - The First And Last\n06  Richard 'Popcorn' Wylie - Brand New Man\n07  The Drifters - Another Night With The Boys\n08  Jackie DeShannon - Heaven Is Being With You\n09  Satisfactions - I Don't Have Any Summer Romance\n10  Bertell Dache - Love Eyes\n11  The Crickets - Don't Ever Change\n12  Jill Jackson - I'll Love You For A While\n13  Lenny Welch - I Was There\n14  Bobby Rydell - I Just Can't Say Goodbye\n15  Betty Everett - I Can't Hear You\n16  Donna Loren - Just A Little Girl\n17  The Everly Brothers - You're Just What I Was Looking For Today\n18  Ramona King - Hey Everybody\n19  P.J.
