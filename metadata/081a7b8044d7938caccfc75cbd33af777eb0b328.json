This is the first (and only) film to truly shed light on a movement that has heretofore been shrouded in darkness and rumor and obscured by inaccurate and shallow depictions. Featuring exclusive interviews and veritÃƒÂ© with the musicians, a wealth of rare, seldom seen footage from the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;s earliest days, Until the Light Takes Us explores every aspect of the controversial movement that has captured the attention of the world. This is the movie that gets inside the minds and hearts of black metal's musicians. The filmmakers moved to Norway, living and filming there for two years. The movie is not about them though - it's about the extraordinary people and events that make black metal unique, unforgettable, and inevitable. This is black metal as seen through the eyes of those who created it, of those who live it, of those who are at the center of the story of black metal.\n\nFeaturing:\nFenriz\nVarg Vikernes\nHellhammer\nFrost\nAbbath\nDemonaz\nBjarne Melgaard (artist)\nHarmony Korine (director of Gummo, whose soundtrack included black metal and sludge)\n\nSpecial Features:\n36 minute Black Metal short film of deleted scenes\nAlternate Ending\nOuttakes\n\nThe Cutting Room with musicians not in the film including:\nEnslaved\nNocturno Culto\nNecrobutcher\n\nplus more with:\nUlver\nImmortal\nHellhammer\nFenriz\nFrost\n\n46 more minutes of Varg Vikernes\n\nand a 45 minute class on the history of black metal with Fenriz\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter from the actual 2xDVD.\nNTSC.\nRegion 1 &amp; 4.\n1.78 : 1  Widescreen\nIn English with English/Spanish/French subtitles\n\n93 minutes + 242 minutes of extras","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081a7b8044d7938caccfc75cbd33af777eb0b328","amp;dn":"Until+The+Light+Takes+Us+%282DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081a7b8044d7938caccfc75cbd33af777eb0b328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,26,123,128,68,215,147,140,172,207,199,92,189,51,175,119,126,176,179,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
