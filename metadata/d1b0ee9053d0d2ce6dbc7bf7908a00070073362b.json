John travels to court houses and one of Robert Johnsons girl friends gets to hear a Recording of Robert Johnson for the first time!! John also finds a possible son and grandson of Robert Johnson.\n\nI give this Recording about a B plus. I recorded this several years ago on to V.H.S. and used the Standard Video Recording of the time and kept this Video put up and forgot that I had it. I transfered it on a new home unit D.V.D. recorder that I am trying to learn how to use!!\n\nIn the past I have uploaded some Roy Buchanan and Rory Gallagher but I thought I would give this Historical piece a shot! There are no Commercials in this and I recorded it off of a Sattelite. Thanks, Rick from Roy Buchanans HUB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1b0ee9053d0d2ce6dbc7bf7908a00070073362b","amp;dn":"THE+SEARCH+FOR+ROBERT+JOHNSON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1b0ee9053d0d2ce6dbc7bf7908a00070073362b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,176,238,144,83,208,210,206,109,188,123,247,144,138,0,7,0,115,54,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
