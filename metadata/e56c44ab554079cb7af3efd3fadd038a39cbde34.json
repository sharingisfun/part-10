In The Black Hole War, Susskind plays on our insatiable appetite for the gee-whiz moment, combining lucid explanations for some complex ideas with stories that tend to confirm the eccentricities of the highly intelligent.

And, of course, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never a bad idea to drop HawkingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name in a bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title.
