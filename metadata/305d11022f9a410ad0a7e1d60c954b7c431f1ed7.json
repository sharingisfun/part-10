After all, not everyone's life is moon, June, and honeymoon. Two of the finest examples of the Willie way are on this album: &quot;I'm A Memory&quot; and, especially, &quot;What Can You Do to Me Now?&quot; By his standards, this isn't good enough to be called a classic album, but it would still blow many other artists out of the water.\n\n/Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:305d11022f9a410ad0a7e1d60c954b7c431f1ed7","amp;dn":"Willie+Nelson+-+Willie+Nelson+and+Family+%281971%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"305d11022f9a410ad0a7e1d60c954b7c431f1ed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,93,17,2,47,154,65,10,208,167,225,214,12,149,75,124,67,31,30,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
