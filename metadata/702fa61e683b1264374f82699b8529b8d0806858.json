The second Nassau Coliseum show 3/29/90 has already been uploaded under the name &quot;Grateful Dead - Wake Up to Find Out Nassau Coliseum 1990 (2014) FLAC Beolab1700&quot; So I won't be bothering doing that one again. As of time of posting I'm still putting this together and plan on doing the MP3 version of the complete Box set at some point... its all work, work, work...  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8 complete shows on 23 discs\n3/14/90 Capital Centre, Landover, MD\n3/18/90 Civic Center, Hartford, CT\n3/21/90 Copps Coliseum, Hamilton, Ontario\n3/25/90 Knickerbocker Arena, Albany, NY\n3/28/90 Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY\n3/29/90 Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY (featuring Branford Marsalis)\n4/1/90 The Omni, Atlanta, GA\n4/3/90 The Omni, Atlanta, GA\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2012 the Grateful Dead released Spring 1990, an 18-CD box set containing live performances recorded during the legendary San Francisco actÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three-week, 25th anniversary tour. On September 9 the band follow-up that box set with the release of Spring 1990 (The Other One) featuring 23-CDs worth of music from that same tour.\nThe music on the box set was recorded by long-time Grateful Dead audio engineer John Cutler and mixed from the master 24-track analog tapes by Jeffrey Norman at Bob WeirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TRI Studios. David Glasser then mastered the music to HDCD specs.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When we produced the first Spring 1990 box in 2012, there were a lot of tough choices to make about what shows to omit from that box. However, we knew weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d do this second box someday, so the choices of omission were easier to digest,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Grateful Dead archivist David Lemieux in a press release. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able to complete the picture the first box painted with music thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every bit as good, and in some cases surpasses, the six shows in the original box. These are eight extremely high- level Dead shows, each and every one of which would make a terrific CD releases. It only seemed fitting that in the face of such an abundance of quality Dead, we should release it all at once.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dead.net/store/1990s/spring-1990-other-one-box&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dead.net/store/1990s/spring-1990-other-one-box&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:702fa61e683b1264374f82699b8529b8d0806858","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Box+Set+The+Other+One+3-14-90+Capital+Centre+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"702fa61e683b1264374f82699b8529b8d0806858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,47,166,30,104,59,18,100,55,79,130,105,155,133,41,184,208,128,104,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
