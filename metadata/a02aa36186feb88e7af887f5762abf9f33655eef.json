I'm not sure if the female voice is part of the track or not, but transparently removing it seems not feasibly possible.\n\nThe best versions of the tracks I discovered were used, but they were MP3s; as such this MP3 can be considered transcoded. I'm not aware of any lossless release of this song, so it is what it is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a02aa36186feb88e7af887f5762abf9f33655eef","amp;dn":"Rocko+-+U.O.E.N.O.+%28Tootie+Single+Edit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a02aa36186feb88e7af887f5762abf9f33655eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,42,163,97,134,254,184,142,122,248,135,245,118,42,191,159,51,101,94,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
