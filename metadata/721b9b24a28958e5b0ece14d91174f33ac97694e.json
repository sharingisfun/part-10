Regular TV programming has fazed out Bugs Bunny cartoons. Great video compliations are out-of-print. And if you don&amp;#039;t have cable TV, you&amp;#039;re screwed.\n\nIt edits the original shorts with new linking material, which is not a new practice. Robert Youngson made a career out of this genre; his titles include &quot;4 Clowns&quot; and &quot;Laurel and Hardy&amp;#039;s Laughing 20s&quot;. Also, the MGM That&amp;#039;s Entertainment! series, which is up to three. Most critics tend to praise those titles, but condemn the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes films.\n\nThat is not fair. &quot;1001 Rabbit Tales&quot; is a very good movie on its&amp;#039; own terms. Supervised by the late, great Friz Freleng, the linking material is the best so far in this series. The &quot;plot&quot; involves Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck as salesmen for Rambling House Publishing (a great in-joke that&amp;#039;s just one of many). They go their separate ways and Bugs ends up being a storyteller for Yosemite Sam&amp;#039;s son (this is where the old cartoons enter in)\n\nFreleng selects some of the very best Looney Tunes shorts for this film. His selections include &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot;, one of the greatest of all time and &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Cats&quot; (featuring Sylvester Jr.) and his editing is seamless this time round, unlike previous entries where it looked more obvious. \n\nThose critics who feel obliged to hate a film like this can go back on the horse they rode in on. Even Maltin thought it was decent at 2 1/2 stars. This is wonderful entertainment and considering today&amp;#039;s entertainment, timeless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721b9b24a28958e5b0ece14d91174f33ac97694e","amp;dn":"Bugs+Bunny%5C%27s+3rd+Movie+-+1001+Rabbit+Tales%5BMux+-+XviD+-+ITA+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721b9b24a28958e5b0ece14d91174f33ac97694e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,27,155,36,162,137,88,229,176,236,225,77,145,23,79,51,172,151,105,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
