Caring for her family and preserving their everyday life is paramount.  And so, when one of her sons, Max, becomes depressed, Mary Beth becomes focused on him, and is blindsided by a shocking act of violence. What happens afterwards is a testament to the power of a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s love and determination, and to the invisible line of hope and healing that connects one human being with another. Ultimately, in the hands of Anna QuindlenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mesmerizing prose, Every Last One is a novel about facing every last one of the the things we fear most, about finding ways to navigate a road we never intended to travel, to live a life we never dreamed weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d have to live but must be brave enough to try.\n  \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f479e8c32fcd71c4635c0c17c6069a493fa2d55","amp;dn":"Every+Last+One+-+Anna+Quindlen%2CEpub%2CLit%2CPdf%2CTxt%2CMobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f479e8c32fcd71c4635c0c17c6069a493fa2d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,71,158,140,50,252,215,28,70,53,192,193,124,96,105,164,147,250,45,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
