Take a look at the features list below!\n\nNative\nHopper is perfectly adapted to the Windows environment. It fully makes use of the Cocoa framework, and perfectly integrate with other applications.\n\nFast Disassembler\nHopper has been designed to be fast and responsive. Disassembling and analyzing, even large binaries, is very fast. And the memory footprint is reduced to a very small amount!\n\nProcedures\nHopper analyzes the function prologues, and try to extract procedural informations, like basic blocks and local variables.\n\nControl Flow Graph\nOnce a procedure has been detected, Hopper is able to show you its control flow graph in a graphical way. The graph nodes are customizable, and you can even export a PDF.\n\nScriptable\nMost of the Hopper features can be invoked from Python scripts, giving you the possibility to transform the binary the way you want.\n\nObjective-C\nEven if Hopper can disassemble any kind of Intel executable, it do not forget its main platform. Hopper is specialized in retrieving Objective-C informations in the files you analyze, like selectors, strings and messages sent. \n\nDebugger\nThanks to its free companion application, Hopper is able to use GDB, which lets you debug and analyze the binary in a dynamic way.\n\nDecompiler\nAnd, if you still want more informations about the program you analyze, you can ask Hopper to generate pseudo-code from procedures, which takes advantage of the results of its analysis!\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows XP and Above All\n\nHomepage: http://www.hopperapp.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Run Keygen and patch to register application.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ebc59f5362f97b29260b3fd400e07a029f36999","amp;dn":"Hopper+Disassembler+v2.7.12+Incl+Keygen+and+PatchLz0+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ebc59f5362f97b29260b3fd400e07a029f36999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,188,89,245,54,47,151,178,146,96,179,253,64,14,7,160,41,243,105,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
