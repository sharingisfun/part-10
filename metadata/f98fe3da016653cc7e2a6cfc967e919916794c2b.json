Writing for senior IT developers, strategists, and enterprise architects, the authors cover everything from concepts to implementation, requirements to tools. \n\n The authors first review the Java EE platformÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s essential elements in the context of SOA and web services deployment, and demonstrate how Java EE has evolved into the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best open source solution for enterprise SOA. After discussing standards such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, they walk through implementing each key aspect of SOA with Java EE. Step by step, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to integrate service-oriented web and business components of Java EE technologies with the help of process-oriented standards such as BPEL/CDL into a coherent, tiered enterprise architecture that can deliver a full spectrum of business services.\n\n Implementing SOA Using JavaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ EE concludes with a section-length case study that walks through analyzing a companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s requirements, creating an effective SOA architecture, and building a concise proof-of-concept prototype with NetBeans IDE.
