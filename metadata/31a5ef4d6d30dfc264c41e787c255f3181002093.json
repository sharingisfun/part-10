The mole was the most important asset of Chinese Intelligence, and Fao Bhang, head of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ministry of State Security (MSS), responds to the discovery and brutal elimination of the mole, by immediately placing a kill order on the man responsibleÃ¢â‚¬â€Dewey Andreas. \n\nDewey is tracked to Argentina, where he is on vacation with his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Jessica Tanzer, a U.S. National Security Advisor. A top-level kill team is sent in quickly and quietly, but their attack fails to take out Dewey. The collateral damage, however, is both horrifying and deeply personal. With nothing left to lose, Andreas is determined to have his revenge. Once he learns who is probably behind the attackÃ¢â‚¬â€and why they are after himÃ¢â‚¬â€Dewey goes rogue, using all of his assets and skills to launch a counterattack. Andreas must now face the full weight and might of the MSS, Chinese Intelligence, and the formidable Fao Bhang, if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to achieve his one last goal: revenge on a biblical scale, no matter the odds or the armies that he will have to fight his way through. AndreasÃ¢â‚¬â€former Army Ranger and DeltaÃ¢â‚¬â€is a man of great skills and cunning. His opponent, Fao Bhang, is ruthless, determined, and with no limit to the assets at his disposal. \n\nIn this conflict, there are only two possible outcomes. And only one Dewey Andreas.\n\nFull retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready.
