As preceded by 2004&amp;#039;s blockbuster Night Watch and followed by Dusk Watch, this sophomore film picks up on the byzantine tale of a world where, centuries ago, the powers of light (representing goodness) and the powers of darkness (representing evil) called a truce. Each side set up a law enforcement team to guard and monitor the other&amp;#039;s activities - the powers of darkness established and controlled the Day Watch, while the powers of light established and controlled the Night Watch. Day Watch opens in the 14th Century, where Tamerlan, a Mongol warrior, acquires an implement called &quot;The Chalk of Destiny,&quot; that can be used to guide the course of history. Eons later (in the present day), the Day Watch and the Night Watch are ongoing. Two Warriors of Light, Anton Gorodensky (Konstantin Khabensky) and his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©/partner-in-training, Svetlana (Maria Poroshina) quietly develop feelings for one another as they patrol the Night Watch together. As the story progresses, the pair must respond to a distress call from an octogenarian victim of a vampiric attack - an attack committed (as it turns out) by Anton&amp;#039;s 12-year-old son Egor (Dima Martinov) - now a Warrior of Darkness.Anton must suddenly wrestle with two conflicting desires - the need to protect his offspring by destroying incriminating evidence, and his own desire to remain loyal to the Night Watch. Several additional subplots then unfold concurrently, including that of Egor learning to practice evil from his mentor, Zavulon (Viktor Verzhbitsky), that of Anton &quot;body swapping&quot; with associate Olga (Galina Tyunina), and that of the relationship between a vampiric child, Kostya (Aleksei Chadov) and his dad (Valery Zolotukhin), who works as a butcher. ~ Nathan Southern, All Movie Guide\n\nWarning: This product is intended for mature audiences only.

In 1342, the Warriors of Light (led by Gesser, Lord of Light) and the Warriors of Darkness (led by Zavulon, General of Darkness) declare a truce under which each side will form a law enforcement team to monitor the other side&amp;#039;s activities. The Warriors of Light, who enforce the powers of good, patrol the Night Watch, while the Warriors of Darkness, who openly embrace evil, staff the Day Watch. Each watch group also contains &quot;Others,&quot; mortals with supernatural powers from both sides that include vampires, shapeshifters, witches, and the like. Prophecy suggests that one day, a Great One will surface and permanently extinguish the threat of an apocalyptic war between the two sides by upsetting the balance, lending greater power to either good or evil (depending on his or her choice) and thus determining the future of mankind forever. \n\nIn 1992, Night Watch member and Warrior of Light Anton Gordesky (Konstantin Khabensky) discovers he&amp;#039;s an &quot;other&quot; amid a sting on a witch. Cut to twelve years later. In 2004, Anton still works the Night Watch, but now he&amp;#039;s a vampiric warrior who drinks blood. One night, while on patrol, he rescues a young boy named Egor (Dima Martinov) from a handful of Dark Warriors, but in the process, he encounters Svetlana (Maria Poroshina), a woman who acts as a &quot;funnel&quot; -- a conduit for the powers of evil. Anton reflects on the prophecy regarding &quot;The Great One,&quot; and begins to suspect that Svetlana and Egor may be harbingers of this fateful event. As the first installment in a Russian trilogy, Night Watch (aka Nochnoj Dozor) was a massive box-office success in its native Russia, and is followed by the second installment, Day Watch; it was released in the U.S. with a heavy prologue and epilogue, and animated subtitles that alternately scuttle across the screen, dissolve, shudder, and explode. \n\n20th Century Fox not only purchased United States distribution rights for the film, but also announced plans for a Westernized remake. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide\n\nWarning: This product is intended for mature audiences only.
