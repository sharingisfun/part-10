Exploring the latest breakthroughs in male psychology and neurology with her trademark accessibility and candor, she reveals that the male brain:\n\n     *is a lean, mean, problem-solving machine. Faced with a personal problem, a man will use his analytical brain structures, not his emotional ones, to find a solution. \n\n     *thrives under competition, instinctively plays rough and is obsessed with rank and hierarchy. \n\n     *has an area for sexual pursuit that is 2.5 times larger than the female brain, consuming him with sexual fantasies about female body parts.\n\n     *experiences such a massive increase in testosterone at puberty that he perceive others' faces to be more aggressive.\n\n\nThe Male Brain finally overturns the stereotypes. Impeccably researched and at the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, this is a book that every man, and especially every woman bedeviled by a man, will need to own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc4b03a06dd65149bf9c027cdcf8c85b1640b3b","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+The+Male+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc4b03a06dd65149bf9c027cdcf8c85b1640b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,196,176,58,6,221,101,20,155,249,192,39,205,207,140,133,177,100,11,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
