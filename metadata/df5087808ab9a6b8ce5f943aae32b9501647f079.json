The goal was to obtain a fresh installed OS with all the settings in the right place by default, rather than going manually through all the adjustments one by one. When you format and install a new OS you waste a lot of time, (setting up windows, registry setting, icons etc...)\n\n\nI used Windows 7 Professional as a base version for this release, simply because 7 Professional comes without backup and bit locker features. Dism has been used to integrate updates and removing useless packages like &quot;The upgrading version option&quot; (the annoying entry in the control panel that bothers you to update to the ultimate version), Country packages and others...\n\nVisual Customization: (default)\n\n* Special ROG theme\n* System icons\n* System sounds\n* Wallpapers\n* Media center full customization\n* Media player (background changer)\n* System Fonts (Only ROG THEME)\n\nDefault setting and registry setting:\n\n* Removed the imposed default 100 Mb Partition upon installation.
