On Their Debut As Performers, They Display An Irresistible Knack For Hooky Tracks Rooted In The Eclectic Listening Habits They Developed While Growing Up In The Multiracial Virginia Beach, Virginia, Neighborhoods They Still Call Home. Fusing Album Rock And Rap More Forcefully And Convincingly Than Kid Rock Or Durst-Style Aggro Bands (The Latter Of Whom They Seem To Lampoon On &quot;Rock Star&quot;), N.E.R.D. Whip Up A Creamy Yet Slammin' Mix.

The Live Instrumentation That Replaces The Machine-Tooled Tracks Of An Earlier Import Version Of In Search Of Retains The Tunes' Syncopation While Rendering It Palatable For Less Eclectic Rock Fans. While Not A Commercial Blockbuster On The Order Of Many Of Their Clients' Discs, This Venture Is Nonetheless One Of 2002's Standout Releases.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Lap Dance\t\t\t- Featuring Lee Harvey &amp; Vita\n[02] Things Are Getting Better\n[03] Brain\n[04] Provider\n[05] Truth Or Dare \t\t- Featuring Kelis &amp; Pusha T\n[06] Tape You\n[07] Run To The Sun\n[08] Baby Doll\n[09] Am I High\t\t\t- Featuring Malice\n[10] Rock Star\n[11] Bobby James\n[12] Stay Together\n[13] Rock Star \t\t\t- (Nevins Classic Club Blaster)\n \n\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time\t- 01h:01m:39s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 144 mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320 khps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Punk R&amp;B \n\nOriginally Release\t\t- 12 March 2002\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Virgin\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.n-e-r-d.com \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992b54f50bea6a4ce03bc691febd500d1d40a8ff","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+In+Search+Of+-+N+E+R+D+-+144mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992b54f50bea6a4ce03bc691febd500d1d40a8ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,43,84,245,11,234,106,76,224,59,198,145,254,189,80,13,29,64,168,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
