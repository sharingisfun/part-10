Particular attention is devoted to the principles of surgery, but important aspects of radiation and medical oncology are also discussed. Furthermore, diagnostic, staging, and treatment algorithms are presented that will offer invaluable assistance in management decision making. The second aim of the book is to offer a comprehensive reference source on the role of surgery in curative and palliative management for medical and radiation oncologists (in practice and in training) and other healthcare professionals involved in the care of cancer patients. The full range of cancer types is covered in a practical, multidisciplinary approach, and additional chapters are devoted to pediatric malignancies, the role of new surgical technologies, and surgical emergencies.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¹\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a33737d20ce50e9e308ed009b5b20dbf8ccb759","amp;dn":"What%27s+New+in+Surgical+Oncology+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a33737d20ce50e9e308ed009b5b20dbf8ccb759","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,51,115,125,32,206,80,233,227,8,237,0,155,91,32,219,248,204,183,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
