With only months to go before the railway was to be torn down, a passionate grassroots effort led by activists and local groups banded together to save the hulking steel structure from the wrecking ball.\r\nToday's reimagined High Line Park floats 30 feet in the air and offers visitors a carefully curated world of woodlands, thickets, prairies, and meadows, meandering through 22 blocks of Manhattan's West Side. It winds through streets and bygone eras, providing an intimate glimpse of neighborhoods and architecture, and an elevated view of New York's bustling street activity.\r\nProduced as part of the award-winning documentary series, Great Museums, &quot;Elevated Thinking&quot; was filmed over two years and captures the beauty of the High Line's spaces over the course of all four seasons. It also details the remarkable efforts of neighborhood activists, philanthropists, developers and city officials, and the architects, designers, and landscapers who created this model of urban imagination.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/98/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/98/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Elevated-Thinking-The-High-Line-in-New-York-City-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2999 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.26 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://greatmuseums.org/explore/more/elevated-thinking-the-high-line-in-new-york-city","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873b01ab4d8a64f7ab3f26df2d6f51e3717089eb","amp;dn":"Great+Museums+Elevated+Thinking+The+High+Line+in+New+York+City+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873b01ab4d8a64f7ab3f26df2d6f51e3717089eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,59,1,171,77,138,100,247,171,63,38,223,45,111,81,227,113,112,137,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
