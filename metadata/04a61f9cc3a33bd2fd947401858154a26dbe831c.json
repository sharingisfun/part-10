But it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. It was not my sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s either, nor my motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\nA literature professor at La Salle University, Andrew MeredithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father was fired after unspecified allegations of sexual misconduct. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a transgression Andrew cannot forgive, for it brought about long-lasting familial despair. In the wake of the scandal, AndrewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents limp along, trapped in an unhappy marriage. Meanwhile, Andrew treads water, stuck in a kind of suspended adolescenceÃ¢â‚¬â€falling in and out of school, moving blindly from one half-hearted relationship to the next, slowly killing the nights drinking beer and listening to music with his childhood friends.\n\nBroke, Andrew moves back home to his childhood neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia and takes a job alongside his father as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“remover,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the name for those unseen, unsung workers who take away the bodies of those who die at home. He describes, as only a professional can do, the intimate, horrific, poignant, and occasionally morbidly comedic aspects of handling the dead. Just how do you carry a 500-pound corpse down winding stairs? What actually happens to pacemakers, tooth fillings, surgical screws, artificial hips, and anything else that the deceased has within his or her body? Andrew begins to see his father not through the lens of a wronged and resentful child, but as a sympathetic, imperfect man who loves his family despite his flaws. Eventually the chip on his shoulder starts to lose its weight. \n\nPoetic without being florid, and with the literary ability to transform the naturally grotesque into the exquisite, The Removers is a searing story of a young man who finds in death a redemptive path toward the forgiveness of the living, including himself.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a61f9cc3a33bd2fd947401858154a26dbe831c","amp;dn":"The+Removers%2C+A+Memoir-+Andrew+Meredith+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a61f9cc3a33bd2fd947401858154a26dbe831c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,166,31,156,195,163,59,210,253,148,116,1,133,129,84,162,109,190,131,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
