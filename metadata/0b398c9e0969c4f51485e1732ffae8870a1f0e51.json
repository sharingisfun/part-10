Go for it! :D\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nIn contrast to previous texts focusing on either computational, structural or synthetic methods, this one-of-a-kind guide integrates all three skill sets for a complete picture of contemporary structure-based design.\nAs a result, this practical book demonstrates how to develop a high-affinity ligand with drug-like properties for any given drug target for which a high-resolution structure exists. The authors, both of whom have successfully designed drug-like molecules that were later developed into marketed drugs, use numerous examples of recently developed drugs to present best practice in structure-based drug design with the novice in mind. By way of a carefully balanced mix of theoretical background and case studies ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b398c9e0969c4f51485e1732ffae8870a1f0e51","amp;dn":"Structure-based+Design+of+Drugs+and+Other+Bioactive+Molecules+%5BP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b398c9e0969c4f51485e1732ffae8870a1f0e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,57,140,158,9,105,196,245,20,133,225,115,47,250,232,135,10,31,14,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
