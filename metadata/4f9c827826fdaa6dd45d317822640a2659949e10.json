It pulsates like a tremor, as if we're entering a universe after some unnamed, unmentioned nuclear disaster. While it's easy to make visual association to familiar images of horror like Night of the Living Dead when the film opens on a dark pasture with zombie-like peasants, SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²; or The 120 Days of Sodom while a group of Russian criminals strip a group of beautiful youths naked or Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me as characters malevolently scream into the air, Grandrieux's vision is wholly unique.\n\nMelania (Anna Mouglalis) is one of those SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² youths, stripped first of her clothes and then of her hair before entering some sort of sex trade. Seymour (Zachary Knighton) is the Yankee teenager, somehow wrapped up in this seedy world, who wants to save her, even if he can't get an erection while they're fucking and even if he isn't sure why he wants to help her.\n\n-------- not my rip -----------\n         thx to snb\n-------------------------------\n\nFile Name .............: La Vie Nouvelle.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,467,516,928 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:40:17 (150425 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 704x368 () [=] [=1.913]\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1727 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.267 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[N-VOP]...[]...[GMC]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 215 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
