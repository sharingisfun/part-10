Each book is made up of two parts: An introduction that provides an overview of the history and culture of the community in Singapore and a selection of 55Ã¢â‚¬â€œ65 recipes. This section will include traditional dishes, dishes that boast a distinct regional variation that makes them uniquely Singaporean as well dishes that have been adapted over time with lifestyle changes. A brief but informative headnote introduces each recipe and explains the history/significance of the dish and/or other interesting facts related to the dish or ingredients used.With its focus on the cultural and culinary heritage of the Chinese, Malay, Indians, Eurasians and Peranakans in Singapore, the Singapore Heritage Cookbook series will be the definitive reference for anyone looking to learn and understand more about the different ethnic groups in Singapore.\nI would like tomention that I am not too happy with the formatting of this ePUB but there is nothing I can do about it!\n\nCONTENTS\nForeword\nAcknowledgements\nIntroduction\nBasic Recipes\nVegetables &amp; Salads\nMeat &amp; Poultry\nFish &amp; SeafoodSoups\nRice &amp; Noodles\nSnacks &amp; Desserts\nGlossary of Ingredients\nMenu Suggestions\nWeights &amp; Measures\nResources\nIndex\nPhoto Credits\nAbout the Author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba9f1144ffb12b8c695e8ff72871d3eb26e266b","amp;dn":"Peranakan+Heritage+Cooking+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba9f1144ffb12b8c695e8ff72871d3eb26e266b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,169,241,20,79,251,18,184,198,149,232,255,114,135,29,62,178,110,38,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
