If the artists' ages are the most immediately noteworthy aspect of this release, their considerable vocal abilities are a strong, striking second: whether singly or (more typically) in sisterly harmony, the SÃƒÂ¶derbergs sing in full, earthy, expressive tones that belie their years. The same can't quite be said for their songwriting: if the cutesy &quot;lets pretend&quot; intro to the lullaby-like &quot;Little Moon&quot; opens the album by overtly tipping their hand to youth, the several songs about frustrated domestic relationships (a curious preoccupation -- perhaps it seemed like an appropriate topic for the genre?) are even more of a giveaway, tellingly informed by imagination and hearsay rather than than lived experience (sometimes, as on the confusedly personal-cum-political &quot;Our Own Pretty Ways,&quot; it's just hard to tell what they're trying to get at.) Still, if the second-person failed-marriage saga &quot;You're Not Coming Home Tonight&quot; feels more like a transposed runaway-child fantasy than a defiant feminist statement, that doesn't make its strummy amble and deliciously catchy chorus harmonies any less infectious. First Aid Kit are -- as well they should be at this stage of the game -- still in the process of refining their craft, and still taking plenty of cues from other artists (the gorgeous cover of Fleet Foxes' &quot;Tiger Mountain Peasant Song&quot; appended to later versions of this release makes their connections to the contemporary American indie folk revival all the more explicit), but the raw materials they've got at their disposal -- beyond-solid vocal chops and a sure way with a melodic hook -- all signal great things to come. Without straying too far from comfortably rootsy folk territory, Drunken Trees also offers a fair amount of range -- not nearly as straightforwardly sugar-sweet as they may at first seem, the duo can pull off poppy, dead sober, retro-rock (&quot;Cross Oceans,&quot; which piles on the handclaps, electric organ, and rollicking drumbeat) and spooky (check the spare, ghostly &quot;Jagadamba&quot; -- they're not signed to the Knife's Rabid label for nothing) with equal conviction -- which makes it all the more intriguing to see where they'll go from here.\n [/color][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:124f84b944d78dacc8ba9c17b28e68fbdd33f97c","amp;dn":"First+Aid+Kit+-+Drunken+Trees+%5B2008%5D+%5BEP%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"124f84b944d78dacc8ba9c17b28e68fbdd33f97c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,79,132,185,68,215,141,172,200,186,156,23,178,142,104,251,221,51,249,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
