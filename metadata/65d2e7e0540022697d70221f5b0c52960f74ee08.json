The format was a deliberate departure \nfrom the Monty Python's Flying Circus stream-of-\nconsciousness meta-comedy, returning to a more conventional \nsketch show format. Sketches were mostly self-contained, \nlasting from a few seconds to a few minutes and often had a \ndegree of naturalism in performance. The series launched the \ncareers of several high-profile actors and writers, and also \nled to other comedy series including Blackadder, Mr. Bean, \nand Alas Smith and Jones.\n\nNOTE: The DVD contained 8 complete episodes rather than\na collection of individual sketches. I suppose it must\nmean they are the best episodes of the series... according\nto somebody anyway.\n\nIMDb Link.......: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080253/\nIMDb Ratings....: 8.1/10 from 1,211 users\nStars...........: Rowan Atkinson, Pamela Stephenson,\n                  Mel Smith, Griff Rhys Jones\nGenre...........: Comedy\n\nFILE INFO:\n\nContainers......: mkv\nFile Size.......: 1154 MB (144 MB per episode)\nRun Time........: 3:17:10 (25 min per episode)\nChapters........: Yes\nVideo...........: resolution 696x538, 4:3, x264\nVideo Quality...: Constant RF: 24,0\nAudio...........: aac, 96 kbps, 1.0 channel\nAudio Language..: English\nSoft-Coded Subs.: Swedish, Finnish (VobSub, muxed in)\nFrame Rate......: 25,00 fps\nSource..........: DVD (PAL)\nSample..........: Included\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/i19sk76yh/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/i19sk76yh/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/s19adu7ll/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/s19adu7ll/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/f5wpdc2yh/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/f5wpdc2yh/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_3.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/5nwydaha1/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/5nwydaha1/NTNOCN_BO_Screenshot_4.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d2e7e0540022697d70221f5b0c52960f74ee08","amp;dn":"Not+The+Nine+O%27Clock+News+-+Best+Of+DVDRip+x264+aac+mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d2e7e0540022697d70221f5b0c52960f74ee08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,210,231,224,84,0,34,105,125,112,34,31,91,12,82,150,15,116,238,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
