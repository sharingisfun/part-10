Troubled by insomnia, Young began spending his evenings in the household basement, where a computer and several instruments provided a welcome diversion from his sleeping patterns. He eventually combined those diversions into a blend of electronica and emo-pop, using little more than his computer and various keyboards to record the material. Songs were uploaded to /MySpace upon completion, and Young began attracting a surprising amount of attention on the networking site. Of particular note was &quot;Hello Seattle,&quot; a fabricated ode to the Emerald City whose viral popularity earned Young a record contract with Universal Republic. Ocean Eyes, his debut release for the label, arrived in 2009, coinciding with Owl City's first national tour.\n\n\nDisc 01\n01. &quot;Cave In&quot;\n02. &quot;The Bird and The Worm&quot;\n03. &quot;Hello Seattle&quot;\n04. &quot;Umbrella Beach&quot;\n05. &quot;The Saltwater Room&quot;\n06. &quot;Dental Care&quot;\n07. &quot;Meteor Shower&quot;\n08. &quot;On The Wing&quot;\n09.  &quot;Fireflies&quot;\n10. &quot;The Tip Of The Iceberg&quot;\n11. &quot;Vanilla Twilight&quot;\n12. &quot;Tidal Wave&quot;\n\nDisc 02\n01. &quot;Hot Air Balloon&quot;\n02. &quot;Butterfly Wings&quot;\n03. &quot;Rugs From Me To You&quot;\n04. &quot;Sunburn&quot;\n05. &quot;Hello Seattle&quot;\n06. &quot;If My Heart Was a House&quot;\n07. &quot;Strawberry Avalanche&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c49e1fff1821de5a2e0597b622f29c26ac97413","amp;dn":"Owl+City+-+Ocean+Eyes+-+Deluxe+Edition+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c49e1fff1821de5a2e0597b622f29c26ac97413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,73,225,255,241,130,29,229,162,224,89,123,98,47,41,194,106,201,116,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
