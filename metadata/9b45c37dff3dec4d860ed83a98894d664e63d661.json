It was during this time that they developed what would become their signature &quot;glam&quot; sound. The music was an aggressive mixture of punk and glam rock, which spoke of rebellion, failed relationships, and the underground culture that they epitomized. Songs such as &quot;Cinderella in Black&quot;, &quot;Hush Child&quot;, &quot;Dark Angels&quot; and &quot;Teenage Lipstick Boys&quot; were power chord driven and defiant, yet also hook- centered and melodic.\r\n\r\nThe band then relocated to Los Angeles where they became fixtures into the 90s. Bobby St. Valentine changed his name to Bobby Durango, and actor Johnny Depp, also from South Florida, joined the band and played guitar with them before getting a part on 21 Jump Street., \r\n\r\nGeffen Records took notice and bought their contract from New Renaissance Records in 1986. Geffen offered Rock City Angels a contract. Eventually Young Man's Blues, produced by Joe Hardy, was released in 1988. The band toured in support of the album with such acts as Joan Jett and Georgia Satellites.\r\n\r\nYear:\t1988\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t134.01 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t05/03/2016 \r\nFiles:\t16\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength : 00:51:50\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\n01.
