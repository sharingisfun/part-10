Penning new rock anthems with Erik MÃƒÂ¥rtensson (ECLIPSE/W.E.T) in Stockholm since October 2013, originally dedicated for the long awaited sixth studio album from Wigwam. When Wigwam surprisingly decided to call it a day after 13 years, Age Sten soon formed his own band, recording the new songs in the vein of the new band effort AMMUNITION.\nimage\nThe new material wears the same catchiness as Wigwam, yet offers a rougher and more subtle sound and arrangements than his former bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latter productions. Produced by one of melodic rocks most esteemed producers Erik MÃƒÂ¥rtensson, Ammuniton is now on the verge of finishing its first album due for a release later this year.\nWith a dream team of rock musicians in the line-up Ammunition has already debuted live, blasting through Wigwam gems blended with new unreleased songs from the forthcoming album and live favorites from LED ZEPPELIN and QUEEN.\n\nimage\nAge Sten Nilsen's Ammunition Official Site\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Shanghaied\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.

Access Denied (Japanease Bonus Track)\n\nLabel: Avalon\n\n\nI must say that, when Wig Wam announced that they were calling it a day, I was almost inconsolableÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I may have seen by this point more than 1000 shows but I still consider their show in a small haunt in Athens, in front of no more than 200 hooligans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of the top 3 shows IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen in my life, rivaling the likes of AC/DCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of this world and the likeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ so that should give you a brisk idea of just HOW GOOD, that show must have been! I must however in all honesty admit, that their Ã¢â‚¬Å“finalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (?!) album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wall StreetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounded a little tired and forced and not as much fun as the previous ones, so maybe the band, saw that they had taken it far enough and decided to quit, while they were ahead, before they made a real mockery of themselves.\n\nAt any rate, their restless frontman, Ãƒâ€¦ge Sten Nilsen, who seemingly, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand still, just, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t and he took, the songs he had written for a new Wig Wam album to the hot new producer for all things Scandi-melodic-rock and member of Eclipse and WET, Erik Martensson, with a view to complete an album. Slowly more songs were added and more musicians, like Hal Patino the former King Diamond and Pretty Maids bassist, who also is joining Age in the cover band Nordic Beast, were brought in. similarly, another one of AgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends Jon Pettersen, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been playing guitar on his Queen tribute performances and whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a member of Bad Habits also joined, on guitars, besides Erik, forming a twin guitar attack. SabatonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Robban Back, who also plays in Eclipse was summoned to provide the Ã¢â‚¬Å“batteryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Circus Maximus and sometimes Wig Wam keyboard player, Lasse Finbrathen just completed the puzzle. More or less, a bit of Scandi, super-duper line-up of musicians with a mind to play some greatly honed melodic rock that would probably just push the pedal to the metal a bit more than Wig Wam ever didÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to likeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ then?\n\nÃƒâ€¦ge and Erik seem to have managed to create a great hybrid between their main Ã¢â‚¬Å“bandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ without, sounding like copyistsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Ãƒâ€¦ge brings in distinct, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SweetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“80s QueenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ influences and a sense of pomp and excess, with a tendency to go over the top vocally every once in a whileÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ while I suppose Erik manages to keep the whole thing in check and rocking, dressing it up with delicious riffs, that sound urgent, modern and in the case of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒâ€¦geÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ quite original, as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty much both a liberty to work up his ideas, but he also has the template of the vocalists Ã¢â‚¬Å“melodiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ within which he can Ã¢â‚¬Å“createÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, thus he needs to be rather inventiveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the great thing is that while thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this great rock tone in the guitar sound, very much like the early 80s bands we all loved, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much thicker, (production wise) and the whole atmosphere is consistently euphoricÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as if someone has taken the best most up-tempo moments of Def Leppard and Europe and maxxed them out and then overproduced the hell out of them and placed a great singer on top of them. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possibly my best description for this project and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not even a good one! And you know what? Most of the songs are great too!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“SilverbackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ begins with its massive chorus and why wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it?! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catchy as hell! Then it proceeds to groove like a mofo with a thumbing, driving pattern hitting hard and repeating an almost monolithic, bridge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ before the chorus drops again after an awesome but albeit short lead! Hard rock Heaven! Excuse me as I collect my jaw from the floor!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Give Me a SignÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“pussywippedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ballad, but it ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite like that... itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually a nasty, riff driven mid-tempo track with a strong chorus, that holds out, remarkably well, but seem to be borrowing a little bit too much from a Wig-oldieÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ShanghaiedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is weird as hellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ anyone that might have heard Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒâ€¦geÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ solo albums, might be aware of his Ã¢â‚¬Å“storytellingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ abilities, but this Ã¢â‚¬Å“cautionary taleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is done in a grand musical style, is nothing more than a hilarious joke about a Ã¢â‚¬Å“lady-boyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?! Dafuck man?!! This will make Beijing duck, uneasy to go down, for a whileÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ lol!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Tie Me DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another Ã¢â‚¬Å“singleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song with an irresistible chorus and an ascending riff, that just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quitÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple but effective rock Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn roll, with an infectious groove and a nice sing-alongÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ well these boys, have gotten Ã¢â‚¬Å“the ideaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½... apparently this version is different to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“single or video editÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ since it has a spoken-outro and is noted as such. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an Ã¢â‚¬Å“outro versionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ specific to the album I suppose.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Road to BabylonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a great ballad, that begins quite typically but soon gets more and more lush in terms of orchestration, with backing vocals and layers of guitars making it more and more spiritual almost to a point where it sounds like a chantÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the solo as well, is just a Ã¢â‚¬Å“jewelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ if I say this song is a masterpiece, then I hope I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t used the word in vainÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBecause the Good Lord might Ã¢â‚¬Å“Take Out the Enemy (Hallelujah)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦(?!) This song had me going a little (WTF) since it begins, with a proper gospel belting, then it goes to hell and it comes back to the straight and narrow again and it just plays ping pong between heaven and hell, very melodically too! What were these guys smoking really?!?!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Hit Me with Your BombsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is cute and rhythmical as they come, but it just seems to lack the luster, of a bona fide single track. The chorus is good, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not great... thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something amiss in this song that keeps it from just delivering its full payload, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d excuse my punÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Do You Like ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was probably the first track that was completed and sampled from the album. While itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit too Ã¢â‚¬Å“glamtasticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bearing all those Kiss-disco elements from around the Ã¢â‚¬Å“DynastyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ era itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all that bad, with it thumping, thudding progression, even if in a couple of places it might feel too flashy, even for its own good. Heck, I like pop metal, or even straight up pop, but yeah, I was kind of cringingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but on the other hand, well, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the problem with being a bit more lighthearted?!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WildcardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a semi-acoustic ballad, that gets electric midway, with sing-alongs, along the way, in a way not to dissimilar to the Bon JoviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of this world, but a lot brighter, even if the theme, is a little more trickyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Another Piece of MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a punchy acoustic song that turns into a rocker at times and is quite interesting, because it explores great dynamics and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite unusual... structurally. Obviously, fans of ASN, might have heard something similar on his previous solo album, but the general public might be taken by surpriseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HeartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not in ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a real tear-jerker, a very sentimental track that just goes on and on, with Age pouring out his soul in an amazing performance that epitomizes why he is such a great singer/artistÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Strung OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a mid-tempo track drowned in 80s sounding keyboards and crunchy guitars, that has this British sound, that's not too bad, but is not really, scoring too high either.\n\nLast but not least Ã¢â‚¬Å“Access DeniedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the Japanese bonus track and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty good, melodic and uplifting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it would have been much better replacing a number of the tracks that are tacked towards the end of the record, that could have taken its place instead.\n\nOverall, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShanghaiedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an impressive comeback from Ãƒâ€¦ge Sten Nilsen, under the pretext of a full band, following the dissolution of Wig Wam and his recent solo endeavors. The brand of Ã¢â‚¬Å“funÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and frolicky rock Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn roll, that Wig Wam were known for will seemingly not die, with them and we can always hope that in later years, they can always do the Ã¢â‚¬Å“We did it for not too much money Ã¢â‚¬â€œ reunion tourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Europe and Japan! Until then a good number of Ã¢â‚¬Å“SanghaiedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ numbers could and should receive regular rotation in your playlists if good time rock Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn roll/metal is your poison!\n\nimage\n\nGenre: Rock\nSubgenre: Hard Rock\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 108.78 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n13 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19214c6a3525d69439672ff02246587648886230","amp;dn":"+Age+Sten+Nilsens+Ammunition+-+Shanghaied%28Japanese+Edition%29+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19214c6a3525d69439672ff02246587648886230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,33,76,106,53,37,214,148,57,103,47,240,34,70,88,118,72,136,98,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
