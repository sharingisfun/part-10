With wit and irreverence, in question-and-answer form, Don't Know Much AboutÃ‚Â® History took readers on a rollicking ride through more than five hundred years of American history, from Columbus's voyages to recent events. The book became an instant classic and has sold more than 1.6 million copies.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/59a8/a37fcf68.png[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c12494114b676efffb59a8b2e7d2d3c033975e","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Know+Much+About+History%2C+Anniversary+Edition+-+Everything+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c12494114b676efffb59a8b2e7d2d3c033975e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,193,36,148,17,75,103,110,255,251,89,168,178,231,210,211,192,51,151,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
