It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.[/b]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nm6EriX.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5705d73fc4fd3b9e2b28deb17e78ff58f4bbd029","amp;dn":"Doctor_Who_2005.8x12.Death_In_Heaven.HDTV_x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5705d73fc4fd3b9e2b28deb17e78ff58f4bbd029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,5,215,63,196,253,59,158,43,40,222,177,126,120,255,88,244,187,208,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
