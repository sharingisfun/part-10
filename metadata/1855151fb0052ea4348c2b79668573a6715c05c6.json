From the invention of scripts and alphabets to the long misunderstood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtalking drumsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Africa, James Gleick tells the story of information technologies that changed the very nature of human consciousness. He provides portraits of the key figures contributing to the inexorable development of our modern understanding of information: Charles Babbage, the idiosyncratic inventor of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Byron, the poetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brilliant and doomed daughter, who became the first true programmer; pivotal figures like Samuel Morse and Alan Turing; and Claude Shannon, the creator of information theory itself.\nAnd then the information age comes upon us. Citizens of this world become experts willy-nilly: aficionados of bits and bytes. And they sometimes feel they are drowning, swept by a deluge of signs and signals, news and images, blogs and tweets. The Information is the story of how we got here and where we are heading. It will transform readersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ view of its subject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1855151fb0052ea4348c2b79668573a6715c05c6","amp;dn":"The+Information%3A+A+History%2C+a+Theory%2C+a+Flood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1855151fb0052ea4348c2b79668573a6715c05c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,85,21,31,176,5,46,164,52,140,43,121,102,133,115,166,113,92,5,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
