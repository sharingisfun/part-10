It was released by Capitol Records in the United States on 21 October 1977 (catalogue number SKBL-11711) and on Parlophone in the United Kingdom on 19 November 1977 (PCSP 721). The compilation peaked at #24 in Billboard's Top LPs &amp; Tape chart during a thirty-one week stay that began on 12 November 1977. The RIAA certified the album with sales of three million units in 2000 even though the compilation was deleted in the late 1980s. The New Zealand release followed the US release with cat. no. and pressing plates, and was released on 2 different EMI labels.\n\nThe LP's original packaging included an 11 x 11&quot; booklet, with the songs' lyrics printed, calligraphy-style, on simulated parchment paper. For the first several pressings, the cover itself was simulated leather, and the Beatles' image (a re-working of Richard Avedon's 1967 portrait, featured in Look Magazine) was simulated gold-foil. The LP was also available on yellow vinyl.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Yesterday&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:03\n    &quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:47\n    &quot;I Need You&quot; (George Harrison) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\n    &quot;Girl&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n    &quot;In My Life&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:24\n    &quot;Words of Love&quot; (Buddy Holly) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:12\n    &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:22\n    &quot;Something&quot; (George Harrison) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n    &quot;And I Love Her&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:28\n    &quot;If I Fell&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:18\n    &quot;I'll Be Back&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:21\n    &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:35\n    &quot;Yes It Is&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:38\n    &quot;Michelle&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:40\n    &quot;It's Only Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:55\n    &quot;You're Going to Lose That Girl&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:16\n    &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:01\n    &quot;For No One&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:59\n    &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:35\n    &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;This Boy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:12\n    &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:02\n    &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:07\n    &quot;I Will&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:46\n    &quot;P.S.
