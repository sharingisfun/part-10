Bassist Bill Leen and guitarist Doug Hopkins formed the band in 1987 in Tempe, AZ, rounding out the initial lineup with vocalist Jesse Valenzuela, guitarist Richard Taylor, and drummer Chris McCann. The following year saw several personnel shifts as the band struggled to solidify -- McCann was replaced by Dan Henzerling (and, shortly thereafter, Phillip Rhodes), while Taylor was fired and replaced by guitarist Robin Wilson. Wilson and Valenzuela subsequently switched roles, and the band recorded a self-released album, Dusted, in 1989. A&amp;M signed them the following year. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tA&amp;M Records\nCatalog:\t\tAA B000086902\nIncludes:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Til' I Hear It From You\n02.Hey Jealousy\n03.Allison Road\n04.Until I Fall Away\n05.Found Out About You\n06.Mrs. Rita\n07.Just South Of Nowhere\n08.Lost Horizons\n09.Follow You Down\n10.As Long As It Matters\n11.Idiot Summer\n12.Pieces Of The Night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a84f63cbf6a92e75a2100ba7f76a800b04b585c","amp;dn":"20th+Century+Masters-Best+Of+Gin+Blossoms+%282003%29+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a84f63cbf6a92e75a2100ba7f76a800b04b585c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,132,246,60,191,106,146,231,90,33,0,186,127,118,168,0,176,75,88,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
