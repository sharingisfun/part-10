It ceased publication in 1990. I have 19 of its old issues which I have scanned and I share here. All are in PDF format with OCR. All ads are removed. I have included 2 short reviews also. Do write in your comments. All its issues are also available in a 3 DVD set.\n\n&quot;Born from the rubble of the defunct PlayerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chess News, Inside Chess grew to prominence in a world quite different from the one we now inhabit.  Remember that there was no Internet in 1988.  There was no Mark Crowther Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who really should set up a subscription service to let his fans support his work! Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to bring us new games on a daily and weekly basis at The Week in Chess.  Chessbase was a mere toy.  In such days there was still room for a bi-weekly magazine that would cover recent events from a near-insider perspective.  A lag of a couple of weeks between game played and annotations published was not cause for alarm; if SeirawanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wonderful annotations are any indication, it might have been preferable.\n\nThe magazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main publishers were Yasser Seirawan and John Donaldson.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to think of two people better suited for such a task.  Seirawan, of course, was a World Junior Champion, a World Championship candidate, and a second for Kortchnoi and Timman in World Championship matches.  He was also deeply involved in chess politics, having run for USCF President, worked on the GMA, and authored the Ã¢â‚¬ËœPrague AgreementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that sought to heal the dual world champions schism of the early 00s.  Donaldson, while Ã¢â‚¬ËœonlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (ha!) an IM, has served as Captain of the US Olympic team and is a eminent author, historian and theoretician.  He is currently the director of the Mechanics Institute Chess Club.\nFor large chunks of its history, Chess Life and Review was provincial, very slow to report on international events, and aimed at a very low readership in terms of skill. There was no internet though, and it had something pretty close to a monopoly in the United States, so strong club players (and up) were stuck. We could get the Informant twice a year (pretty late), and some lucky few of us could occasionally get photocopies of tournament bulletins Walter Browne would bring from overseas.\n\nIt was this vacuum that Yasser Seirawan's Inside Chess filled in a wonderful way from 1988 to 2000. For most of its run, the magazine came out every two weeks, and it included tournament reports from all over the world, with a special focus on super-tournaments. Sometimes Seirawan himself was a participant in those tournaments, but whether he was or not the reports were timely, colorful, and full of games commented on by the man himself. As an elite grandmaster, he certainly knew what he was talking about, and what was even better was his commentary style.\nIn the end, of course, Inside Chess could not compete as a bi-weekly.  They tried to continue as a bigger monthly, but as Seirawan wrote in IC 12:6, Ã¢â‚¬Å“[the Internet] fills our original niche better than Inside Chess or any magazine possibly could. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ The Internet is a powerful competitor, delivering chess news quickly and in massive amounts.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Inside Chess tried to continue as an online-only ezine, but without any advertising income or subscriber base, it could not but fail.&quot;\n\nInside Chess - Vol.2,No.25-26 (25-Dec-1989) 5,062 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.3,No.1 (22-Jan-1990) 3,626 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.3,No.2 (5-Feb-1990)        3,709 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.3,No.3 (19-Feb-1990) 3,324 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.3,No.4 (5-March-1990) 3,220 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.3,No.5 (19-March-1990) 2,622 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.3,No.6 (2-April-1990) 3,425 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.7 (13-April-1992) 3,035 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.ll (8-June-1992) 2,601 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.13 (6-July-1992) 3,098 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.14 (20-July-1992) 4,458 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.15 (3-Aug-1992) 3,043 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.16 (17-Aug-1992) 2,788 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.17 (31-Aig-1992) 2,501 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.18 (14-Septt-1992) 2,651 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.5,No.20 (12-Oct-1992) 2,315 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.6,No.3 (22-Feb-1993) 2,709 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.6,No.4 (8-March-1993) 2,423 KB\nInside Chess - Vol.6,No.7 (19-April-1993) 2,353 KB\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot; http://s9.postimg.org/rkpob762n/Inside_Chess.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://s9.postimg.org/rkpob762n/Inside_Chess.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67321cc19f84c1071e040b35c32f82bf9429a96a","amp;dn":"Inside+Chess+Magazine+-+19+Issues+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67321cc19f84c1071e040b35c32f82bf9429a96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,50,28,193,159,132,193,7,30,4,11,53,195,47,130,191,148,41,169,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
