He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and most skilled emcees of all time.[1][2][3][4] Eric B. &amp; Rakim's classic album Paid in Full was named the greatest hip hop album of all time by MTV,[5] while Rakim himself was ranked #4 on MTV's list of the Greatest MCs of All Time.[6] Steve Huey of Allmusic stated that &quot;Rakim is near-universally acknowledged as one of the greatest MCs -- perhaps the greatest -- of all time within the hip-hop community.&quot;[7] The editors of About.com ranked him #1 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2007).[8]\n\nIn addition to his career as a rap artist, he is an author and a poet. Rakim's rapping, which pioneered the use of internal rhymes in hip hop, set a higher standard of lyricism in the genre and served as a template for future rappers. Rakim began his career as a emcee for part of one of the most important rap duos of the golden age hip hop era: Eric B. &amp; Rakim. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 18th Letter - The Book of Life (Deluxe Version) 1997\n\n\nThe 18th Letter is the debut solo album of American rapper Rakim, released November 4, 1997 on Universal Records in the United States. It is his first release of new material, following a five-year hiatus after Don't Sweat the Technique (1992) as duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim.[11][12] The album features production by DJ Clark Kent, Pete Rock, Nick Wiz, and DJ Premier.[13] It contains lyrical themes that concern the hip hop's golden age, Rakim's rapping prowess, and the state of hip hop.[14]\n\nThe album debuted at number 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and sold 500,000 copies in the United States.[15][16] A deluxe version of The 18th Letter was sold with the compilation disc The Book of Life (UD2-53111),[17] an Eric B. &amp; Rakim greatest hits collection.[18] The Book of Life was also issued separately as a double vinyl LP in 1997\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 - The 18th Letter\n\n1.\t&quot;Intro&quot;\n2.\t&quot;The 18th Letter (Always And Forever)&quot; \no\tProduced by Father Shaheed\no\tContains samples from &quot;Do Your Thing&quot; by Lyn Collins\n3.\t&quot;Skit&quot;\n4.\t&quot;It's Been a Long Time&quot; \no\tProduced by DJ Premier\no\tContains samples from &quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot; by Eric B. &amp; Rakim and &quot;Call Me (Come Back Home)&quot; by Cecil Holmes\n5.\t&quot;Remember That&quot; \no\tProduced by DJ Clark Kent\no\tContains samples from &quot;Thoughts of Old Flames&quot; by Pleasure\n6.\t&quot;The Saga Begins&quot; \no\tProduced by Pete Rock\no\tContains samples from &quot;Love Has a Way&quot; by Monty Alexander and &quot;Hell on Earth (Front Lines)&quot; by Mobb Deep\n7.\t&quot;Skit&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Guess Who's Back&quot; \no\tProduced by DJ Clark Kent\no\tContains samples from &quot;Shamboozie&quot; by Bob James, &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; by Public Enemy and &quot;My Melody&quot; by Eric B. &amp; Rakim\n9.\t&quot;Stay a While&quot; \no\tProduced by DJ Clark Kent\n10.\t&quot;New York (Ya Out There)&quot; \no\tProduced by DJ Premier\no\tContains samples from &quot;Down and Out in New York City&quot; by James Brown, &quot;Long Red&quot; by Mountain and &quot;MC Battle&quot; by DJ Grand Wizard Theodore\n11.\t&quot;Show Me Love&quot; \no\tProduced by Nic Wiz\n12.\t&quot;Skit&quot;\n13.\t&quot;The Mystery (Who Is God?)&quot; \no\tProduced by Naughty Shorts; Co-Produced by Bill Blass\no\tScratches by DJ Sond\n14.\t&quot;When I'm Flowin'&quot; \no\tProduced by Pete Rock\no\tContains samples from &quot;A Time for Love&quot; by Monty Alexander and &quot;The Distant Galaxy&quot; by Don Sebesky\n15.\t&quot;It's Been a Long Time&quot; (Suave House Mix) \no\tProduced by Mo-Suave-A\n16.\t&quot;Guess Who's Back&quot; (Alternative Mix) \no\tProduced by DJ Clark Kent\n17.\t&quot;Outro&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 - The Book of Life (Eric B &amp; Rakim Greatest Hits)\n\n\n1.\t&quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Follow the Leader&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Eric B.
