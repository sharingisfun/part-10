If the project is completed,\r\n&gt; your career as a master burglar will be untenable_\r\n&gt; Steal it, before that can happen_\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nThe Swindle is a steampunk cybercrime caper about breaking into buildings, hacking their systems, stealing all their cash, and quickly running away again before the police show up.\r\nAll the buildings youâ€™ll be robbing are randomly-generated, so youâ€™ll never get the same level twice.\r\nMeanwhile, from the safety of your rickety airship up in Outer Space, you can modify your thief with new skills, tools, and all manner of advanced technological horrors, allowing you to take on bigger buildings with better security, for gargantuan rewards! Have you got what it takes to pull off The Swindle?\r\nProcedurally generated burglary simulator! No two maps are the same!\r\nPlay it your way: specialise in hacking or bombs, both are equally-valid ways through a locked door!\r\nUnique time-limited roguelike/ RPG gameplay.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: OS: Windows 7 /8/10 \r\nProcessor: 2.4Ghz \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: GeForce 8800 equivalent or higher \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nHard Drive: 1 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:648d0bfb9e34ba9fccee4f7678ba87f5e9ac1122","amp;dn":"The+Swindle+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"648d0bfb9e34ba9fccee4f7678ba87f5e9ac1122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,141,11,251,158,52,186,159,204,238,79,118,120,186,135,245,233,172,17,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
