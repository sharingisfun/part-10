Loving again, trusting again, well, that's just not in the cards. Especially now that her ex is back in town with his new woman, demanding custody of McKenna's favorite creature in the whole world--her dog. No effing way. McKenna's had enough of him, and she decides to even the score by finding her own hot young thing -- a Trophy Husband. Sure, she's only twenty-seven, but doesn't that make it even more fun -- and infuriating to her ex -- to pursue a younger man? When she declares her intentions on her daily blog, her quest quickly skyrockets in popularity, and that's when Chris enters the picture, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got all the assets. He's handsome, successful, and turns her inside out with a kiss to end all kisses, the kind that makes you feel like a shooting star. But loving again could mean losing again, and it's so much easier to focus on getting even, isn't it? Unless, you just can't help falling in love. Which means McKenna will have to come face to face with what she really wants in life -- protecting her heart from hurt, or letting go of her fears of a new beginning.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588e121e8bb00e4f64ad3c62963acb6df08f93a9","amp;dn":"Trophy+Husband+by+Lauren+Blakely+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588e121e8bb00e4f64ad3c62963acb6df08f93a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,142,18,30,139,176,14,79,100,173,60,98,150,58,203,109,240,143,147,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
