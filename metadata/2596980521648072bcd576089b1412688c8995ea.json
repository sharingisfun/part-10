In each of his musical endeavors, he incorporated his exuberant personality into his act.\nIn 1967 Prima's distinctive voice and jazzy delivery landed him a role in Walt Disney's animated feature The Jungle Book, as the raucous orangutan King Louie. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Prima&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Prima&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLouis Prima - Capitol Collectors Series\n1992\n\n01  Louis Prima - Capitol Collectors Series - Just A Gigolo / I Ain't Got Nobody\n02  Louis Prima - Capitol Collectors Series - Oh Marie\n03  Louis Prima - Capitol Collectors Series - Buona Sera\n04  Louis Prima - Capitol Collectors Series - Jump, Jive, An' Wail\n05  Louis Prima - Capitol Collectors Series - Basin Street Blues / When It's Sleepy Time Down South (Medley)\n06  Louis Prima - Capitol Collectors Series - The Lip [Feat.
