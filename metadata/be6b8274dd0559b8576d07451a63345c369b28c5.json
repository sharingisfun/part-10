And it was...glorious. This one shot special tells the tale of when Archie met the Punisher (or the other way around, depending on which cover you own). It started as a joke but actually developed into a real crossover that's well-written, funny and with excellent art as well. Jointly published by both Marvel and Archie Comics in 1994. All credit to the original scanners as always. I would have had a picture of the Archie cover as well but bayimg is down right now for some reason. Ah well, seriously enjoy this one...and please seed, thanks! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6b8274dd0559b8576d07451a63345c369b28c5","amp;dn":"The+Punisher+Meets+Archie+%281994%2C+One-Shot%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6b8274dd0559b8576d07451a63345c369b28c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,107,130,116,221,5,89,184,87,109,7,69,26,99,52,92,54,155,40,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
