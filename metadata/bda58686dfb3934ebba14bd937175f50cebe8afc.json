Starling, a pure ActionScript 3.0 library for advanced graphics, extends Flash Player 11Ã¢â‚¬Â²s support for the modern GPU (graphic processing unit) to enable visual presentations and games in the browser or as a mobile app.\n\nStarting with installation and configuration of Starling and creation of a Flash Builder project, the course shows how to prepare and import graphical assets, create MovieClip classes from sprite sheets, manage various gaming objects, detect collisions, and add both particle and sound effects. The finished game can be deployed to any browser or mobile device that integrates Flash Player 11, which was released in September 2011.\n\nTopics include:\n===============\n\n[*]Downloading and installing Starling and Flash Builder\n[*]Creating the project\n[*]Creating the main game class, static assets class, and other classes\n[*]Building the state machine\n[*]Creating a static assets class\n[*]Adding images\n[*]Creating sprite sheets with Texture Packer\n[*]Creating and importing bitmap fonts\n[*]Detecting collisions\n[*]Adding particle effects\n[*]Adding sound effects\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n[*]Welcome\n[*]Using the exercise files\n[*]What you should know\n\n\n1.
