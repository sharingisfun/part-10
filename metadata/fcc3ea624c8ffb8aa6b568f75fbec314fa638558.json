As clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© as it sounds, Joss Stone literally could sing\nthe phone book and turn the tracks into a multi-platinum record. The young and extremely\ntalented British singer-songwriter has accomplished a lot in her young career; winning the\nBBC television show Star For A Night, at the age of 14, two Brit awards and one Grammy\naward, and selling over ten million albums worldwide.\n\nJoss StoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest effort, &quot;Colour Me Free,&quot; according to Stone, was a spur of the moment\nthing: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI kind of woke up one morning and wanted to make an album&quot;, she says. &quot;It's very,\nvery raw. It's a bunch of musicians, writers and myself, and we're just jamming, basically.&quot;\n\nThe resulting product is a soul-tinged powerful set of tracks that display Joss StoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nvirtuosity as a singer and her skill at song-writing. The opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“FreeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ displays Joss\nStoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assertive and daring attitude, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell me that I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, I willÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell me cause I\nknow whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s real, what I can do.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GovernmentalistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a moody 70s R&amp;B-like track\nthat rails on her disdain for the lack of progress and action by British Government, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow\ncome we ain't getting any closer, trying to find the truth behind the lies?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GovernmentalistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nalso features a lyrically moving guest performance by rap virtuoso Nas. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Could Have Been\nYou,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“4 and 20,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Girlfriend On DemandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ address relationship woes and downfalls with\nJoss StoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark vocal confidence and lyrical certainty.\n\nOverall, &quot;Colour Me Free&quot; is a great album. All of the tracks feature intelligent lyric writing\nand of course StoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strong soulful voice. The woman hits every\nnote just right. However, the track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“You Got The Love,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ a gospel song about faith and\nconfidence in God seems to be a little out of place on an album filled mostly with either angst\nridden love songs or other more emotionally charged songs that are trying to make a point.\n\nJoss StoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faithful fans will definitely be pleased with the singer-songwriterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest effort.\nSoul, Blues, and R&amp;B fans who havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t given Stone much beyond a casual listen should\nreinvest their ears to Joss Stone and &quot;Colour Me Free.&quot; She is going places.[/b][/color]\n\n\n\n   [color=maroon][b]1.
