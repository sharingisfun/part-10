Everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania... Dracula's rigid monster-only hotel policy has finally relaxed, opening up its doors to human guests. But behind closed coffins, Drac is worried that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, isn't showing signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis is busy visiting her human in-laws with Johnny - and in for a major cultural shock of her own - &quot;Vampa&quot; Drac enlists his friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to put Dennis through a &quot;monster-in-training&quot; boot camp. But little do they know that Drac's grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel. And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood - and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania - things are going to get batty!\r\n\r\ncast\r\n\r\nAdam Sandler:...Dracula (voice)\r\nAndy Samberg:...Jonathan (voice)\r\nSelena Gomez:...Mavis (voice)\r\nKevin James:...Frankenstein (voice)\r\nSteve Buscemi:...Wayne (voice)\r\nDavid Spade:...Griffin (voice)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat :mkv/AVC \r\nWriting Library :x264    \r\nDuration : 1h 29mn 16 \r\nBitrate :  3 300 Kbps \r\nResolution=Width/Height : 1 920  x  1 028 pixels \r\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat : AC-3 \r\nBitrate :  384 Kbps\r\nChannels :6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \r\nTitle/Year : &quot;Hotel Transylvania 2&quot; / 2015\r\nFile Size : 2.30 GiB\r\nGenre :  Animation | Comedy | Family | Fantasy \r\nSource : 1080p WEB-DL DD5 1 H264-RK [Thanks]\r\nChapters : Yes \r\nSample : Yes \r\nSubtitles(srt): EnglishArabic,Bulgarian,Chinese (3),Czech,Indonesian,Italian.\r\nSubtitles(srt): French,Greek,Hebrew,Hungarian,Icelandic,Ukrainian,Thai.\r\nSubtitles(srt): Malay,Polish,Portuguese-BR,Russian,Slovenian,Spanish.\r\nIMDB :   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2510894/\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/507 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/50c \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/501 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/50E \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/50O \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/50S\r\n\r\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|Hand_of_Doom|BADASSMEDIA|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4477c5650f771d67b19129064fe43a9fb67f9215","amp;dn":"Hotel.Transylvania.2.2015.1080p.WEBRip.AC3.x264-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4477c5650f771d67b19129064fe43a9fb67f9215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,119,197,101,15,119,29,103,177,145,41,6,79,228,58,159,182,127,146,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
