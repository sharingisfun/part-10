Those who were impacted by \nthe influence of their &quot;Into Battle&quot; EP and the &quot;(Who's Afraid Of) The Art Of Noise&quot; album will enjoy \nhearing the development of such songs as &quot;Beat Box&quot;, &quot;Close (To The Edit)&quot;, &quot;Moments In Love&quot;, \n&quot;A Time For Fear (Who's Afraid)&quot;, and &quot;Snapshot&quot;.\n\nThe booklet features interviews with all five original members (Trevor Horn, Anne Dudley, Jonathan &quot;J.J.&quot; \nJeczalik, Gary Langan, and Paul Morley) talking about their music, their goals, and their anti-image, \nsince in the early days they were represented with masks, statues, and wrenches. The reasons as to why \nare touched upon here. Also touched upon are the reasons as to why the core of the group left their \nlabel in order to find recognition and perhaps hit songs. They were able to find both, a\nnd not always with good results.\n\n&quot;And What Have You Done With My Body God&quot; features over 40 unreleased tracks on three CD's. The fourth \nCD features the complete &quot;Into Battle&quot; EP (although the mix for &quot;Moments In Love&quot; is the single edit, \nnot the full length version), along with the programs originally released on the cassingles for \n&quot;Close (To The Edit)&quot; and &quot;Moments In Love&quot;. Beat junkies, cratediggers, and bedroom producers will \nalso love the insight of some of the secrets revealed within the AoN empire. An appropriate box set \nfrom one of the best &quot;non-groups&quot; in the world.\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\n\nArtist / Group: Art Of Noise\nAlbum: And What Have You Done With My Body, God?\nGenre: Electronic / Synth-pop / Experimental\nSource: 4 x CD Box Set\nAlbum Release Year.: 2006\nLabel: ZTT\nNumber of Tracks: 59\nTotal Duration: 3:30:04\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless and MP3\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.2.1\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME 3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 765 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps (Constant Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: Scans (Plus Embedded Artwork Within FLAC / MP3 Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE Sheets, MD5, FFP, SFV, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 1.60 GB\nEncoder: BSW\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n\nCD1 - The Very Start Of Noise\n\n01.
