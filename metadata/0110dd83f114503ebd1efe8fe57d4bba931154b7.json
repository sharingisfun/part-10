Most have descriptive filenames.  You'll find wallpapers in 52 categories:\n\n105  Abstract\n225  Aircraft -- mostly modern military including the F22 Raptor\n40   America\n16   Artsy Fartsy\n67   Autumn\n104  Beaches and coasts\n63   Birds\n46   Boats\n47   Bridges\n42   Buildings -- many from Washington DC\n627  Cars -- mostly classic cars from photos taken at car shows\n39   Cats\n13   Celebrities -- I shied away from these but ended up with a few\n347  Christmas\n11   Churches -- inside and out\n63   CityScapes\n85   Comics -- South Park, Superman, Simpsons, Garfield.\n18   CountryScapes\n9    Docks and Ports\n70   Dogs\n71   Fantasy -- DND, Lord of the Rings type stuff\n39   Farms\n78   Flowers and Plants\n23   Food and Fruit\n19   Halloween\n43   Horses\n14   Insects\n134  Kincade -- Painter Thomas Kincade\n49   Lakes, Ponds, and Rivers\n35   Landmarks\n26   Linux -- Penguins, etc.\n6    Livestock\n97   Mountains\n102  Nautre -- photos that might not fit in the other categories from nature\n78   Objects -- closeups of random items\n12   Ocean\n127  Other\n24   Paintings and drawings\n22   Roads and paths\n127  Snow (and ice)\n141  Space\n49   Sports\n97   Star Trek\n11   Streams\n117  Sunsets\n16   Trains \n35   Urbia -- stuff you'd find in cities, but not cityscapes\n50   War, soldiers, and war machines, aircraft carriers\n35   Water creatures -- fish, whales, sharks, crocodiles\n60   Waterfalls\n87   Weather -- lightning, stormfronts, clouds, tornadoes, etc.\n122  Wildlife\n\nI have maintained this collection for many years, and have run it through a duplicate checker.  I cannot guarantee that there are no duplicates whatsoever, but I've made an effort to root them out.  \n\nI'm sure to some there are categories that are notably absent.  I've tried to keep this work/church/kid safe, and there is no nudity, gore, or hate speech.\n\nAs I was collecting these, I rejected wallpapers probably in the tens of thousands.  There were so many mountains, sunsets, beaches, flowers, and landscapes.  I tried to keep only those that were either unique or of exceptional quality.  One exception: the cars have not been carefully selected.  I recently added most of these, and included almost all that I had, because I figure someone who wants a car as their wallpaper probably wants a specific car.\n\nI very recently sorted these.  Previously they were all in a single folder.  I double checked my sorting, but there might be a few weird ones.  \n\nI like to use these for picture slideshow screen savers, too.\n\nPlease enjoy, and if you like it, seed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0110dd83f114503ebd1efe8fe57d4bba931154b7","amp;dn":"Wallpaper+Collection+--+3983+--+sorted+into+52+categories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0110dd83f114503ebd1efe8fe57d4bba931154b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,16,221,131,241,20,80,62,189,30,254,143,229,125,75,186,147,17,84,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
