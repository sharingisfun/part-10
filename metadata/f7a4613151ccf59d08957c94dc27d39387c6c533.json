At the same time it combines the straightforward focus on fundamentals instructors have come to expect with a modern emphasis on design and new applications. Overall coverage of basic concepts are clear and concise so that readers can easily navigate key topics. This edition includes a new case study to help illuminate the complexities of shafts and axles and a new finite elements chapter. Problem sets have been improved, with new problems added to help students progressively work through them. The book website includes ARIS, which is a homework management system that will have 90 algorithmic problems.\n\n  \nAbout the Author\nMcGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide\n\n\n\nProduct Details: \nHardcover: 1088 pages\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 8 edition (October 25, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0073312606\nISBN-13: 978-0073312606\n(19.26 MB):","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7a4613151ccf59d08957c94dc27d39387c6c533","amp;dn":"Mechanical+Engineering+Design+8th+Ed+%2CShigly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7a4613151ccf59d08957c94dc27d39387c6c533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,164,97,49,81,204,245,157,8,149,124,148,220,39,211,147,135,198,197,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
