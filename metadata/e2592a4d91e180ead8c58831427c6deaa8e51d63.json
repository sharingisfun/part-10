Drawing equally from the heavy riffing of post-Van Halen metal and the gloomy strains of post-punk, the band developed a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic numbers. They were hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands. While this dichotomy helped the group soar to multi-platinum status with their second album, 1992's Dirt, it also divided them. Guitarist Jerry Cantrell always leaned toward the mainstream, while vocalist Layne Staley was fascinated with the seamy underground. Such tension drove the band toward stardom in their early years, but following Dirt, Alice in Chains suffered from near-crippling internal tensions that kept the band off the road for the remainder of the '90s and, consequently, the group never quite fulfilled their potential.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.We Die Young\n02.Man In The Box\n03.Sea Of Sorrow\n04.Love, Hate, Love\n05.Am I Inside\n06.Brother\n07.Got Me Wrong\n08.Right Turn\n09.Rain When I Die\n10.Them Bones\n11.Angry Chair\n12.Dam That River\n13.Dirt\n14.God Smack\n15.Hate To Feel\n16.Rooster\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.No Excuses\n02.I Stay Away\n03.What The Hell Have I (Remix)\n04.A Little Bitter (Remix)\n05.Grind\n06.Heaven Beside You\n07.Again\n08.Over Now (Unplugged Version)\n09.Nutshell (Unplugged Version)\n10.Get Born Again\n11.Died\n12.Would\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n                 \n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed.****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2592a4d91e180ead8c58831427c6deaa8e51d63","amp;dn":"Alice+In+Chains+-+The+Essential+2CD+%282006%29+%5Bmp3%5D%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2592a4d91e180ead8c58831427c6deaa8e51d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,89,42,77,145,225,128,234,216,197,136,49,66,124,109,234,168,229,29,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
