Earth's defenders never surrender!\n\nPrevious torrents have run into problems of my source files hashing differently and therefore can't be completed. I tried remaking it with some variations in piece size and now my local copy rechecks 100%. So please try this (it uses the same folder as the original but I'd HIGHLY recommend backing up your files from the original torrent just in case). If this works, I'll re-make torrents for the other files.\n\nThese are HQ x264 rips from the Power Rangers Legacy Collection DVDs.\n\n \nPower Rangers Zeo (often abbreviated as PRZ, and often simply called Zeo) is the fourth season of the Power Rangers franchise. It originally aired in 1996, and is based on the Super Sentai series Chouriki Sentai Ohranger. Zeo introduced all-new Ranger costumes for the first time, a pattern that would repeat each subsequent season, in keeping with the Super Sentai source material.\n\nFollowing the release of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie, Saban had to deal with a general decline in the brand's popularity. While ratings for Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were still solid during the show's third season, consistently ranking #1 in its weekday time slot, they nevertheless fell from the show's first two seasons. Combined with declining merchandise sales, Saban was faced with the the threat of Power Rangers losing its phenomenon status.\n\nWith the fear of a continued decline, it was eventually decided that a major shakeup in the status quo was necessary. According to then-president of Saban's children entertainment division, Peter Dang, a wide number of options were considered, including the possibility of killing off major characters. Producers eventually settled on cosmetic changes (and a few casting changes), to match the source footage of Ch?riki Sentai Ohranger. This allowed a completely new range of merchandise to be released while cutting costs. Sentai footage could be heavily used again as it had early in the series' run.\n\nThis is the last season with actor David Yost on set. He had walked off the set unexpectedly during &quot;King for a Day&quot; and chose not to return. In August 2010, Yost revealed he walked off due to constant harrassment over his sexuality by the crew, directors, writers, and even producers. Billy doesn't appear, nor is even mentioned in the next three episodes. The character returns (with no reference to his absence) in the two-part episode &quot;Rangers of Two Worlds&quot;, where he is played by a different actor and the character exits the series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84d3ec47ce9fc4a314dc1f9e07eefb57a8893e53","amp;dn":"Power+Rangers+Zeo+%28Legacy+Collection+and+Beyond%29+%28fix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84d3ec47ce9fc4a314dc1f9e07eefb57a8893e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,211,236,71,206,159,196,163,20,220,31,158,7,238,251,87,168,137,62,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
