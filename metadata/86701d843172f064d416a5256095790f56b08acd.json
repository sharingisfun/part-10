Their third album since they left\nschool as many years ago feels like a confident effort to redress the\nbalance. Opener How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep, their Bright Eyesish\nTwilight soundtrack contribution, sets the template for the finer\ntracks here Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ a lilting repetition slowly builds, all bouncy\nsensitivity and earnest determination. Singer Jack Steadman's\ndistinctive voice still sounds like he's had the corners of his mouth\ntaped to his ears, but it's boosted by an elegant palate of guitar\nlayers and stadium-friendly drums, and is now more muscular than weedy.\nThere are occasional lapses into epic-indie-lite Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Beggars is Keep the\nCar Running Jr Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ but this is a strong, forward-looking record that\ndelights in its own ambition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86701d843172f064d416a5256095790f56b08acd","amp;dn":"Bombay_Bicycle_Club-A_Different_Kind_Of_Fix-2011-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86701d843172f064d416a5256095790f56b08acd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,112,29,132,49,114,240,100,212,22,165,37,96,149,121,15,86,176,138,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
