Koestler was born in Budapest and, apart from his early school years, was educated in Austria. In 1931 Koestler joined the Communist Party of Germany until, disillusioned by Stalinism, he resigned in 1938. In 1940 he published his novel Darkness at Noon, an anti-totalitarian work, which gained him international fame. Over the next 43 years from his residence in Great Britain, Koestler espoused many political causes and wrote novels, memoirs, biographies, and numerous essays. In 1968, he was awarded the Sonning Prize &quot;for outstanding contribution to European culture&quot; and, in 1972, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1976, Koestler was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and, in 1979, with terminal leukaemia. In 1983 he and his wife committed suicide at home in London.\n\n\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in ePUB format:\n\n\n* Janus - A Summing Up, 1978\n\n* The Act of Creation, 1964\n\n* The Ghost in the Machine, 1967\n\n* The Gladiators (about the revolt of Spartacus), 1939\n\n* The Invisible Writing -The Second Volume Of An Autobiography, 1932Ã¢â‚¬â€œ40, 1954\n\n* The Sleepwalkers - A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe., 1959\n\n* The Thirteenth Tribe - The Khazar Empire and Its Heritage, 1976\n\n\n\n\nRead the articles, interview, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Koestler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Koestler&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2976/the-art-of-fiction-no-80-arthur-koestler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2976/the-art-of-fiction-no-80-arthur-koestler&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/02/specials/koestler-appreciation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/02/specials/koestler-appreciation.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/02/reviews/000102.02mazowet.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/02/reviews/000102.02mazowet.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f55434cde36d8f38f7b50b78ff07b3e17580ab","amp;dn":"Arthur+Koestler+-+Fiction%2C+Autobiography+and+Others+%287+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f55434cde36d8f38f7b50b78ff07b3e17580ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,245,84,52,205,227,109,143,56,247,181,11,120,255,7,179,225,117,128,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
