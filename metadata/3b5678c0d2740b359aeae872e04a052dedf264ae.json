You can choose to scan only specific parts from folders or registry, in order to speed up the recording process.\n\nBy comparing snapshots from before and after a new program installation or execution, you can determine which files or registry entries were added, changed, or deleted.\n\nYou can create as many snapshots as you may want or need, and you can compare anytime any pair of them, having the possibility to export differences to HTML and PDF.\n\n\nSysTracer Pro\n\nSysTracer Pro is an enhanced version of SysTracer. SysTracer Pro have advanced functionality like exporting and importing snapshots, useful in order to compare snapshots taken on different computers.\n\nWith SysTracer Pro you can search for files, folders and registry information into recorded snapshots.\n\nSysTracer Pro have command line support, for automating recording snapshots and exporting snapshots differences.\n\nVisit SysTracer features section for a detailed comparison matrix between SysTracer and SysTracer Pro.\nRemote scanning - track changes from network computers\n\nSysTracer have support for remote scanning, providing you an easy way to take snapshots of your network computers.\n\nIn order to allow scanning, each computer from your network will have a SysTracer executable installed as windows service.\n\nThe management of the entire process is done from a single computer (server) with a SysTracer instance running in normal desktop mode. From this server you will be able to control each SysTracer client by selecting scan targets, sending scan commands and receiving resulted snapshots.\n\n\nPortable version\nSysTracer can be used with or without installation.\n\nUsing the portable version - without installation - you can take snapshots of your system without making any changes to the current files or Windows registry.\n\nThe application can be used directly from the HDD or from an USB flash drive.\n\n\nNew features in SysTracer version 2.8:\n\nPost filter that can be used to hide changes of irrelevant paths/items from the recorded snapshots.\nAdded PDF support for reports and snapshot export.\nFixed issues that can occur when scan filters are manually edited.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n   Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, Windows 7, XP 64-bit, Vista 64-bit, Windows 7 64-bit\n   Internet Explorer 6.0 or later\n\n\n\n\n\n      [Installation]\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  UnRar and Install Systracer x86 or x64\n\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Insert serial provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
