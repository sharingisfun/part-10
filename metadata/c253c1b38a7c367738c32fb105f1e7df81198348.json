This book is an excellent summation of general fiscal conservative political views on the key matters of the day. It is exceptionally well researched, heavily loaded with statistics, and is current through the first month of the Obama administration. Please note that this is meant to be exactly what it claims ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a manifesto. It is not the strident screed of an Anne Coulter or the diatribe of a Rush Limbaugh, nor is it the silly kiss-ass please-elect-me garbage of a candidate. This is the scholarly presentation of the ideas that attract FISCAL conservatives (and even some social conservatives). I have often heard people (generally leftists) both in person and in the media express incredulity and scornful derision that we ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“poor foolishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ people who are not thrilled with President ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ideas can actually not love those ideas. Then these same lefties go on to represent what FCL types believe with no degree of accuracy, such as claiming that if we do not care for President Obama then we must love President Bush. No more shall we allow others to misrepresent our thoughts. As Barry Goldwater did in the 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, here is a clear representation of what we believe and why we believe it. Any reader is free to disagree, but you are going to have to put in some work if you care to refute.\n\n\n\n\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFCLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ For some length of time now, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve given some thought to putting out something like this. A principal problem is that of labels, and another is the lack of room in a torrent description to write anything approaching even a SYNOPSIS of a clear manifesto. Therefore, I have decided to call this FCL (an acronym for Fiscal Conservative Libertarian) for the sake of brevity and clarity.\n\nThere are in America (and to a lesser degree in Europe) a huge number of people who would largely fit into this camp. We are the practical, the scientific, the skeptical and the truly logically analytical. We are IN NO WAY dogmatic or organized, but we generically agree to a certain extent on some core ideas. We think people who attend rallies or protests are shmucks. We think people can express their political opinions on bumperstickers are too stupid to vote. We think whenever we hear the phrase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthere ought to be a law!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that there probably shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be. We have differing opinions on abortion, gun control, the death penalty, flag burning, and gay rights, but agree categorically that such decisions ought not to be Constitutional issues and are best left to the local voters. We think that the Federal Government ought not to do much of anything other than core responsibilities, especially if they have no idea how to pay for it. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t vote with out hearts but with our heads. We are never loyal to any party. We are very pro-military, and most of us have served. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t trust any politician and we despise empty symbolism, ignorant populism, and idiotic sloganeering. We are all about practical economics, actual freedom from the leftist nannies and rightist religious police, and we like individual responsibility.\n\nPeople like me have been going nuts for a long time with the economic stupidities of our government and fellow citizens, the general inability of these to understand real long term effects, and we are sick to death of people blaming US for George Bush instead of the RELIGIOUS and SOCIAL conservatives who elected him. We are NOT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œneo-consÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdittoheadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, or lovers of Fox News, and we are sick and tired of lefties telling us we must be supporters of Limbaugh and Falwell. WE are the people who watch Penn &amp; TellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s BULLSHIT and love SOUTH PARK. We think Obama is a very nice fellow whose economic policies at best will lead America on a path in the long run to a low rent failed soft-core Socialism. Finally, we think that the 40% on either side that make up the core of the two major sides are usually reaching bad conclusions and voting stupidly because they listen to propaganda and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t truly understand some complicated issues with an honest degree of depth.\n\nTherefore, since there is no shortage of people here with an agenda (some of which borders on the insane), I am going to put out a collection of material that gives a good accounting of the fiscal conservative point of view. Some of it I personally take as gospel, some of it is merely generic. Speaking as a history and social studies teacher, I feel qualified to select materials that reflect this point of view. It is my hope that many will increase their knowledge of complicated historical and economic events by this effort. I do not seek to foster argument or win converts, but merely to explain to the right wingers why we would rather have freedom than ban abortion or marijuana, and to get it through to the left that not everyone who doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t toe their fantasy line is a flat-Earther or fascist. Most of this material will be conservative, and most will deal with economics. There will be no political diatribes from dogmatic and non-practical people (Sorry to all the Coulter and Chomsky fans) who are more intent on pushing a fantasy utopia than pursuing practical liberty.\n\nTorrent originally upped on MakeGreatMusic dot Net\n\n\nGeneral Information\n===================\n Title:                  Liberty And Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto-\n Author:                 Mark R Levin\n Read By:                Adam Grupper.\n Copyright:              2009\n Audiobook Copyright:    2009\n Genre:                  Audiobook\n Abridged:               No\n\nFile Information\n================\n Number of MP3s:         73\n Total Duration:         6:49:53\n Total MP3 Size:         282.75\n Parity Archive:         No\n Encoded At:             VBR 84-108 kbit/s 44100 Hz Joint Stereo\n ID3 Tags:               Set, v1.1, v2.3\n\n\nBook Description\n================\nConservative talk radio's fastest-growing superstar is also a New York Times best-selling phenomenon: the author of the groundbreaking critique of the Supreme Court, Men in Black, and the deeply personal dog lover's memoir Rescuing Sprite, Mark R. Levin now delivers the book that characterizes both his devotion to his more than 5 million listeners and his love of our country and the legacy of our Founding Fathers.\n\nLiberty and Tyranny is Mark R. Levin's clarion call to conservative America, a new manifesto for the conservative movement for the 21st century.\n\nIn the face of the modern liberal assault on Constitution-based values, an attack that has steadily snowballed since President Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and resulted in a federal government that is a massive, unaccountable conglomerate, the time for re-enforcing the intellectual and practical case for conservatism is now. Conservative beliefs in individual freedoms do, in the end, stand for liberty for all Americans, while liberal dictates lead to the breakdown of civilized society - in short, tyranny.\n\nLooking back to look to the future, Levin writes, Conservatism is the antidote to tyranny precisely because its principles are our founding principles. And in a series of powerful essays, Levin lays out how conservatives can counter the corrosion that has filtered into every timely issue affecting our daily lives, from the economy to health care, global warming, immigration, and more -- and illustrates how change, as seen through the conservative lens, is always prudent, and always an enhancement to individual freedom.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c253c1b38a7c367738c32fb105f1e7df81198348","amp;dn":"FCL+Series+-+Levin+-+Liberty+%26+Tyranny%3A+A+Conservative+Manifesto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c253c1b38a7c367738c32fb105f1e7df81198348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,83,193,179,138,124,54,119,56,195,47,177,5,241,231,223,129,25,131,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
