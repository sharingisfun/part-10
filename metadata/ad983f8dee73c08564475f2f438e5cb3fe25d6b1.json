Records \nProducer William E. McEuen \n \n\nLet?s Get Small (1977) was Steve Martin&amp;#039;s first album, and a major success. It included Excuse Me, a comedy bit whose title went on to become a national catch phrase. The album went platinum and peaked at #10 on the Billboard Pop Albums Chart, which is traditionally dominated by music.\n\nThis album won the Grammy Award in 1978 for Best Comedy Album.\n\n\nTrack listing\n?Ramblin&amp;#039; Man/Theme from Ramblin&amp;#039; Man&quot; ? 2:14 \n?Vegas&quot; ? 5:45 \n?Let&amp;#039;s Get Small&quot; ? 13:34 \n?Smoking&quot; ? 2:10 \n?One Way to Leave Your Lover&quot; ? 1:33 \n?Mad at My Mother&quot; ? 1:22 \n&quot;Excuse Me&quot; ? 2:32 \n&quot;Grandmother&amp;#039;s Song&quot; ? 3:33 \n&quot;Funny Comedy Gags&quot; ? 3:05 \n&quot;Closing&quot; ? 2:02 \n\n\nAn excerpt from the title cut:\n\n&quot;I&amp;#039;m on drugs. I&amp;#039;m, uh, I mean, you know what it is. What&amp;#039;s the deal, man? I like to get small. It&amp;#039;s a wild, wild drug. Very dangerous for kids though, because they get really small. I know I shouldn&amp;#039;t get small when I&amp;#039;m drivin&amp;#039;, but, uh, I was drivin&amp;#039; around the other day, you know *whistles tunefully* and a cop pulls me over. And he goes, ?Hey, are you small?? I said, ?No, I&amp;#039;m tall, I&amp;#039;m tall.? He said, &amp;#039;Well, I&amp;#039;m gonna have to measure you.&amp;#039; They&amp;#039;ve got a little test they give you; it&amp;#039;s a balloon, and if you can get inside of it, they know... you&amp;#039;re small. And they can&amp;#039;t put you in a regular cell either, because you walk right out.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n---------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSteve Martin is my favourite comedian, and even if you&amp;#039;re put off by the likes of Cheaper By the Dozen or the new Pink Panther films, (the latter I actually didn&amp;#039;t mind) don&amp;#039;t worry ! His stand-up is nothing like that.\n\nHis stand-up career was short and sweet and shows a different side to Steve&amp;#039;s comedy; I&amp;#039;d say his career as a stand-up comic is very different from his movies in the 80s and certainly his movies today.\n\nIn his act, in a sense he plays a much more arrogant and stupid version of himself, in the style Larry David uses in Curb Your Enthusiasm. Lines like &amp;#039;I know what you&amp;#039;re saying; Steve, how can you be so fucking funny?&amp;#039; are hilarious when he says it like he actually means it. His act is interspersed with banjo playing and surreal anecdotes; one of his main objectives in stand-up was to make the audience laugh without including punchlines in his jokes.\n\n\nEnjoy !\n\n\nYou&amp;#039;ll like this if you like Steven Wright, Rodney Dangerfield, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David.\n\n\nAlso if you do like this, go and buy Steve Martin&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Born Standing Up&amp;#039;, his autobiography charting his rise to fame and why he left stand-up for film, it&amp;#039;s a great book.\n\n\n\n\nJimmy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad983f8dee73c08564475f2f438e5cb3fe25d6b1","amp;dn":"Steve+Martin%2C+Let%5C%27s+Get+Small+%5BComedy+Album%2C+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad983f8dee73c08564475f2f438e5cb3fe25d6b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,152,63,141,238,115,192,133,100,71,95,47,67,142,92,179,254,37,214,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
