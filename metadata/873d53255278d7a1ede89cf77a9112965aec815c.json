Tensions between Chinese and Japanese, plus U.S. racism, mark the tale. Hero marries Jade, leaves her in China when he goes to America as an indentured servant, rebels against cruel labor conditions, and is joined by her in New York City where she has twins. Jump ahead 16 years: their son Sword comes to New York looking for his father. There, Sword hears many stories of his father, which we see in flashbacks, and the stage is set for the battle with Invincible.\n\nDirector: Wai-keung Lau\nWriters: Manfred Wong, Wing-Shing Ma (comic book)\nStars: Ekin Cheng, Qi Shu and Kristy Yang","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873d53255278d7a1ede89cf77a9112965aec815c","amp;dn":"A+Man+Called+Hero+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873d53255278d7a1ede89cf77a9112965aec815c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,61,83,37,82,120,215,161,237,232,156,247,122,145,18,150,90,236,129,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
