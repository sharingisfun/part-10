This band, DIABLO BLVD, named after a Corrosion Of Conformity song, lead by notorious stand-up comedian and above all music devotee Alex Agnew, quickly started to turn heads. With current and ex-members of bands like A Brand, Born From Pain and Meuris, this eclectic five-piece started playing shows to appreciative crowds all over Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34eaf1d313f13a7f767a7e7b17035ba4c2ef90f4","amp;dn":"Diablo+Blvd+-+The+greater+God+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34eaf1d313f13a7f767a7e7b17035ba4c2ef90f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,234,241,211,19,241,58,127,118,122,126,123,23,3,91,164,194,239,144,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
