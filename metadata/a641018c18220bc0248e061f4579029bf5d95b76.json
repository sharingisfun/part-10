I have scanned it with OCR, bookmarks &amp; covers.\n\nIt is the aim of this book to help those who have to teach themselves some Statistics to an understanding of some of the fundamental ideas and mathematics involved. Once that has been acquired, problems of application are the more readily and successfully tackled. For this reason, and for reasons of space, the concentration has been on fundamentals. But Statistics is a dynamic, developing science. New techniques, new methods of analysis are constantly arising and influencing even the foundations. The standard of mathematics assumed is not high. Occasion-ally the algebra may appear to be a little tedious, but it is not difficult. A set of Exercises concludes each chapter, except the first. A desk calculator is not essential, but if the student can possibly obtain one he should certainly do so.\n\nFollowing the death of Richard Goodman in 1966 I have been entrusted with the task of preparing the new edition of this excellent little book. Obsolete or obsolescent units have been changed to metric units, some misprints have been corrected and the setting improved in a few places. - C. G.
