Those first methods blur the image and the edges of it. Those methods can be called local blurring because it only take into account a small number of pixels near to the processed one.\n Blurring the edges of a image is not usually accepted, and then come the bilateral filter which take into account the distance from each point to the processed one in color and position. This is probably the method more usual today. \n\n- Decomposition filtering\n Another kind of methods was based on decomposing the image and filtering it, FFT wavelets and DCT. From those methods, wavelets are actually more used. It gives a good relation between smoothing and preservation of edges. \n\n- Non local Means\n A recent method which not only reduces noise but also defects and scratches. For medium/low noise images this is the best method.  \n\n- Nonlinear Diffusion\n This family of methods are based on the diffusion equation. Those methods are used mainly in the area on medical image processing. The included one is Anisotropic diffusion.\n\nInfo: \n\n- Copy .8bf file to PhotoshopPlug-ins folder.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/27178892938615321780.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/27178892938615321780.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26fb241160dd259f1d48af6f211d394e1a9c7df5","amp;dn":"Ximagic+Denoiser+MP+3.2.11+%5BENG%5D%5BFull%5D%5BPhotoshop+Plugin%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26fb241160dd259f1d48af6f211d394e1a9c7df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,251,36,17,96,221,37,159,29,72,175,111,33,29,57,78,26,156,125,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
