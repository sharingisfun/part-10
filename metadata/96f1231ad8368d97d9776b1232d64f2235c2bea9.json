Many of the phenomena around us can be described by mathematics. Mathematical concepts are even inherent in the structure of living cells.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f1231ad8368d97d9776b1232d64f2235c2bea9","amp;dn":"The+Joy+of+Mathematics%3A+Discovering+Mathematics+All+Around+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f1231ad8368d97d9776b1232d64f2235c2bea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,241,35,26,216,54,141,151,217,119,107,18,50,214,79,34,53,194,190,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
