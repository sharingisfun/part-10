They want nothing more than to sail into the tropical sunset and leave their troubles behind for one blissful week. But where Emily, Aria, Spencer, and Hanna go, A goes, too. From scuba diving to tanning on the upper deck, A is there, soaking up all their new secrets.\n\nEmily is smooching a stowaway. Aria's treasure-hunting partner is a little too interested in her booty. Spencer's going overboard trying to land a new boy. And a blast--or rather, a crash--from Hanna's past could mean rough waters ahead for everyone.\n\nThe liars better tighten their life jackets. A perfect storm is brewing, and if they aren't careful, A will bury them at sea. .\nFor more quality uploads, please visit my profile and my thread :\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nDovah\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c53a0f08d5581f9b1db9db1cb43715df870aad","amp;dn":"Sara+Shepard%2C+Burned+%28Pretty+Little+Liars+12%29+epub+mobi+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c53a0f08d5581f9b1db9db1cb43715df870aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,197,58,15,8,213,88,31,155,29,185,219,28,180,55,21,223,135,10,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
