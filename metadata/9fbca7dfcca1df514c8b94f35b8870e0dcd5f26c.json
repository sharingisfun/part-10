They originally began in 1962 as a musical theatre troupe, however the formation of the band was not until 1967. They are known for their ties to avant-garde theater groups (as typified by Shuji Terayama's troupe) and leftist political groups, as well as for their feedback heavy live shows. The band's style is typified by simple, repeated bass lines, shrieking guitar feedback and folk arrangement.\n\nHeavier than a Death in the Family\n\n01 - Strung Out Deeper Than the Night\t15:33\n\n02 - The Night Collectors              \t08:32\n\n03 - Night of the Assassins      \t12:08\n\n04 - Enter the Mirror           \t11:45\n\n05 - People Can Choose           \t10:33\n\n06 - Ice Fire                   \t16:13\n\nTotal time:                             74:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fbca7dfcca1df514c8b94f35b8870e0dcd5f26c","amp;dn":"Les+Rallizes+D%26eacute%3Bnud%26eacute%3Bs+-+Heavier+Than+a+Death+in+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fbca7dfcca1df514c8b94f35b8870e0dcd5f26c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,188,167,223,204,161,223,81,76,139,148,243,91,136,112,224,220,213,242,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
