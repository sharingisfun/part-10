Full-color action illustrations, contemporary markings, and performance data tables vividly show what might have been achieved.

This new addition takes a close look at a varied range of aircraft types, principally described as ground-attack and special-purpose types, but which includes KampfzerstÃƒÂ¶rer (multi-purpose combat aircraft), multi-purpose and fast bombers, explosive-carrying aircraft intended to attack other aircraft, air-to-air ramming vehicles, bomb-carrying gliders and towed fighters, and airborne weapons and special devices (rockets, cannons, flame-throwers, etc.) \n\nAs in the first two volumes, the technical descriptions and histories of about 140 aircraft types are brought to life by many specially created full-color artworks, showing the projects, often in unit markings, as they might have appeared if they had come to fruition and/or if the war had continued beyond 1945. This series has proven indispensable for historians and notably for modelers, whose imaginations are fired up by these revelations.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Luftwaffe-Projects-Special-Purpose-Aircraft/dp/1857801504/ref=pd_sim_b_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Luftwaffe-Projects-Special-Purpose-Aircraft/dp/1857801504/ref=pd_sim_b_3&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb5d40546d17d69477906e1896de19740d6125cd","amp;dn":"Luftwaffe+Secret+Projects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb5d40546d17d69477906e1896de19740d6125cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,93,64,84,109,23,214,148,119,144,110,24,150,222,25,116,13,97,37,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
