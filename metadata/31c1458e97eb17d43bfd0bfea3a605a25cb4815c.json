The powers that be have instituted...some changes. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen have been disbanded and disavowed, and the country is under the control of an iron-fisted regime. Now, after many years, the still youthful Mina Murray and a rejuvenated Allan Quatermain return and are in search of some answers. Answers that can only be found in a book buried deep in the vaults of their old headquarters, a book that holds the key to the hidden history of the League throughout the ages: The Black Dossier. As Allan and Mina delve into the details of their precursors, some dating back centuries, they must elude their dangerous pursuers who are Hell-bent on retrieving the lost manuscript... and ending the League once and for all.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c1458e97eb17d43bfd0bfea3a605a25cb4815c","amp;dn":"The+League+of+Extraordinary+Gentlemen%3A+The+Black+Dossier+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c1458e97eb17d43bfd0bfea3a605a25cb4815c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,193,69,142,151,235,23,212,59,253,11,254,163,166,5,162,92,180,129,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
