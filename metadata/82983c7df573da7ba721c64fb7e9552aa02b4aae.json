First, Guy swings by a NY-style deli crankin' out old-fashioned chicken noodle with matzo ball soup and potato latkes. Then, he's off to San Fran's food truck park, where the reinvented Japanese/Korean truck hooks Guy up with a totally unique take on Asian-fusion in the pork belly and short rib kojas. And the food extravaganza ends at a repurposed garage in the Mission District for some southern hospitality served up in braised beef short ribs and spicy shrimp and gravy.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 09-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82983c7df573da7ba721c64fb7e9552aa02b4aae","amp;dn":"Diners.Drive-Ins.and.Dives.S18E03.San+Francisco.HDTV.x264-CRiMSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82983c7df573da7ba721c64fb7e9552aa02b4aae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,152,60,125,245,115,218,123,167,33,198,79,183,233,85,42,160,43,74,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
