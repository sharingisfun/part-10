Deep feelings, fine nuancing without emotionalism or too much sweetness; Nothing is compromised here, also not in the playing of the pianist, who gives shape to the frequently virtuoso piano part in an exceptionally transparent way, so that the cello very rarely, and if so only slightly, retreats to the background. Besides the cello sonata smaller pieces were heard, including the famous &quot;Vocalise&quot;, an &quot;Elegie&quot;, and the Romance opus 4/3. Here once again both interpreters play with great verve and large imagination.&quot;\r\n\r\nSonata for cello and piano in G minor Op. 19\r\n01. I. Lento - Allegro moderato [13.36]\r\n02. II.
