Most wanted to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœkill the messengerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ because their having been so conned by the alleged Ã¢â‚¬ËœauthoritiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for their entire lives was too painful to contemplate. Those with neither eyes to see nor ears to hear wanted to argue with me. Many suggested they were aware, yet upon further discussion they admitted to not really knowing.\nOur mind is of 3 categories: what we know, what we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know, and what we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know. Not knowing is unfortunate; not knowing that we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know is tragic. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ W. Erhart.\nSome actually did know about the fraudulent banking system and yet felt already defeated. They remain part of the problem by refusing to become part of the solution.\nThe ultimate ignorance is the rejection of something you know nothing about and refuse to investigate.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Dr. Wayne Dyer\nI concluded that, unfortunately, only a few want to hear how to become free, stop identifying with their false beliefs, do what they want to do (instead of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœworking for a livingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), and live in joy which is what we are designed to do. I felt as if I were my own minority group Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I truly do want to know that which I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to know. Most want security over freedom. As most people identify with their beliefs, giving them up would present the fear, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwho would I BE?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ If they were to open their minds, drop their preconceived notions and their psychological prejudices, let go of the concept that their beliefs are who they are, they might become enlightened.\nMillions of unconscious people are not taking responsibility for their inner peace. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eckhart Tolle.\nNeedless to say, suggesting we have been conned into playing an insidious game which is destroying our lives, our futures, our fellowship, our spirituality, and our true natures, will meet with non-receptive minds. Consequently, in exasperation one night I resolved that my book would be futile Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a waste of my time and energy. I declared I would put my efforts back into developing my Energy Psychology practice. In the middle of the night I was awakened by a voice saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secret Oral TeachingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I thought, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll rememberÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and went back to sleep. Later I heard it again, and then again upon awakening I heard, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secret Oral TeachingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at which point I leapt out of bed and went to my books and put my hand on a small brown book which IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d owned for 20 years and never read, entitled, Secret Oral Teachings in Tibetan Buddhist Sects by Alexandra David-NÃƒÂ©el and Lama Yongden (1967). Within the first eight pages I read about the hesitation of the Buddha, before beginning His Mission:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I have discovered a profound truth, difficult to perceive, difficult to understand, accessible only to the wise.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Human beings busy themselves in the vortex of the world and find their pleasure. It will be difficult for men to understand the law of the concatenation of causes and effects, the suppression of the samskaras (ideas that one forms which depend upon ignorance).\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Of what use to reveal to men that which I have discovered at the price of laborious efforts? Why should I do so? Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This doctrine cannot be understood by those filled by desire and hatred .. it is mysterious, deep; hidden from the vulgar mind. If I proclaim it and men are unable to understand it, the only result will be fatigue and annoyance for me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nBrahma Sahampati exhorts the Buddha to conquer His hesitation:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“May the Venerable One preach the Doctrine! There are beings whose spiritual eyes are hardly darkened by light dust, these will understand the Doctrine. In the land of Magadha a false doctrine has prevailed up to the present, elaborated by men whose minds were contaminated (by ignorance). Now open to them the gate of Immortality (literally, of the deathless).\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Arise, O Victorious One ! Travel through-out the world, O Chief of Pilgrims (beings who wander in the round of successive births and deaths). There are some who will understand Thee.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe Buddha insisted strongly on the necessity of examining the propositions put forward by Him, and of understanding them personally before accepting them as true. The ancient texts leave no doubt on this point:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Do not believe on the strength of traditions even if they have been held in honour for many generations and in many places; do not believe anything because many people speak of it; do not believe on the strength of sages of old times; do not believe that which you have yourselves imagined, thinking that a god has inspired you. Believe nothing which depends only on the authority of your masters or of priests. After investigation, believe that which you have yourselves tested and found reasonable, and which is for your good and that of others.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Doubt is an incitement to research, and research is the path to true knowledge.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Why are these teachings secret? Does that mean I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write and tell about them?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“No, Alexandra, these teachings are not called Ã¢â‚¬ËœsecretÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ because it is forbidden to talk about them. They are Ã¢â‚¬ËœsecretÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ because so few who hear them understand.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n***\nImmediately I began writing, yet from a completely different perspective from my previous attempts. Following is the result of this inspiration. I ask that you take the BuddhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suggestion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“investigate, believe what is reasonable and for your good and that of others.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nI was asked Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but there no words: it was a straight mental instantaneous communication Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhat had I done to benefit or advance the human race? Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sogyal Rinpoche\nI have determined that writing this book is my responsibility.\n***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a48928ffccbeec6b2497f93e805e3e11782a4a0","amp;dn":"HOW+I+CLOBBERED+EVERY+BUREAUCRATIC+CASH-CONFISCATORY+AGENCY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a48928ffccbeec6b2497f93e805e3e11782a4a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,72,146,143,252,203,238,198,178,73,127,147,232,5,227,225,23,130,164,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
