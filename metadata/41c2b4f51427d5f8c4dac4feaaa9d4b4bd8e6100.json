Old Joy 3:33\n\nOn The First Days of Spring, Charlie Fink mourned the absence of ex-girlfriend/ex-bandmate Laura Marling while the rest of Noah &amp; the Whale churned up a sympathetic mix of folk and sad-eyed indie rock. Released two years later, Last Night on Earth finds the band recharged and redirected. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe used to be somebody, now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s someone elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and it feels like heaven,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fink sings on the opening track, a tribute to transformation that doubles as the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mission statement. Although released during the golden days of EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s indie folk scene, Last Night on Earth reaches far beyond the genre, relying heavily on keyboards and leaving the acoustic riffage to Mumford &amp; Sons. Some of the basslines are synthesized instead of plucked, and some of the percussion is programmed instead of played. At times, the band appears single-minded in its determination to turn over a new rock, and the album suffers whenever Last Night on Earth focuses on presentation -- the polished production, the overdubbed handclaps -- instead of content. But those moments are few and far between. Noah &amp; the Whale sound genuinely happy to be exploring a new direction, and tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the Kind of NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ fuse the Arcade FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chest-swelling anthems with smart, radio-ready sensibilities. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWild Thing,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fink proves he can still wring some serious mileage out of melancholy, too, delivering a Matt Berninger-like vocal over synths and lonely guitar lines. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41c2b4f51427d5f8c4dac4feaaa9d4b4bd8e6100","amp;dn":"Noah+And+The+Whale...Last+Night+On+Earth%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41c2b4f51427d5f8c4dac4feaaa9d4b4bd8e6100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,194,180,245,20,39,213,248,196,218,196,254,170,169,212,180,189,142,97,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
