Despite rare and clumsy efforts to rev it up (&quot;After screaming through space at sixteen thousand miles per hourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦&quot;), the prose is as dry as the Martian surface, and several of the accompanying, faded-looking black-and-white photos or diagrams add neither information nor insight. Still, determined readers will find plenty of current information, plus a strongly made case for sending humans to Mars, and, to close, particularly thorough and useful resource lists. While Seymour Simon's Destination: Mars (HarperCollins, 2000) or Stuart Murray and Edward S. Barnard's Mars (DK, 2004) have far superior browser appeal, Parks's book is a suitable choice for deeper subject collections.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:092a34324b4b8954c897c35652624dbdecc2258d","amp;dn":"Exploring+Mars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"092a34324b4b8954c897c35652624dbdecc2258d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,42,52,50,75,75,137,84,200,151,195,86,82,98,77,189,236,194,37,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
