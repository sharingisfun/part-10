The good-looking one is one-hundred-year-old ex-seminarian and &quot;roads&quot; scholar Travis O'Hearn. The green one is Catch, a demon with a nasty habit of eating most of the people he meets. Behind the fake Tudor faÃƒÂ§ade of Pine Cove, California, Catch sees a four-star buffet. Travis, on the other hand, thinks he sees a way of ridding himself of his toothy traveling companion. The winos, neo-pagans, and deadbeat Lotharios of Pine Cove, meanwhile, have other ideas. And none of them is quite prepared when all hell breaks loose.\n\nThe Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove (Pine Cove #2)\nThe town psychiatrist has decided to switch everybody in Pine Cove, California, from their normal antidepressants to placebos, so naturallyÃ¢â‚¬â€well, to be accurate, artificiallyÃ¢â‚¬â€business is booming at the local blues bar. Trouble is, those lonely slide-guitar notes have also attracted a colossal sea beast named Steve with, shall we say, a thing for explosive oil tanker trucks. Suddenly, morose Pine Cove turns libidinous and is hit by a mysterious crime wave, and a beleaguered constable has to fight off his own gonzo appetites to find out what's wrong and what, if anything, to do about it.\n\nThe Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror (Pine Cove #3)\n'Twas the night (okay, more like the week) before Christmas, and all through the tiny community of Pine Cove, California, people are busy buying, wrapping, packing, and generally getting into the holiday spirit.\nBut not everybody is feeling the joy. Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.\nBut hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say &quot;Kris Kringle,&quot; he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c45b7b9423672af16a78a7d7fcc95e5234745b37","amp;dn":"Pine+Cove+series+by+Christopher+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c45b7b9423672af16a78a7d7fcc95e5234745b37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,91,123,148,35,103,42,241,106,120,167,215,252,201,94,82,52,116,91,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
