In The Burning Wire, a \nmysterious killer has seized control of New York CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power grid to create \nviolent, deadly electrical attacks that turn everyday objects into weapons of \nmass estruction. And as the suspected terrorist begins making outrageous demands, \nRhyme and his team know the time to stop him is running short.\n - - -\n\nFrom JefferyDeaver.com:\n\nLincoln Rhyme is back, on the trail of a killer whose weapon of choice cripples \nNew York City with fear.\n\nThe weapon is invisible and omnipresent.  Without it, modern society grinds to a \nhalt.  It is the electrical grid.  The killer harnesses and steers huge arc \nflashes with voltage so high, and heat so searing, that steel melts and his \nvictims are set afire, or subtly reconnects a few wires in one's house or office \nso that the bathtub, the sink, the computer keyboard, the simple desk lamp can \nkill.\n\nWhen the first horrific attack occurs in broad daylight, reducing a city bus to a \npile of molten, shrapnel-riddled metal, officials fear terrorism.  Rhyme, a \nworld-class forensic criminologist known for his successful apprehension of the \nmost devious criminals, is immediately tapped for the investigation.  Long a \nquadriplegic, he assembles NYPD detective Amelia Sachs and officer Ron Pulaski as \nhis eyes and ears and legs on crime sites, and FBI agent Fred Dellray as his \nundercover man on the street.  As the attacks continue across the city at a \nsickening pace, and terrifying demand letters begin appearing, the team works \ndesperately against time and with maddeningly little forensic evidence to try to \nfind the killer.   Or is it killers....?\n\nMeanwhile, Rhyme is consulting on another high-profile investigation in Mexico \nwith a most coveted quarry in his cross-hairs:  the hired killer known as the \nWatchmaker, one of the few criminals to have eluded Rhyme's net.\n\nJuggling two massive investigations against a cruel ticking clock takes a toll on \nRhyme's health.  Soon Rhyme is fighting on yet another front -- and his \ndetermination to work despite his physical limitations threatens to drive away \nhis closest allies when he needs them most.\n- - -\n\nAwards: AudioFile Earphones Award\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d705a58ad522175e86669667359c1c537401ecf","amp;dn":"THE+BURNING+WIRE+-+Jeffery+Deaver.+Dennis+Boutsikaris+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d705a58ad522175e86669667359c1c537401ecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,112,90,88,173,82,33,117,232,102,105,102,115,89,193,197,55,64,30,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
