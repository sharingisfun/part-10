The acting was good but the young boy deserves great credit making his role believable. It is nice to see an alternate Xmas film doing what is a very limited run in Britain. There is much joy to behold in this film from the beautiful locations, the music score which enhanced the film and made it feel a much bigger picture and not forgetting an edit that did not add any silly modernistic cuts/editing style. I thought the ending just about summed up the film, dark black humour Finnish style, I hope this becomes a wee cult classic in the future. Go see it!\n\nSCREENS:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pacpiaadn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pacpiaadn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pacpjaadn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pacpjaadn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pacpkaadn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pacpkaadn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSeed and enjoy folks!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01ba63333caef0d277775af58374782f6c815b12","amp;dn":"Rare+Exports+%282010%29+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01ba63333caef0d277775af58374782f6c815b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,186,99,51,60,174,240,210,119,119,90,245,131,116,120,47,108,129,91,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
