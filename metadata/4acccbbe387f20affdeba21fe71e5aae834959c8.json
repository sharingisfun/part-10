Samberg was hired as a cast member, with Schaffer and Taccone as writers for the series in late 2005. After the quick production and national success of &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, the comedians began writing and recording tracks for their debut album.\nCollaborators on the album include T-Pain, Norah Jones, Jack Black, E-40, Julian Casablancas, Sly &amp; Robbie, DJ Nu-Mark, J-Zone, Natalie Portman, Chris Parnell, and Justin Timberlake.[2] [FROM WIKIPEDIA]\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Who Said WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Wack?\n2 Santana DVX [ft.
