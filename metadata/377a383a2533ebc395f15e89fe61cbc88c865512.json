The authors rebut claims that range from atheism being just another religion to the alleged atrocities committed in its name.\n\n* An accessible yet scholarly commentary on hot-button issues in the debate over religious belief\n* Teaches critical thinking skills through detailed, rational argument\n* Objectively considers each myth on its merits\n* Includes a history of atheism and its advocates, an appendix detailing atheist organizations, and an extensive bibliography\n* Explains the differences between atheism and related concepts such as agnosticism and naturalism\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;I recommend it as useful reading both to those who are freethinkers (whatever they call themselves, be it atheists, agnostics or secularists) and to &quot;believers&quot;, particularly the hard-core religious ones, though it might prove &quot;heavy-going&quot; for them at times, and they are unlikely to be able to suspend belief and permit scepticism to intrude into their &quot;blind faith&quot;.&quot;\n--New Nurturing Potential, 1 September 2013\n\n&quot;I am happy to report that Blackford and SchÃƒÂ¼klenkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collaboration has given us an intellectually rigorous yet compositionally relaxed book. It is clearly written, clear-headed, and amusing on occasion (especially with the inclusion of comics from the Jesus &amp; Mo website). It is simply organized, as the title indicates, with the authors taking on the 50 Myths one by one.&quot;\n--Neworld Review, Vol 6.
