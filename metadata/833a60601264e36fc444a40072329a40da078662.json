Merrick is training for the title shot in the heavyweight division as a mixed martial artist and can't afford distractions, but neither can he turn his back on the woman who tugs at his heartstrings.\n\nElle feels safe with her two protectors, and the longer she spends with them, the more she realizes that she has no desire to remember her past. Not when it could compromise her future with Cade and Merrick.\n\nCade has his own set of concerns when it comes to Elle, and it quickly becomes clear to the two men that for the first time in their friendship, a woman is coming between them. But what if they just kept her there? Between them. Where she belongs.\n\nAuthor:\n\nMaya Banks is the pen name for Sharon Long. Escaping into the pages of a book is something she's loved to do since she was a child. Now she crafts her own worlds and characters and enjoys spending as much time with them as possible. A southern girl born and bred, she loves life below the Mason Dixon, and more importantly, loves bringing southern characters and settings to life in her stories.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:833a60601264e36fc444a40072329a40da078662","amp;dn":"Theirs+to+Keep+%5BTangled+Hearts+%231%5D%5B2013%5D%5BMaya+Banks%5D%5Bmobi%2Fepub%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"833a60601264e36fc444a40072329a40da078662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,58,96,96,18,100,227,111,196,68,164,0,114,50,154,64,218,7,134,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
