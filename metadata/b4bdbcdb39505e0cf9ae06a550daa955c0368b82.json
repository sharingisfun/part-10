Hazlewood spent his teenage years in Port Neches, TX where he was exposed to a rich Gulf Coast music tradition. Hazlewood studied for a medical degree at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He served with the United States Army during the Korean War.\n\nHazlewood is perhaps most famous for writing the Nancy Sinatra hit, &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&amp;#039;.&quot; But Hazlewood&amp;#039;s own output has also achieved a cult status in the underground rock scene, with songs covered by artists such as Lydia Lunch, Einsturzende Neubauten, Nick Cave and Boyd Rice.\n\nHazlewood has a distinctive baritone voice that adds an ominous resonance to his music. Hazlewood&amp;#039;s collaborations with Nancy Sinatra as well as his solo output in the late 1960s and early 1970s have been praised as an essential contribution to a sound often described as &amp;#039;Cowboy Psychedelia&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;Saccharine Underground&amp;#039;. In 2006 Lee sung for Bela B&amp;#039;s first solo album &quot;Bingo&quot; the song &quot;Lee Hazlewood und das erste Lied des Tages&quot; (&quot;Lee Hazlewood and the first song of the day&quot;).\n\nAlbums:\n\n1.
