One of the trance scenes true legends \n  MWNN seals his reputation as a master craftsman with this superbly \n  produced piece of work. The production across these nine tracks is \n  second to none, and a handful of trance tastemakers lucky enough to \n  receive copies have already have been blown away. Martin's long and \n  illustrious career, began way back in 1988 when his track Urban Acid \n  (Polydor) sold over 65,000 copies, he followed this by releasing 1993's \n  &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; for early trance label &quot;Concept in Dance&quot;. 1994 saw \n  Martin fall in with Youth's cutting edge trance label - Dragonfly where \n  he recorded the definitive psy-trance anthem &quot;Teleport&quot;,which still \n  recides in Paul Oakenfolds top three tunes of all time. In 1998 MWNN was \n  snapped up Oakenfold's Perfecto (East West) where he released the \n  critically acclaimed album &quot;Earth moving the sun&quot; which included the \n  underground club anthem &quot;Sugar Rush&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91e1ec72cde728b198c65c5c5a8f4f9b21b4719f","amp;dn":"Man+With+No+Name+-+Interstate+Highway-2003-MYCEL+%5BGoatrance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91e1ec72cde728b198c65c5c5a8f4f9b21b4719f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,225,236,114,205,231,40,177,152,198,92,92,90,143,79,155,33,180,113,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
