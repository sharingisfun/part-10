Traitor to His Class sheds new light on FDR's formative years, his remarkable willingness to champion the concerns of the poor and disenfranchised, his combination of political genius, firm leadership, and matchless diplomacy in saving democracy in America during the Great Depression and the American cause of freedom in World War II.\n\nDrawing on archival materials, public speeches, personal correspondence, and accounts by family and close associates, acclaimed bestselling historian and biographer H. W. Brands offers a compelling and intimate portrait of RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and career.\n\nBrands explores the powerful influence of FDRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dominating mother and the often tense and always unusual partnership between FDR and his wife, Eleanor, and her indispensable contributions to his presidency. Most of all, the book traces in breathtaking detail FDRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary efforts with his New Deal legislation to transform the American political economy in order to save it, his forcefulÃ¢â‚¬â€and cageyÃ¢â‚¬â€leadership before and during World War II, and his lasting legacy in creating the foundations of the postwar international order.\n\nTraitor to His Class brilliantly captures the qualities that have made FDR a beloved figure to millions of Americans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04fb699eda3de32482babc7a325607d220952059","amp;dn":"Traitor+to+His+Class-+The+Privileged+Life+and+Radical+Presidency","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04fb699eda3de32482babc7a325607d220952059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,251,105,158,218,61,227,36,130,186,188,122,50,86,7,210,32,149,32,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
