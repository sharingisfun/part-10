But the similarities pretty much end there. SakamotoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo work runs to a sort of light contemporary classical music, and his collaborations have tended to be with pop musicians. On N.D.E., Hosono teams up with a host of sidemen both famous (bassist Bill Laswell) and obscure (saxophonist Yasuaki Shimizu, violinist Arun Bagal) to create a beautiful, funky, and yet strangely creepy collage of electronic beats, modal melodies, and exotic samples. Not surprisingly, LaswellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s is the strongest presence here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNavigationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he pretty much takes over with his trademark punchy basslines and samples of North African ululations, while the textures and drones of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEdge of the EndÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recall his own Hear No Evil album of a few years earlier. Another strong voice here is that of Bagal, whose keening modal violin make ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStrange AttractorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ two of the most compelling items on this album. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42837bcf204aef82f2f60abd021f4a2be3693829","amp;dn":"Haruomi+Hosono+-+1995+-+NDE+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42837bcf204aef82f2f60abd021f4a2be3693829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,131,123,207,32,74,239,130,242,246,10,189,2,31,74,43,227,105,56,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
