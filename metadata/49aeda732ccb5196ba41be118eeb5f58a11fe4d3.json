His job? Professional Ã¢â‚¬Å“cleaner.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nothing too violent, just disposing of bodies, doing a little cleanup if necessary. But in Brett BattlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electrifying debut novel, QuinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest assignment will change everything, igniting a harrowing journey of violence, betrayal, and revenge.\n\nThe job seemed simple enough: investigating a suspicious case of arson. But when a dead body turns up where it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t belongÃ¢â‚¬â€œand QuinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s handlers at Ã¢â‚¬Å“the OfficeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ turn strangely silentÃ¢â‚¬â€œhe knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in over his head. With only a handful of clues, Quinn scrambles for cover, struggling to find out why someone wants him dead . . . and if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s linked to a larger attempt to wipe out the Office.\n\n\n                              Book 01 - The Cleaner\n\n                              Book 02 - The Deceived\n\n                              Book 03 - Shadow of Betrayal\n\n                              Book 04 - The Silenced\n\n                              Book 05 - The Destroyed\n\n                              Book 06 - The Collected\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49aeda732ccb5196ba41be118eeb5f58a11fe4d3","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Quinn+Series+by+Brett+Battles+%28Books+1+to+6%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49aeda732ccb5196ba41be118eeb5f58a11fe4d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,174,218,115,44,203,81,150,186,65,190,17,142,235,95,88,161,31,228,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
