Stanton. \nISBN 978-0-9565421-0-6 (print) &amp; 978-0-9565421-1-3 (PDF)\nPublisher: Requisite Variety \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s applicable across product, service, interaction and architectural design, aimed at socially and environmentally beneficial behaviour change. The patterns are drawn from a range of disciplines, and are phrased as questions or provocations to enable the toolkitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s use as both a brainstorming tool and a guide for exploring the field of design for behaviour change. \n\nThe toolkitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in use by industry, public sector and educational organisations worldwide, and Requisite Variety also offers workshops and consultancy using it, as well as exploring other aspects of design for behaviour change, and the interface between people and technology. \n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re heading into a world of increasingly complex engineered systems in everyday life, from smart cities, smart electricity grids and networked infrastructure on the one hand, to ourselves, personally, being always connected to each other: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going to be just an Internet of Things, but very much an Internet of Things and People, and Communities, too.\n\nYet there is a disconnect between the potential quality of life benefits for society, and peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding of theseÃ¢â‚¬Å Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å often invisibleÃ¢â‚¬Å Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å systems around us. How do they work? Who runs them? What can they help me do? How can they help my community?\n\nIoT technology and the ecosystems around it could enable behaviour change for social and environmental sustainability in a wide range of areas, from energy use to civic engagement and empowerment. But the systems need to be intelligible, for people to be engaged and make the most of the opportunities and possibilities for innovation and progress.\n\nThey need to be designed with people at the heart of the process, and that means designing with people themselves: practical co-creation, and constructionist public engagement where people can explore these systems and learn how they work in the context of everyday life rather than solely in the abstract visions of city planners and technology companies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033c01b8c88d928d9b53cd81dc805ce095ef5606","amp;dn":"Design+With+Intent+To+Control+%28110p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033c01b8c88d928d9b53cd81dc805ce095ef5606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,60,1,184,200,141,146,141,155,83,205,129,220,128,92,224,149,239,86,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
