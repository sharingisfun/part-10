It provides a thorough introduction to the three areas of spectrometry most widely used in spectrometric identification: mass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. A how-to, hands-on teaching manual with considerably expanded NMR coverage--NMR spectra can now be intrepreted in exquisite detail. This book:\r\n* Uses a problem-solving approach with extensive reference charts and tables.\r\n* Offers an extensive set of real-data problems offers a challenge to the practicing chemist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:622e8afdf221f13243b1c649379594d7eadb6838","amp;dn":"Spectrometric+Identification+of+Organic+Compounds+7th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"622e8afdf221f13243b1c649379594d7eadb6838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,46,138,253,242,33,241,50,67,177,198,73,55,149,148,215,234,219,104,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
