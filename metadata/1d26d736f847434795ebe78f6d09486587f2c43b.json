Lead singer and principal songwriter Ed Kowalczyk left the band in November 2009.\n\nLive achieved worldwide success with their 1994 album, Throwing Copper, which has sold eight million copies in the US.[1] The band had a string of hit singles in the mid 1990s including &quot;Lightning Crashes&quot;, which stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 10 consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995.[2] The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.[3] Their last three studio albums fared only moderately well in the US, but they continued to enjoy success in The Netherlands, South Africa and Australasia.\n\nWhen touring, Live have used additional musicians, most notably Ed's younger brother Adam Kowalczyk on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. British keyboard player Michael &quot;Railo&quot; Railton and guitarist Christopher Thorn of the band Blind Melon have also toured with Live.\n\nOn November 30, 2009 Chad Taylor revealed that what had initially been termed a &quot;two-year hiatus&quot; was more likely the end of the band, due to what he felt were inappropriate and possibly illegal actions by Ed Kowalczyk,[4] which have resulted in a lawsuit being filed against him by the other three band members.[5] In June 2011, Taylor revealed that he, Gracey and Dahlheimer were to reform Live without Kowalczyk,[6] who confirmed that he would not work with the other three again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour Songs 1991\n\n\nFour Songs is an EP by Live, released in 1991.\n\nTwo songs from this EP, &quot;Operation Spirit&quot; and &quot;Good Pain&quot; later appeared on their album Mental Jewelry. The two other songs would later appear as b-sides to the European CD single for &quot;Operation Spirit&quot;.\n\nIn 1994, Live released their second album under the name Live, Throwing Copper. Both Europe and Australia released 2CD set editions of the album with Four Songs as the second disc. The Australian issue of the EP, as part of this set, was labeled as a promotional copy although released in that country in 1991 as a stand alone EP.\n\nThe EP was also released on 12-inch, green-colored vinyl.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Operation Spirit&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Good Pain&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Heaven Wore a Shirt&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Negation&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Jewelry 1991\n\n\nMental Jewelry is the first album by the band Live, released on December 31, 1991.

Guitarist Chad Taylor said, &quot;The goal was to prepare songs for the next studio session. MCA got a hold of the material and pushed us to call it an album.&quot; The songs were originally going to be released free to fans as a collection called Ecstatic Fanatic.[2] V only reached number 22 on the album chart in the US and failed to attain Gold status, despite reasonably positive reviews.\n\n&quot;Deep Enough&quot; was intended to be the album's first single until the record company overruled the band and released &quot;Simple Creed&quot; instead\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Intro&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:37\n2.\t&quot;Simple Creed&quot; (Kowalczyk, Tricky) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n3.\t&quot;Deep Enough&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n4.\t&quot;Like a Soldier&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n5.\t&quot;People Like You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n6.\t&quot;Transmit Your Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n7.\t&quot;Forever May Not Be Long Enough&quot; (Kowalczyk, Glen Ballard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n8.\t&quot;Call Me a Fool&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n9.\t&quot;Flow - 3:30\n10.\t&quot;The Ride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n11.\t&quot;Nobody Knows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n12.\t&quot;OK?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n13.\t&quot;Overcome&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n14.\t&quot;Hero of Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirds Of Pray 2003\n\n\nBirds of Pray is Live's sixth album, released in 2003.

Guitarist Chad Taylor revealed that tensions between Kowalczyk and the other three members, which would eventually cause the band to split, were already surfacing. He said that he, &quot;WasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sure how our rocker fanbase would feel about the lyrics.&quot; He expressed his frustration with the album by adding, &quot;Jim Wirt (producer) worked really hard to fashion a contemporary album, but it never felt like the Live I loved. \n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n2.\t&quot;She&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40\n3.\t&quot;The Sanctity of Dreams&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n4.\t&quot;Run Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n5.\t&quot;Life Marches On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n6.\t&quot;Like I Do&quot; (Kowalczyk, Patrick Dahlheimer, Chad Taylor) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n7.\t&quot;Sweet Release&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n8.\t&quot;Everytime I See Your Face&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n9.\t&quot;Lighthouse&quot; (Kowalczyk, Taylor) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n10.\t&quot;River Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n11.\t&quot;Out to Dry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n12.\t&quot;Bring the People Together&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n13.\t&quot;What Are We Fighting For?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs From Black Mountain 2006\n\n\nSongs from Black Mountain is Live's seventh studio album, which was released in most countries on April 10, 2006. It was released on May 9 in Canada, May 29 in the UK and June 6 in the US. It was their only release through Epic Records.[3] The first single, &quot;The River&quot;, was released on March 21, 2006.\n\nAlthough the album had some international success, including reaching number 1 in The Netherlands, it had the lowest U.S. sales of any of Live's studio albums since their first album, Mental Jewelry, peaking at number 52 on the Billboard 200.\n\nLive signed with Epic Records in 2005, having left Radioactive after the release of their 2003 album, Birds of Pray.[3] Singer Ed Kowalczyk explained that Songs from Black Mountain is in the same vein as Birds of Pray, &quot;The album itself kind of took its lead from where we were with Birds of Pray, which was just a really basic, stripped [approach]...It's just amazing. It's just a great album and the excitement level of [Epic] and the band, everybody is just really pretty blown away by it.&quot; \n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n2.\t&quot;Mystery&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n3.\t&quot;Get Ready&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n4.\t&quot;Show&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n5.\t&quot;Wings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n6.\t&quot;Sofia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n7.\t&quot;Love Shines (A Song for My Daughters About God)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n8.\t&quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n9.\t&quot;Home&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n10.\t&quot;All I Need&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n11.\t&quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n12.\t&quot;Night of Nights&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive At The Paradiso - Amsterdam 2008\n\n\n\nLive at the Paradiso ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Amsterdam is Live's first live concert album and DVD.\n\nThe DVD and CD were recorded over two nights at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. Two studio recordings, &quot;Forever&quot; and &quot;Purifier&quot; are included on the album. Singer Ed Kowalczyk said of them, &quot;Both songs kind of have this urgency about them, where we almost missed our deadlines. You can feel the urgency and the energy of the session in the songs&quot;.[1]\n\nDespite the fact that the band were about to break up, guitarist Chad Taylor was pleased with the DVD, he wrote, &quot;When I saw the magic that was on camera, I was overcome by emotion. We had documented the energy and efforts of a 20-year career together.&quot; The tensions between Ed Kowalczyk and the other three band members were revealed when he added, &quot;When the album artwork showed up with Chad, Patrick and I in black and white and Ed in color it shot pain through my veins.&quot;[2]\n\nTaylor also revealed that Kowalczyk was unhappy with his playing during the tour which included the Paradiso concerts, &quot;For some reason on that tour Ed would complain about the tuning of my guitar each and every night in the dressing room following the show. He would call Patrick at all hours of the night asking if we sounded okay. I had long talks with the techs. I begged someone to give me anything tangible that I could work on or fix. The board tapes sounded fine but the constant complaining was driving me mad. It was sucking the life out of me on stage.&quot; \n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Simple Creed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n2.\t&quot;All Over You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n3.\t&quot;The River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n4.\t&quot;The Dolphin's Cry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n5.\t&quot;I Walk the Line&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n6.\t&quot;Selling the Drama&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n7.\t&quot;Lightning Crashes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n8.\t&quot;Turn My Head&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n9.\t&quot;I Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:14\n10.\t&quot;Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n11.\t&quot;Lakini's Juice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:00\n12.\t&quot;Overcome&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n13.\t&quot;Operation Spirit&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n14.\t&quot;Dance with You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:34\n15.\t&quot;Forever&quot;* ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n16.\t&quot;Purifier&quot;* ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Live :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d26d736f847434795ebe78f6d09486587f2c43b","amp;dn":"Live+-+Studio+Discography+1991+-+2008+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d26d736f847434795ebe78f6d09486587f2c43b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,38,215,54,248,71,67,71,149,235,231,143,109,9,72,101,135,242,196,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
