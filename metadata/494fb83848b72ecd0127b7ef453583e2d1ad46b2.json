Like Taylor's earlier A&amp;M albums with Desmond, Wes Montgomery and others, BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER is a complex blend of cool jazz, easy listening, and pop, featuring lush orchestrations behind Desmond's alto sax and Herbie Hancock's electric piano.  Taken entirely from the Paul Simon songbook, the 10 cuts range from a hymn-like reading of the title track to a spunky Latin-jazz take on &quot;Cecilia.&quot;  The 2008 Verve reissue features no bonus tracks, but has excellent remastered sound.\n\nPersonnel:\nSaxophone [Alto] - Paul Desmond\nPiano [Electric] - Herbie Hancock\nGuitar - Gene Bertomcinni , Sam Brown (2)\nBass [Fender] - Jerry Jemmott\nBass [String] - Ron Carter\nDrums - Airto Moreira , Bill Lavorgna , Joao Palma \n\nPaul Desmond - Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970) Tracks:\n01 El Condor Pasa (3:03)\n02 So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright (3:30)\n03 The 59th St. Bridge Song (FeelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Groovy) (5:10)\n04 Mrs. Robinson (2:42)\n05 Old Friends (4:25)\n06 America (4:56)\n07 For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her (4:00)\n08 Scarborough Fair / Canticle (4:22)\n09 Cecilia (2:12)\n10 Bridge Over Troubled Water (3:25)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:494fb83848b72ecd0127b7ef453583e2d1ad46b2","amp;dn":"Paul+Desmond+-+Bridge+Over+Troubled+Water+%281970%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"494fb83848b72ecd0127b7ef453583e2d1ad46b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,79,184,56,72,183,46,205,1,39,183,239,69,53,131,226,209,173,70,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
