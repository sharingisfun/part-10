They hunt \ndown possible interviewees, sometimes using detectives, and \nask direct, probing questions, which prompt revealing, and \nbrutally honest (we hope) responses. \nNominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Non-Fiction Series \nfor four consecutive years, BTM has established a rigid \nformula. We explore humble beginnings, meteoric rises, \nmajor setbacks, personal struggles, crippling vices, \ndevasting falls, and climaxes that include revivals, deaths, \nand career changes.Unfortunately (for us), success \nhas crept in. As BTM became VH1's top-rated show, \nit also has become a vehicle for commercialism. In 2000, \nthe market was flooded with BTM books, CD's, and videos, \nand the recording industry started to realise the direct \ninfluence the show has on music sales. Vanilla Ice reportedly \nsold four times more albums after his episode aired, and many \nback catalogue sales have increased. So the later episodes have \nveered away from the 'classic' artists, and feature trendy, marketable newer acts. \nHence, there sometimes is precious little drama to the artists' \nstories, and the series has turned rather uneven. Still, there \nis an occasional worthy tale, though VH1 produces only three or \nfour new episodes per season these days. It's sister show, &quot;VH1's Storytellers&quot;, \nhas been revived in 2006, so there is much interest in continuing production, \nbut VH1 is being extremely tight-lipped about the subject. \n\n----------------------------------------------- \nCast &amp; Characters | Writers, Directors &amp; Crew \nStars \nadd Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Jim Forbes \nRole: Narrator \n\n\nAdd Recurring Roles to Behind The Music Bob Marley. \n\nGuest Stars \nadd Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Keith Richards \nRole: Himself \n\nCedella Marley \nRole: Herself \n\nTony Platt \nRole: Himself \n\nNeville Garrick \nRole: Himself \n\nSharon Marley \nRole: Herself \n\nCindy Breakspeare \nRole: Herself \n\nLenny Kravitz \nRole: Himself \n\nDiane Jobson \nRole: Herself \n\nRoger Steffens \nRole: Himself \n\nJoe Higgs \nRole: Himself \n\nCedella Booker \nRole: Herself \n\nZiggy Marley \nRole: Himself \n\nRita Marley \nRole: Herself \n\nMarcia Griffiths \nRole: Herself \n\nJudy Mowatt \nRole: Herself \n\nBunny Wailer \nRole: Himself \n\nChris Salewicz \nRole: Himself \n\nClement &quot;Coxson&quot; Dodd \nRole: Himself \n\n--------------------\nSeeded &amp; Issued  To Marley &amp; Tosh Torrent's\nBy Sean A.k.a Soul Rebel:22/02/2010\n\nplease keep on seed for atleast 12 - 24 hour's\n\nEnjoy !\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df065dd8192102eb1cc3e92aad0f92fd722afca0","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+-+Behind+the+Music-VH1+Documentary++Dvd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df065dd8192102eb1cc3e92aad0f92fd722afca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,6,93,216,25,33,2,235,28,195,233,42,173,15,146,253,114,42,252,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
