Designed as a return to their rock &amp; roll roots after several years of vague dance experiments, Dirty Work is hampered by uneven songs and undistinguished performances, as well as a slick, lightly synthesized production that instantly dates the album to the mid-'80s. Jagger often sounds like he's saving his best work for his solo records, but a handful of songs have a spry, vigorous attack -- &quot;One Hit (To the Body)&quot; is a classic, and &quot;Winning Ugly&quot; and &quot;Had It With You&quot; have a similar aggression. Still, most of Dirty Work sounds as forced as the cover of Bob &amp; Earl's uptown soul obscurity &quot;Harlem Shuffle,&quot; leaving the album as one of the group's most undistinguished efforts.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844982b6ac7faa14a6ec6d7d6d5bcac9f6ef9973","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Dirty+Work+%282014%29+Universal+Music+Japan+UIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844982b6ac7faa14a6ec6d7d6d5bcac9f6ef9973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,73,130,182,172,127,170,20,166,236,109,125,109,91,202,201,246,239,153,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
