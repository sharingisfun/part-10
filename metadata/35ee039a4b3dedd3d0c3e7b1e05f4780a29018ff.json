Scott's songwriting isn't always fully formed, yet his music is rich and welcoming, featuring layers of guitars, banjos, dobros, trumpets, accordions and sighing steel guitars. Occasionally, it loses itself in the mist, but Aloha from Nashville is a fascinating and often compelling listen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35ee039a4b3dedd3d0c3e7b1e05f4780a29018ff","amp;dn":"Darrell+Scott+-+Aloha+From+Nashville+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35ee039a4b3dedd3d0c3e7b1e05f4780a29018ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,238,3,154,75,61,237,211,208,195,231,177,224,95,71,128,162,144,24,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
