Although Metro 2034 is the official continuation of the Metro 2033 storyline, the 2013 video game Metro: Last Light - the sequel to the video game adaptation of the original novel - will have little to no similarities to the novel in its plot, but some events that are mentioned in the book may appear in the game also.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d31e58e4e8dc73faa279d984ffa4d5a2fbfc12","amp;dn":"Metro+2034+%28Last+Light%29+by+Dmitry+Glukhovsky+%5BENGLISH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d31e58e4e8dc73faa279d984ffa4d5a2fbfc12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,211,30,88,228,232,220,115,250,162,121,217,132,255,164,213,162,251,252,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
