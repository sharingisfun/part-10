It was the final album recorded featuring Lou Reed, who had left the band shortly before its release. In 2003, Loaded was #109 on Rolling Stone's reissue of their 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nRhino Records released Fully Loaded, a two-CD reissue of Loaded, on February 18, 1997. It contains numerous alternate takes, alternate mixes, and demo versions of Loaded songs and outtakes. Two of these include performances by Maureen Tucker (&quot;I'm Sticking with You&quot; demo, vocals; &quot;I Found a Reason&quot; demo, drums) and there is also a cameo appearance by original band member John Cale (&quot;Ocean&quot; demo, organ). Music journalist David Fricke contributed extensive liner notes to Fully Loaded.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:45\n    &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; (full-length version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:06\n    &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (full-length version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:43\n    &quot;Cool It Down&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:04\n    &quot;New Age&quot; (long version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n    &quot;Head Held High&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56\n    &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n    &quot;I Found a Reason&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;Train Round the Bend&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:21\n    &quot;Oh!
