Renoir, working amidst the rise of Hitler and the Popular front in France, had need to take license with the dark nature of Gorky\\&amp;#039;s source material, softening its bleak outlook. Kurosawa, firmly situated in the postwar world, found little reason for hope. He remained faithful to the original with its focus on the conflict between illusion and reality?a theme he would return to over and over again. Working with their most celebrated actors (Gabin with Renoir; Mifune with Kurosawa), each film offers a unique look at cinematic adaptation?where social conditions and filmmaking styles converge to create unique masterpieces.\n\nKurosawa\\&amp;#039; s Lower Depths:\nIn a slum flophouse, a collection of beggars and thieves bewail their lot in life, and Osugi, the landlady, fights with her sister, Okayo, over the man they both desire, the thief Sutekichi\nUser Rating: 7.4/10 (685 votes) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0050330/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0050330/&lt;/a&gt;\nJapanese audio English subs\n\nRenoir\\&amp;#039;s Lower Depths:\nWatch this movie if only to see the soul of Jean Gabin as it plays across his face. Louis Jouvet as the Baron is a marvel of understatement, of course. Beautifully filmed, the world of black and white film is a pleasure, in this movie, to watch. The scenes and the plot remind us of life not so long ago, a life that was harsh and brutal and filled with class divisions, you were wealthy or you were wretched. It made me want to read the original play by Maxim Gorky. Apparently Yvgeny Zamyatin, a long forgotten but brilliant Russian writer, contributed to the screenplay as well. Jean Gabin is a great actor, few people recognize his marvelous talents.\nUser Rating: 7.6/10 (376 votes) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0027336/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0027336/&lt;/a&gt;\nFrench audio English subs\n\nEnjoy and please seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c775df6598d81b18da07199d713448e4fd4772","amp;dn":"The+Lower+Depths+XviD+Kurosawa+1957+Renoir+1936+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c775df6598d81b18da07199d713448e4fd4772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,199,117,223,101,152,216,27,24,218,7,25,157,113,52,72,228,253,71,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
