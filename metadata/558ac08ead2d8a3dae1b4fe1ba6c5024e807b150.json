The world takes the form of a giant floating castle called Aincrad, with 100 floors in it. Each floor has a medieval-themed setting and a dungeon with a boss, which has to be defeated before players can advance to the next higher floor. Like most RPGs, it implements a level-based system. However, after the beta testing, the game's creator activated a system to trap the players inside the game, unable to log out; if players die in-game, or the helmets they used are removed, a strong electromagnetic pulse is emitted to kill their real bodies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:558ac08ead2d8a3dae1b4fe1ba6c5024e807b150","amp;dn":"Sword+Art+Online+15+-+25+%5BEnglish+Dub%5D+%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"558ac08ead2d8a3dae1b4fe1ba6c5024e807b150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,138,192,142,173,45,138,61,174,27,79,225,186,108,80,36,232,7,177,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
