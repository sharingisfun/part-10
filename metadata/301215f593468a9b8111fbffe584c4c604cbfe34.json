The rest of the film, using NASA footage and the voices of Apollo astronauts, takes us on a voyage to the moon, from the donning of space suits to splashdown. Footage of the scientists and engineers in Houston is inter-cut with footage of blastoff, orbiting the earth, looking back at a receding earth from inside the space capsule, circling the moon, seeing its surface up close, landing, and scenes of the astronauts on the moon's surface. They bring music with them, announce football scores, test a theory of Galileo's, and reflect on the wonder of the experience.\n\n\nDirector: Al Reinert\n\nStarring: Jim Lovell, Russell Schweickart, Eugene Cernan\n\n\niMDB URL........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097372\niMDB RATING.....: 8,0/10 from 2.239 users\nSOURCE TYPE.....: Retail Blu-Ray 1080p\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 2PASS @ 14000+ Kbps\nAUDiO 1.........: English DTS-HD\nAUDiO 2.........: Commentary Dir Al Reinert, Apollo Commander Eugene A.
