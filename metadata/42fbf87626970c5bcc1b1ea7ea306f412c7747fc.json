It follows a group of survivors, led by police officer Rick Grimes, who travel in search of a safe and secure home. The comic goes on to explore the challenges of life in a world overrun by zombies who take a toll on the survivors, and sometimes the interpersonal conflicts present a greater danger to their continuing survival than the zombies that roam the country. Over time, the characters are changed by the constant exposure to death and some grow willing to do anything to survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42fbf87626970c5bcc1b1ea7ea306f412c7747fc","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Season+1+%26amp%3B+2+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42fbf87626970c5bcc1b1ea7ea306f412c7747fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,251,248,118,38,151,12,91,204,27,30,167,234,48,111,65,44,119,71,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
