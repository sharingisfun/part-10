Tim Heckers ambient drone is a good reference point for the way the music on R.I.P.(Darren Cunningham's) third album sounds albeit with a litle more mischieve and tad less devastation. The synthesizers squirt and spit throughout the entirity of this, abstract sounds seem to emerge unexpectedly only to dissolve or disentegrate once they've racketed up the necessary tension in the music.\n\n\n01 R.I.P  \t1:16\n02 Ascending  3:08\n03 Holy Water \t1:39\n04 Marble Plexus  \t4:42\n05 Uriel's Black Harp  2:27\n06 Jardin\t 6:07\n07 Serpent  3:56\n08 Shadow From Tartarus  5:26\n09 Tree of Knowledge  4:09\n10 Raven  5:04\n11 Glint  0:37\n12 Caves of Paradise  4:15\n13 The Lord's Graffiti  3:04\n14 N.E.W.  5:28\n15 Iwaad  5:41","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0426fe59f75fb13f0c8dc814f1a84252bd2aa0ef","amp;dn":"Actress-+%282012%29+R.I.P.++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0426fe59f75fb13f0c8dc814f1a84252bd2aa0ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,38,254,89,247,95,177,63,12,141,200,20,241,168,66,82,189,42,160,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
