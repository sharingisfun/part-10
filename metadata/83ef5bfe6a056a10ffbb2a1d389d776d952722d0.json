Typhoon\n\nWhen we last heard from Tomahawk on 2007Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Anonymous, the group had set aside some of its more eclectic tactics for an album inspired by Native American imagery and concepts that founding member Duane Denison had encountered while touring with Hank Williams III. Prior to this self-described detour, the band also parted ways with original bassist and former Melvin Kevin Rutmanis. Now, after six years, the veritable supergroup has returned with its fourth release, Oddfellows. And just to be clear, this is not a reunion. If anything, Oddfellows marks a re-launching of Tomahawk, complete with new bassist Trevor Dunn, who more than fills the vacancy left by Rutmanis.\nDenison recently described Tomahawk as Ã¢â‚¬Å“what we do when we want to rock out and just go nuts and have funÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Oddfellows is the result of the approach. Recorded at Dan AuerbachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Easy Eye Studios in Nashville with producer Collin Dupuis, Oddfellows picks up where TomahawkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2003 sophomore album Mit Gas left off. TomahawkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest effort easily traverses straight up quasi-punk rockers with brooding, haunting melodies akin to Fantomas-lite tempered by latter-day Faith No More. However, DunnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence introduces a modicum of jazz architecture to the foundation of tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rise Up Dirty WatersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and in doing so, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily evolve TomahawkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound but certainly elevates it some. All throughout Oddfellows DunnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass provides a warmth not necessarily found on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first couple of releases.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83ef5bfe6a056a10ffbb2a1d389d776d952722d0","amp;dn":"Tomahawk+-+Oddfellows+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83ef5bfe6a056a10ffbb2a1d389d776d952722d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,239,91,254,106,5,106,16,255,187,42,29,56,157,119,109,149,39,34,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
