Das' Sixth Edition of PRINCIPLES OF FOUNDATION ENGINEERING maintains the careful balance of current research and practical field applications that has made it the leading text in foundation engineering courses. Featuring a wealth of worked-out examples and figures that help students with theory and problem-solving skills, the book introduces civil engineering students to the fundamental concepts and application of foundation analysis design. Throughout, Das emphasizes the judgment needed to properly apply the theories and analysis to the evaluation of soils and foundation design as well as the need for field experience. The sixth edition contains many new homework and worked-out problems.\nAbout the Author\nDr. Braja M. Das has been the Dean of the School of Engineering and Computer Science from August 1994 to the present at California State University, Sacramento. Prior to 1994, he was the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs and Research at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Illinois. The author of more than 200 technical papers, his primary areas of research are shallow foundations, earth anchors, and geosynthetics. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 768 pages\nPublisher: CL-Engineering; 006 edition (July 26, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9780495082460\nISBN-13: 978-0495082460\nASIN: 0495082465\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e44e76502705d8acfdf1a94b7dadbe55f076733","amp;dn":"Solution+Manual+-+Principles+of+Foundation+Engineering+6th+Editi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e44e76502705d8acfdf1a94b7dadbe55f076733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,68,231,101,2,112,93,138,207,223,26,148,183,218,219,229,95,7,103,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
