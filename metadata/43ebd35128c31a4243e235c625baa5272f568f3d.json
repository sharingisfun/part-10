Plus you get the entire &quot;Squeezing Out Sparks&quot; album, usually considered to be the high point of his career. One problem with this collection, though, is an apparent error where studio versions of songs from the live &quot;Parkerilla&quot; album are included rather than the correct tracks from the live album.&quot;\n\nTracks:\n\ndisc 1\n1. Between You And Me  \n2. I'm Gonna Use It Now  \n3. You've Got To Be Kidding  \n4. Howlin' Wind  \n5. Back To Schooldays  \n6. White Honey  \n7. That's What They All Say(Live)  \n8.
