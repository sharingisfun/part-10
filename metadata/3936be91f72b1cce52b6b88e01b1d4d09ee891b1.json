Bob knows fast driving - and he knows how to teach it! Here Bob draws from his highly-regarded law enforcement course on police pursuit and counterterrorist interception driving to fill you in on the pursuit techniques used by today's police officers. Corporal Edwin Sanow illustrates several of Bondurant's techniques with firsthand accounts of actual police pursuit situations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3936be91f72b1cce52b6b88e01b1d4d09ee891b1","amp;dn":"Police+and+Pursuit+Driving.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3936be91f72b1cce52b6b88e01b1d4d09ee891b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,54,190,145,247,43,28,206,82,182,184,142,1,177,212,208,158,232,145,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
