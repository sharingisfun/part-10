The areas of application described are typical of what originally set off the nanotechnology revolution. An account of original research contributions from researchers all over the world, the book is extremely valuable for gaining an understanding of the latest developments in applied nanotechnology. Clearly structured and readable, the book is useful for both students and researchers alike: students can learn about the various aspects of nanotechnology, and professional researchers can update themselves on the new developments in this dynamic field.\r\n\r\nThe book covers nanoscale materials and devices for both electronics and optical technologies. The emphasis throughout is on experimental methods rather than theoretical modeling. The material will provide food for thought for researchers and research students keen to develop new technologies at the ultra-small scale and to open up new avenues for research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:222f03cbc329aefa2cece0aee262f85ca4bc4c30","amp;dn":"Nanostructures+in+Electronics+and+Photonics+-+Faiz+Rahman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"222f03cbc329aefa2cece0aee262f85ca4bc4c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,47,3,203,195,41,174,250,44,236,224,174,226,98,248,92,164,188,76,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
