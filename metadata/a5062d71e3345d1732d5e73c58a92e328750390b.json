Release: 2009.\n\n\nDue to litigation, George Jones's seminal Musicor recordings have been in disarray for years. In 2009, the Bear Family label began to rectify this state of affairs by bringing out Jones's total Musicor output in two deluxe box sets, complete with the excellent remastering and documentation that the German label is famous for. The 4-CD 131-track A GOOD YEAR FOR THE ROSES is the second of these collections. On it one can hear the celebrated title track as well as &quot;I'll Share My World With You,&quot; &quot;When The Grass Grows Over Me,&quot; and other classic songs, including George Jones's first duets with Tammy Wynette. He would eventually follow the singer (his future wife) to Epic Records in 1971. But many believe that the country icon did his greatest work for Musicor under his mentor Pappy Dailey's guiding hand. The results are presented here for the listener to judge.
