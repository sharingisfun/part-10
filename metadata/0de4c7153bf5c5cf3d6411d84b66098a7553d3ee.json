This book explains the emergence of counterparty risk and how financial institutions are developing capabilities for valuing it. It also covers portfolio management and hedging of credit value adjustment, debit value adjustment, and wrong-way counterparty risks. In addition, the book addresses the design and benefits of central clearing, a recent development in attempts to control the rapid growth of counterparty risk. This uniquely practical resource serves as an invaluable guide for market practitioners, policy makers, academics, and students.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAcknowledgements xvii\n\nList of Spreadsheets xix\n\nList of Appendices xxi\n\nSECTION I INTRODUCTION 1\n\n1 Introduction 3\n\n2 Background 9\n\n2.1 Introduction 9\n\n2.2 Financial risk 9\n\n2.3 Value-at-Risk 11\n\n2.4 The derivatives market 14\n\n2.5 Counterparty risk in context 18\n\n2.6 Summary 20\n\n3 Defining Counterparty Credit Risk 21\n\n3.1 Introducing counterparty credit risk 21\n\n3.2 Components and terminology 30\n\n3.3 Control and quantification 34\n\n3.4 Summary 40\n\nSECTION II MITIGATION OF COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK 41\n\n4 Netting, Compression, Resets and Termination Features 45\n\n4.1 Introduction 45\n\n4.2 Netting 46\n\n4.3 Termination features and trade compression 51\n\n4.4 Conclusion 57\n\n5 Collateral 59\n\n5.1 Introduction 59\n\n5.2 Collateral terms 64\n\n5.3 Defining the amount of collateral 71\n\n5.4 The risks of collateralisation 74\n\n5.5 Summary 77\n\n6 Default Remote Entities and the Too Big to Fail Problem 79\n\n6.1 Introduction 79\n\n6.2 Special purpose vehicles 82\n\n6.3 Derivative product companies 82\n\n6.4 Monolines and credit DPCs 84\n\n6.5 Central counterparties 93\n\n7 Central Counterparties 97\n\n7.1 Centralised clearing 97\n\n7.2 Logistics of central clearing 105\n\n7.3 Analysis of the impact and benefits of CCPs 113\n\n7.4 Conclusions 118\n\n8 Credit Exposure 121\n\n8.1 Credit exposure 121\n\n8.2 Metrics for credit exposure 126\n\n8.3 Factors driving credit exposure 130\n\n8.4 Understanding the impact of netting on exposure 138\n\n8.5 Credit exposure and collateral 143\n\n8.6 Risk-neutral or real-world? 150\n\n8.7 Summary 153\n\nSECTION III CREDIT VALUE ADJUSTMENT 155\n\n9 Quantifying Credit Exposure 157\n\n9.1 Introduction 157\n\n9.2 Methods for quantifying credit exposure 157\n\n9.3 Monte Carlo methodology 159\n\n9.4 Models for credit exposure 165\n\n9.5 Netting examples 170\n\n9.6 Allocating exposure 175\n\n9.7 Exposure and collateral 185\n\n9.8 Summary 195\n\n10 Default Probability, Credit Spreads and Credit Derivatives 197\n\n10.1 Default probability and recovery rates 197\n\n10.2 Credit default swaps 211\n\n10.3 Curve mapping 217\n\n10.4 Portfolio credit derivatives 220\n\n10.5 Summary 224\n\n11 Portfolio Counterparty Credit Risk 225\n\n11.1 Introduction 225\n\n11.2 Double default 225\n\n11.3 Credit portfolio losses 229\n\n11.4 Summary 239\n\n12 Credit Value Adjustment 241\n\n12.1 Definition of CVA 242\n\n12.2 CVA and exposure 246\n\n12.3 Impact of default probability and recovery 250\n\n12.4 Pricing new trades using CVA 252\n\n12.5 CVAwith collateral 260\n\n12.6 Summary 263\n\n13 Debt Value Adjustment 265\n\n13.1 DVA and counterparty risk 265\n\n13.2 The DVA controversy 271\n\n13.3 How to monetise DVA 274\n\n13.4 Further DVA considerations 277\n\n13.5 Summary 281\n\n14 Funding and Valuation 283\n\n14.1 Background 283\n\n14.2 OIS discounting 285\n\n14.3 Funding value adjustment 290\n\n14.4 Optimisation of CVA, DVA and funding costs 299\n\n14.5 Future trends 304\n\n14.6 Summary 306\n\n15 Wrong-Way Risk 307\n\n15.1 Introduction 307\n\n15.2 Overview of wrong-way risk 307\n\n15.3 Portfolio wrong-way risk 314\n\n15.4 Trade-level wrong-way risk 319\n\n15.5 Wrong-way risk and credit derivatives 331\n\n15.6 Summary 337\n\nSECTION IV MANAGING COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK 339\n\n16 Hedging Counterparty Risk 341\n\n16.1 Background to CVA hedging 342\n\n16.2 Components of CVA hedging 346\n\n16.3 Exposure hedges 349\n\n16.4 Credit hedges 354\n\n16.5 Cross-dependency 357\n\n16.6 The impact of DVA and collateral 362\n\n16.7 Summary 368\n\n17 Regulation and Capital Requirements 371\n\n17.1 Introduction 371\n\n17.2 Basel II 372\n\n17.3 Exposure under Basel II 375\n\n17.4 Basel III 384\n\n17.5 Central counterparties 399\n\n17.6 Summary 401\n\n18 Managing CVA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Ã¢â‚¬Å“CVA DeskÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ 403\n\n18.1 Introduction 403\n\n18.2 The role of a CVA desk 404\n\n18.3 CVA charging 410\n\n18.4 Technology 415\n\n18.5 Practical hedging of CVA 419\n\n18.6 Summary 425\n\n19 The Future of Counterparty Risk 427\n\n19.1 Key components 427\n\n19.2 Key axes of development 430\n\n19.3 The continuing challenge for global financial markets 432\n\nReferences 435\n\nIndex 443\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJon Gregory is an experienced practitioner in the area of financial risk management.
