CRM is a vast region covering parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming with key cities including Yakima, Boise, Idaho Falls, Helena, Billings, and Jackson. You will experience varied and beautiful landscapes with custom seasonal ground textures based on current aerial photograps taken over the region. Spectacular locations, such as the Columbia Plateau, Hells Canyon, Craters of the Moon National Monument, the Salmon River and Sawtooth Mountains, the Montana Prairies, and Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, all are depicted in great detail.\n\n Just like with the NA BLUE series we've given every single of the ~450 airports and airstrips in the region an upgrade with more accurate placements of runways and taxiways as well as buildings, hangars, and objects. Additionally, every single square mile of land class is hand placed and all major roads, rivers lakes, powerlines, wind farms, and vertical obstructions are included for accurate VFR flying. Last but not least all ground textures are hand-annotated with our custom autogen objects. \nContinues coverage SE from PNW and NRM\nSuperb new Matt Tomkins ground textures\nHand-placed landclass covers every sq mile\nAccurate roads, rivers, lakes, powerlines\n10m Holgermesh for high terrain detail\nSelected photoreal coverage areas\nCustom autogen textures and objects\nSuper accurate autogen annotation\nOver 450 airports have been upgraded!\nFeatures Yellowstone and Grand Teton\nThousands of animated wind turbines\nThe perfect addition to NA BLUE series!\n\nGoogle Earth Coverage Map: http://fullterrain.com/kmz/FTX_CRM_NA_GOLD_1.0.kmz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc5a4e6a3ef645743cf0c509e35d0486fee54fb2","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+-+ORBX+-+FTX+NA+GOLD+-+USA+Central+Rocky+Mountains","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc5a4e6a3ef645743cf0c509e35d0486fee54fb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,90,78,106,62,246,69,116,60,240,197,9,227,93,4,134,254,229,79,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
