English subtitles are &quot;hard-embedded&quot; on screen.\n\nThere is also an English-audio-dubbed VHS RIP available with the name &quot;Voyage to the End of the Universe&quot;. However, the video quality of that version is horrible.\n\nGoogle Chromecast supports just a limited number of video and audio codecs and container file types. Chromecast still does not handle subtitles, so the English subtitles have been overlayed directly on the video image with this download.\n\nVideo: H264 ( 720 x 404 ) --- Audio: AAC (m4a) stereo 48000\n\nThis small but quality movie file with embedded subtitles was created using VLC and Avanti.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122111/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122111/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWikipedia: In the year 2163 the starship Ikarie XB-1 (Ikarus XB-1) is sent to the mysterious &quot;White Planet&quot; orbiting the star Alpha Centauri. Travelling at near-light speed, the journey takes around 28 months for the astronauts, although the effects of relativity mean that 15 years will have elapsed on Earth by the time they reach their destination. During the flight the 40-strong multinational crew must adjust to life in space, as well as dealing with various hazards they encounter, including a derelict 20th century spaceship armed with nuclear weapons, a deadly radioactive &quot;dark star&quot; and the mental breakdown of one of the crew, who threatens to destroy the spacecraft.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e94d413a461a9a689560425f8534945fc79e7ab7","amp;dn":"Ikarie+XB+1+%281963%29+H264+English+for+Chromecast+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e94d413a461a9a689560425f8534945fc79e7ab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,77,65,58,70,26,154,104,149,96,66,95,133,52,148,95,199,158,122,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
