This is just an organized, properly labeled and split version of the only torrent I could find for Rocket Power.\n\nEpisodes vary in quality and file type: AVI, MOV, MPG, MP4.\nSeveral episodes are missing, and I have no idea where to find them. Sorry.\n\nEPISODE LIST:\nWhen aired on TV, each episode, with the exception of:\n\n.....S03E15 Reggie's Big (Beach) Break\n.....S03E16 A Rocket X-Mas\n.....S03E21 Twist of Fate\n\nwas split into two 11-minute stories. For organizational purposes, these files have been split the same way.\n\nSo in the torrent, rather than having one file for each episode, they've been split into the two separate stories. This is because some were missing the first or second story of an episode, and I had to figure out which ones those were.\n\n-----\n\nEXAMPLE:\nAn episode listed on Wikipedia like this:\nSeason 1 - Episode 1 - &quot;New Squid on the Block/Down the Drain&quot;\n\nWill instead be separated and labeled like this:\nS01E01 A - New Squid on the Block.avi\nS01E01 B - Down the Drain.avi\n\n-----\n\nIn 2002-2004, a TV special was released for each of the three seasons of Rocket Power. All three season specials are included in this torrent:\n\n.....Season 1: &quot;Race Across New Zealand&quot;\n.....Season 2: &quot;Island of the Menehune&quot;\n.....Season 3: &quot;The Big Day&quot;\n\nMISSING EPISODES:\nClick on the number next to &quot;Files&quot; at the top of this page to see the list of episodes included in the torrent.\nThe following episodes listed below are NOT in the torrent:\n\nSEASON 1:\n.....01B Down the Drain\n.....02A Secret Spot\n.....02B Ice Queens\n.....04A Happy Luau to You-Au\n.....04B Rocket Resue\n.....05A Twister's Cuz\n.....05B Big Thursday\n.....06B Father's Day Off\n.....07A Powergirl Surfers\n.....07B Twisted Cinema\n.....08A Blader Bowl\n.....13A The Night Before\n.....16A Reggie and a Net\n.....16B The Great Sandcastle Race\n.....17A It Was a Dark and Stormy Day\n.....17B Escape From Lars Mountain\n.....20B Welcome to the Club\n\nSEASON 2:\n.....03A Radical New Equipment\n.....07A Legends and Their Falls\n.....10A It Came From Planet Merv\n.....10B Netherworld Night\n.....11A Here's the Twist\n.....11B Sam: King of Kickball\n.....12A Tito Time\n.....12B The Return of Clio\n.....15A Capture the Flag\n.....15B The Jinx\n\nSEASON 3:\n.....07A Tito Sitting\n.....08A Twisting Places\n.....08B Power Play\n.....12B X-Treme Ideas\n.....13A Rad Rover Come Over\n.....13B Extreme Nerd\n.....14A Cinco de Twisto\n.....15- Reggie's Big (Beach) Break\n.....16- A Rocket X-Mas\n.....17B Reggie: The Movie\n.....18A Summer Breezy\n.....18B Sam's Fortune\n.....19A Merv Links to Otto\n.....19B Big Air\n.....21- Twist of Fate\n\n----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n\nIf you have any of the missing episodes, OR any of the included episodes in better quality, feel free to upload them - the only reason why I've uploaded a torrent in such condition is because NO ONE ELSE HAS.\nSo please, make a contribution - and if you don't have anything to add, at least seed!\nComments are welcome.
