And while \n\nthe Outlaws' 1978 release, Bring It Back Alive, is one of the decade's \n\nmost underrated live efforts (but did manage to introduce the group to \n\na whole new set of fans), their 1993 in-concert offering, Hittin' the \n\nRoad, is surprisingly not too shabby in its own right. The playing \n\nremains inspired throughout (as does the energy level) -- which can \n\noften prove problematic at times with live releases by certain veteran \n\nrockers, who seem appear to stay set on cruise control. But the \n\nOutlaws dodge the &quot;blah bullet&quot; throughout, especially on the album-\n\nopening title track, &quot;(Ghost) Riders in the Sky,&quot; and the set-closing \n\njamfest, &quot;Green Grass &amp; High Tides.&quot; While most fans will deem Bring \n\nIt Back Alive to be the Outlaws' definitive concert statement, \n\n'Hittin' the Road' proved that there was still plenty left in the tank \n\nfrom these old codgers.\n\n\n1.
