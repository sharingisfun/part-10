He is assisted by the android Mia, who provides advice and navigation, helping Conrad find the keys, consoles and power supplies he needs to escape each level and ultimately discover a way to save the Leopold.\n\nAt the end of the fourth level, Conrad must cross over from the Leopold to the Ghost Ship. While there, he encounters the Moss creature, the final boss.\n\nIn the Co-Op Assault multiplayer levels, two men, Barnes and Vance, are trying to locate Conrad by storming through sections of the Leopold.
