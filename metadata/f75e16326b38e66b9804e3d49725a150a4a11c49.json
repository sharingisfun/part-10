Freed from the rigorous constraints of designing for real users, sci-fi production designers develop blue-sky interfaces that are inspiring, humorous, and even instructive. By carefully studying these Ã¢â‚¬Å“outsiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ user interfaces, designers can derive lessons that make their real-world designs more cutting edge and successful.\n\nMake It So shows:\n- Sci-fi interfaces have been there (almost) from the beginning\n- Sci-fi creates a shared design language that sets audience expectations\n- If an interface works for an audience, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something there that will work for users\n- Bad sci-fi interfaces can sometimes be the most inspiring\n- There are ten Ã¢â‚¬Å“meta-lessonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ spread across hundreds of examples\n- You can useÃ¢â‚¬â€and not just enjoyÃ¢â‚¬â€sci-fi in your design work\n- Over 150 lessons and 10 Ã¢â‚¬Å“metaÃ¢â‚¬Å“ lessons that developers can use to enhance their realworld interfaces\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
