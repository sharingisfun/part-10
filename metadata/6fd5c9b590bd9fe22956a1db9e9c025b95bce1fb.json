With his debut album, Brown Sugar, the 21-year-old D'Angelo crashed down some of those barriers. D'Angelo concentrates on classic versions of soul and R&amp;B, but unlike most of his contemporaries, he doesn't cut and paste older songs with hip-hop beats; instead, he attacks the forms with a hip-hop attitude, breathing new life into traditional forms. Not all of his music works -- there are several songs that sound incomplete, relying more on sound than structure. But when he does have a good song -- like the hit &quot;Brown Sugar,&quot; Smokey Robinson's &quot;Cruisin',&quot; or the bluesy &quot;Shit, Damn, Motherfucker,&quot; among several others -- D'Angelo's wild talents are evident. Brown Sugar might not be consistently brilliant, but it is one of the most exciting debuts of 1995, giving a good sense of how deep D'Angelo's talents run. \n\nLink:\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:ak5gtq6znu46\n\n01 - Brown Sugar\n02 - Alright\n03 - Jonz In My Bonz\n04 - Me And Those Dreamin' Eyes Of Mine\n05 - Shit, Damn, Motherfucker\n06 - Smooth\n07 - Cruisin'\n08 - When We Get By\n09 - Lady\n10 - Higher\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd5c9b590bd9fe22956a1db9e9c025b95bce1fb","amp;dn":"D%5C%27Angelo+-+Brown+Sugar+%5B1995%5D+%28EAC+%2B+LAME+APS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd5c9b590bd9fe22956a1db9e9c025b95bce1fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,213,201,181,144,189,159,226,41,86,161,219,158,156,2,91,149,188,225,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
