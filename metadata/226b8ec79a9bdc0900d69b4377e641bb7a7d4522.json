Formed in 1969, the group consists of Billy Gibbons (guitar and vocals), Dusty Hill (bass and vocals), and Frank Beard (percussion). ZZ Top's early sound was rooted in blues but eventually grew to exhibit contemporary influences. Throughout their career they have maintained a sound based on Hill's and Beard's rhythm section support, accentuated by Gibbons' guitar and vocal style. Their lyrics often gave evidence of band's humor and thematically focus on personal experiences and sexual innuendos.\n\n\nThis Album Is ZZ Top Live In Texas [2008]\n\n\nto check out the the quality the album.. visit this page\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=116496&amp;pid=767459#pid767459&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=116496&amp;pid=767459#pid767459&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand to check the files in the album.. click on the files no. in the torrent details\n\n\nplease seed after downloading\n\ncheck out my other uploads as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226b8ec79a9bdc0900d69b4377e641bb7a7d4522","amp;dn":"zz+top+-+live+in+texas+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226b8ec79a9bdc0900d69b4377e641bb7a7d4522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,107,142,199,154,155,220,9,0,214,155,67,119,230,65,187,122,125,69,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
