It is also intended as an introduction to - and an invitation to indulge in - a way of thinking about issues which are central to the heritage field itself and, indeed, to the interpretation of our pasts. In concentrating upon themes and issues, the book is expressly theoretical in tone: it is not intended as a guide for practitioners on how to 'do' heritage nor does it recommend particular ways of managing the heritage.\nThe book is aimed particularly at students of archaeology, history or museum and heritage studies at undergraduate and postgraduate level. It may prove of use to part-time and continuing education students and to those following more advanced studies who find a need to engage with heritage issues. Although designed as a work-text for students, it will also hopefully provide a useful introduction for the more general reader with an interest in archaeology and the material heritage.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface: The Aims of This Book\nAcknowledgements\nIntroductory Interlude: A Note about Literature\nand Discourses of Heritage and Archaeology\n1 Heritage All Around Us\n2 Components of the Heritage and Their Treatment\n3 Institutions of Heritage\n4 'Public' Archaeologies 1: Defining the Public\n5 'Public' Archaeologies 2: Engaging with the Public\n6 The Value 'Debate' in Archaeology\n7 Relocating Heritage in Archaeology\nReferences\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6f23a7485f2ccac50bfdfb23959a53acd3712c","amp;dn":"Archaeology+and+Heritage+-+An+Introduction+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6f23a7485f2ccac50bfdfb23959a53acd3712c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,111,35,167,72,95,44,202,197,11,253,251,35,149,154,83,172,211,113,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
