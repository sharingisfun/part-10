Since emerging from the late-90s, Evans has become one of Country music's most popular female vocalists, acquiring a few No. 1 Country hits and Gold and Platinum-certified albums by the RIAA, like 2004's Restless and 2005's Real Fine Place. Her 2000 album, Born to Fly was certified Double-Platinum.\n\n\nGreatest Hits is a 2007 compilation album from American country music singer Sara Evans. It features ten of her greatest hits from her second through fifth albums, as well as four newly recorded tracks.\n\nGreatest Hits chronicles the highest-peaking singles from Evans' second through fifth studio albums: 1998's No Place That Far, 2000's Born to Fly, 2003's Restless, and 2005's Real Fine Place. All of the selections from these albums reached Top 20 or higher on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. (No tracks are included from her 1997 debut album Three Chords and the Truth, which did not produce any Top 40 country hits.) Among the previously released tracks are her four Number One hits: 1999's &quot;No Place That Far&quot;, 2000's &quot;Born to Fly&quot;, 2004's &quot;Suds in the Bucket&quot;, and 2005's &quot;A Real Fine Place to Start&quot;.\n\nIn addition to the previously released tracks, Greatest Hits includes four previously unreleased tracks: &quot;As If&quot;, &quot;Love You with All My Heart&quot;, &quot;Pray for You&quot;, and &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot;. In mid-2007, &quot;As If&quot; was released as the first single from this album, reaching a peak of #11 on the country charts. &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot;, a celebration of home, family and such simple pleasures as seeing the kids get off the bus at the end of the school day, was released in early 2008 as the second single. The song's hook &quot;some things never change&quot; is based on the central character's realization that, while things may change in the world around her, the basics of love between family will never change. It reached #26 on the country charts. &quot;Love You with All My Heart,&quot; the album's third single, failed to land on the chart after its release on June 23, 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d557fe3bf0162a89af1d4b8865b38782ef969f06","amp;dn":"Sara+Evans+Greatest+Hits+%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blazer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d557fe3bf0162a89af1d4b8865b38782ef969f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,87,254,59,240,22,42,137,175,29,75,136,101,179,135,130,239,150,159,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
