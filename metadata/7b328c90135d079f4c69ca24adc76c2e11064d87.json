He was recorded by Alan Lomax there for the Library of Congress in 1941. In 1943, he headed to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician, eventually recording, in 1946, for first Columbia and then Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists:...............-Muddy Waters\r\nAlbum Name:............-The Chess Singles Collection\r\nFormat:................-Mp3,\r\nBitrate:...............-320\r\nGenre:.................-Blues\r\nSize:..................-542 MB\r\nTracks:................-CD 1 (25) , CD 2 (26) , CD 3 (28)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CD 1\r\n1.
