The parts \nmove progressively along a time line from the emergence of \nearly humans to the present day. Each part emphasizes a \nsingle theme-for example, urbanization or religion or trade \n-and students learn to use all eight themes to analyze his- \ntorical events and to develop a grasp of the chronology of \nhuman development. Geographically, each part cover the \nentire globe, although specific topics place greater emphasis \non specific regions. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3664f70cbf52535c8ecd88878c6d66a4722f291","amp;dn":"The+World%27s+History+3rd+Edition+%28combined+volume%29+%2F+Howard+Spode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3664f70cbf52535c8ecd88878c6d66a4722f291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,102,79,112,203,245,37,53,200,236,216,136,120,198,214,106,71,34,242,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
