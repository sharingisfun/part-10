So when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hired by an anguished father to rescue his kid from an evil tech conglomerate, it seems like the perfect job to use for ethics practice. \n\nThen she finds her clientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter . . . who is a robot. \n\nThe researchers who own the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢bot will stop at nothing to get it back, but the kidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just real enough for Cas to want to protect her Ã¢â‚¬â€ even though she knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s risking everything for a collection of metal and wires. But when the case blows up in her face, it plunges Cas into the crossfire of a massive, decades-long corporate espionage war. \n\nCas knows logically that she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t saving a child. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stealing a piece of technology, one expensive and high-stakes enough that spiriting it away is going to get innocent people killed. But she has a distraught father on one hand and a robot programmed to act like a distraught daughter on the other, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been able to sit by when a kid is in trouble Ã¢â‚¬â€ even a fake one. \n\nScrew morals and ethics. All Cas wants to do is save one little girl.\n\nFor more information see www.slhuang.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ccd036c1b571da07324b114a9d6d898cc9ffa1","amp;dn":"Half+Life%2C+by+SL+Huang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ccd036c1b571da07324b114a9d6d898cc9ffa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,204,208,54,193,181,113,218,7,50,75,17,74,157,109,137,140,201,255,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
