Back in 1965, the BBC commissioned a Doctor Who movie starring Peter Cushing. Okay, the movie was terribly done. It even lacked the defining Doctor musical theme, but one cannot consider the collection complete without it.\n\nEnjoy and pass it around to the rest of the Whovian community.\n\nBNaron\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b893bfb5a79eaf597c619f981178dcb25059adeb","amp;dn":"%281965%29+-+Dr+Who+and+the+Daleks+%28Peter+Cushing%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b893bfb5a79eaf597c619f981178dcb25059adeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,147,191,181,167,158,175,89,124,97,159,152,17,120,220,178,80,89,173,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
