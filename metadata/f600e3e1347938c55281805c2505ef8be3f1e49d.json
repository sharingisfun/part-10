It just takes practice! Exercise your drawing skills and become better at seeing and capturing the world around you with Von Glitschka's 5-day drawing challenges. This installment asks you to reconsider the fascinating subjects Mother Nature provides and reinterpret them using your own imagination and a pen, pencil, or stylus.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Von will assign a drawing challenge for each day. Take the time you need to finish each challenge, and then watch the video where Von shares his own hand-drawn solution. There are no right answers here; his solutions should serve as inspiration.
