Jagger gained much press notoriety for admitted drug use and romantic involvements, and was often portrayed as a counterculture figure. In the late 1960s Jagger began acting in films (starting with Performance and Ned Kelly), to mixed reception. In 1985, Jagger released his first solo album, She's the Boss, and was knighted in 2003. In early 2009, he joined the eclectic supergroup SuperHeavy.\n\nJagger's career has spanned over fifty years. His performance style has been said to have &quot;opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now an integral part of contemporary youth culture&quot;.[1] Allmusic has described Jagger as &quot;one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock &amp; roll&quot;.[2] His distinctive voice and performance, along with Keith Richards' guitar style, have been the trademark of The Rolling Stones throughout the career of the band.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Very Best Of Mick Jagger 2007\n\n\nThe Very Best of Mick Jagger is a compilation album that was released worldwide on 1 October 2007 and the following day in the United States on WEA/Rhino Records. This 17-track release is the first ever overview of Mick Jagger's solo career.[3]\n\nThe collection includes singles, album tracks, and collaborations with John Lennon, David Bowie, Bono, Lenny Kravitz, Peter Tosh, Ry Cooder, David A. Stewart and Jeff Beck among others. It includes three previously-unreleased songs:\n\n- &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot;, produced by John Lennon and recorded by Jagger in 1973 in Los Angeles. The track features guitarists Danny Kortchmar and Jesse Ed Davis, keyboardist Al Kooper, bassist Jack Bruce, drummer Jim Keltner and, on backing vocals, singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson. Neither Lennon nor Bill Wyman, who was present at the session, appear on the track.\n\n- &quot;Checking Up on My Baby&quot;, recorded in 1992 with L.A. blues band, The Red Devils.\n\n- &quot;Charmed Life&quot;, recorded while Jagger was working on Wandering Spirit with producer Rick Rubin. Jagger had sketched it out (with his daughter Karis Jagger on backing vocals), but then decided the track didn't fit with the rest of the album. The version on Very Best is remixed by producer Ashley Beadle. The song was also released as a promo single with various remixes, and reached the Top 20 on Billboard's Hot Dance Singles chart in early 2008.\n\nA special edition with DVD was also released with more than 72 minutes of content, including an extensive interview with Mick Jagger from early/mid 2007, nine videos, and extras.\n\nJagger has promoted the album through interviews including a special for Rolling Stone,[4] a comprehensive Q&amp;A with fans on the BBC web site [5] and TV appearances. He also re-launched his web site [6] with audio, video, photos and more information about this compilation and his solo work in general.\n\nThe album debuted in the British chart at #57 with sales of nearly 4,000 copies and in the American chart at #77 selling 11,846 copies during the first week.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;God Gave Me Everything&quot; (Mick Jagger, Lenny Kravitz) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32 (2001)\n2.\t&quot;Put Me in the Trash&quot; (Jagger, Jimmy Rip) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 (1993)\n3.\t&quot;Just Another Night&quot; (Jagger) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15 (1985)\n4.\t&quot;Don't Tear Me Up&quot; (Jagger) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12 (1993)\n5.\t&quot;Charmed Life&quot; (Jagger) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 (1992 &amp; 2007)\n6.\t&quot;Sweet Thing&quot; (Jagger) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 (1993)\n7.\t&quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot; (Jagger, David A.
