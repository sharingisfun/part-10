Wrong on both counts. This double CD documents his Blue Star recordings of 1947 and 1953 and Reinhardt (on electric guitar) takes inventive boppish solos that put him at the top of the list of jazz guitarists who were active during the era. Most of the earlier tracks feature Reinhardt in the Quintet of the Hot Club of France with clarinetist Hubert Rostaing but the eight later selections in which he is backed by a standard rhythm section are most interesting. These well-recorded performances hint at what Django Reinhardt might have accomplished in the 1950s had he lived longer. Highly recommended.\n\nTracklist\n\n1-1 PÃƒÂªche ÃƒÂ  La Mouche 2:34\n1-2 Minor Blues 2:46\n1-3 For Sentimental Reasons 2:57\n1-4 Danse Norvegienne 3:01\n1-5 Blues For Barclay 2:52\n1-6 Folie A Amphion 2:52\n1-7 Vette 3:12\n1-8 Anniversary Song 3:34\n1-9 Swing 48 2:44\n1-10 September Song 3:17\n1-11 Brazil 2:46\n1-12 I'll Never Smile Again 2:40\n1-13 New York City 2:36\n1-14 Django's Blues 3:05\n1-15 Love's Mood 3:06\n1-16 I Love You 2:52\n\n2-1 Topsy 3:04\n2-2 Moppin The Bride (Micro) 2:20\n2-3 Insensiblement 3:12\n2-4 Mano 2:53\n2-5 Blues Primitif 2:41\n2-6 Gipsy With A Song (Take 1) 3:00\n2-7 Gipsy With A Song (Take 2) 2:57\n2-8 Night And Day 2:53\n2-9 Confessin' (That I Love You) 2:56\n2-10 Blues For Ike 3:22\n2-11 September Song 2:34\n2-12 Night And Day 2:50\n2-13 Insensiblement 3:06\n2-14 Manoir De Mes Reves 2:36\n2-15 Nuages 3:16\n2-16 Brazil 2:26\n2-17 Confessin' That I Love You 3:38\n\nP.D. : Django was also an excellent fisherman, Peche a la mouche means fly-fishing ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9b153ea06352393a40ae1e8a957df6b4b6a4fc","amp;dn":"Django+Reinhardt+-+Peche+a+la+mouche+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9b153ea06352393a40ae1e8a957df6b4b6a4fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,155,21,62,160,99,82,57,58,64,174,30,138,149,125,246,180,182,164,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
