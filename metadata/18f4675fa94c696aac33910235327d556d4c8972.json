Some believe he is the \r\ngreatest scientific mind around, while others see him as a lunatic. His \r\nlatest project, an atomic submarine, the Seaview, which he designed and built, \r\nis evoking as many divergent views. The Seaview is going through its final \r\ntests in the Arctic region. One day, the Seaview unexpectedly goes through a \r\ndangerous underwater ice shower - the ice pieces the size of large boulders \r\n- which Nelson and his crew ultimately learn is due to the Van Allen Radiation \r\nBelt being on fire, causing the break-up of icebergs on the surface. If the \r\nfire is not contained, it could mean the destruction of the Earth. At a UN \r\nmeeting in New York to discuss what to do, Nelson states that he believes the \r\nfire will not burn out as many other scientists believe, and that he can \r\nextinguish the fire by shooting a missile at the belt in exactly sixteen days \r\nfrom the region of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific. His view is supported \r\nby his friend, fellow scientist, retired Commodore Lucius Emory. Unable to \r\nget orders for or against from the US government, Nelson proceeds to sail \r\nthe Seaview to his intended destination, which is against the wishes of the \r\nUN. Despite being generally loyal to the admiral, many aboard the Seaview \r\nbelieve his action is irrational, foolish and/or reckless. Among those are: \r\nCaptain Lee Crane, the sub's commanding officer; Dr. Susan Hiller, a \r\nvisiting psychiatrist on board to do research of the effects of stress on \r\nthe crew; and Miguel Alvarez, a civilian scientist and religious zealot, \r\nwho believes that if the world is to end that it is God's fate. Caught in \r\nthe middle is Lieutenant Cathy Connors, the admiral's secretary, who is \r\nstill seemingly loyal to her boss, but who is also engaged to Captain Crane. \r\nThese internal struggles are not the only obstacles Nelson faces, but also \r\nthe regular perils of the ocean, the UN who they learn has issued a seek and \r\ndestroy order of the Seaview, and a potentially mutinous crew, one of who \r\nseems to be sabotaging the mission even at the expense of some of the other \r\ncrew member's lives.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Walter Pidgeon.\r\n=&gt;-Joan Fontaine.\r\n=&gt;-Barbara Eden.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Irwin Allen.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre...........................: Sci-Fi : Action : Fantasy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date....................: 1961.\r\n=&gt;-Language........................: English.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters........................: Named.\r\n=&gt;-File Size.......................: 1.24 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate................: 1 688 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime...................: 1h 44mn.\r\n=&gt;-Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/voyage_to_the_bottom_of_the_sea/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec...........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio....................: 2.35:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution......................: 1280 x 544.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate........................: 1 570 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec...........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels........................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate........................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate................: 217 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f4675fa94c696aac33910235327d556d4c8972","amp;dn":"Voyage+To+The+Bottom+Of+The+Sea+-+Action+1961+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f4675fa94c696aac33910235327d556d4c8972","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,244,103,95,169,76,105,106,172,51,145,2,53,50,125,85,109,76,137,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
