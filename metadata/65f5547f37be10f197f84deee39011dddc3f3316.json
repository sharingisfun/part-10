The song was Cetera's first hit single and was included on his 1986 album Solitude/Solitaire, and it was also featured on the soundtrack for the movie The Karate Kid, Part II.\n\nThe single peaked at #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on August 2, 1986, remaining in that spot for two weeks. It also spent five weeks atop the US adult contemporary chart. The song achieved similar success in other countries, peaking at #3 in the UK, where it was the 26th best-selling single of 1986.\n\nThe version of the song as released as a single and on Cetera's album Solitude/Solitare is edited, missing the beginning eight-second section of the song's bridge (which is heard in the actual Karate Kid II film).\n\nThe song earned nominations in 1987 for an Academy Award for Best Song and a Golden Globe in the category of Best Original Song. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award in 1987 for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Male Artist.\n\nIt went on to win an ASCAP Award for Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures and a BMI Film &amp; TV Award for Most Performed Song from a Film.\n\nCetera has stated that &quot;Glory of Love&quot; was originally written for the movie Rocky IV, and after the song was passed on, it was picked up by the producers for The Karate Kid, Part II \n \n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65f5547f37be10f197f84deee39011dddc3f3316","amp;dn":"Peter+Cetera+-+The+Glory+Of+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65f5547f37be10f197f84deee39011dddc3f3316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,245,84,127,55,190,16,241,151,248,77,238,227,144,17,221,220,63,51,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
