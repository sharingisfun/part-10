The library is disorganized and a bit crufty. The original curator included an extensive section on abstract algebra (good!), and a section on functional programming languages, such as ML, Erlang and F# (scratching my head, here.) I may repost a cleaned up version of the library.\n\nBest,\nM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a4b187243f978eda3960abd6e6a61cb569ba30f","amp;dn":"Category+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a4b187243f978eda3960abd6e6a61cb569ba30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,75,24,114,67,249,120,237,163,150,10,189,110,106,97,203,86,155,163,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
