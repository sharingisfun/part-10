As such, no \nnoise reduction (Dolby B/C or other) has been applied.  If one should choose to \ndo so subsequently- that of course is entirely up to you.\n\nI have trasferred all 3 cassettes to 3 CDs.  For ease in uploading the CD has \nbeen condensed and encoded in WMA format (192k).  I have incorporated my own \nchapter points- each track approximates to around 4-5 minutes.  I have labelled \nthe chapter points in accordance with the actual chapters of the book.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recording for it is by far the best audio reading of the \nbook and indeed outstrips any known dramatisation of the work to date- a \ntestament to the vocal abilities of the performer Nicol Williamson.  Each \ncharacter he voices- though there are many- all are given a unique identity.  \nThis together with incidental music throughout the recording adds to its \nperfection and all credit should be given to the Director Harley Usill.\n\n\n[?: Anyone think it's worth it to post a MP3 version of this? -FerraBit]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9915c02fa3bb915c1a92294d1841a03a5a5cdf44","amp;dn":"THE+HOBBIT+-+JRR+Tolkien.+Read+Nicol+Williamson-Abr-%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9915c02fa3bb915c1a92294d1841a03a5a5cdf44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,21,192,47,163,187,145,92,26,146,41,77,24,65,160,58,90,92,223,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
