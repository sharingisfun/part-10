The code examples feature syntax shading, code highlighting, rich commenting, line-by-line code walkthroughs and live program outputs. The book features thousands of lines of proven Swift code, and tips that will help you build robust applications.\r\n\r\nStart with an introduction to Swift using an early classes and objects approach, then rapidly move on to more advanced topics. When you master the material, youâ€™ll be ready to build industrial-strength object-oriented Swift applications.\r\n\r\nAbout This Book\r\n\r\nThe Swiftâ„¢ programming language was arguably the most significant announcement at Appleâ€™s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference. Although apps can still be developed in Objective-CÂ®, Apple says that Swift is its applications programming and systems programming language of the future.\r\n\r\nSwift is a contemporary language with simpler syntax than Objective-C. Because Swift is new, its designers were able to include popular programming language features from languages such as Objective-C, Javaâ„¢, C#, Ruby, PythonÂ® and many others. These features include automatic reference counting (ARC), type inference, optionals, String interpolation, tuples, closures (lambdas), extensions, generics, operator overloading, functions with multiple return values, switch statement enhancements and more. Weâ€™ve been able to develop apps more quickly in Swift than with Objective-C and the code is shorter, clearer and runs faster on todayâ€™s multi-core architectures.\r\n\r\nSwift also eliminates the possibility of many errors common in other languages, making your code more robust and secure. Some of these error-prevention features include no implicit conversions, ARC, no pointers, required braces around every control statementâ€™s body, assignment operators that do not return values, requiring initialization of all variables and constants before theyâ€™re used, array bounds checking, automatic checking for overflow of integer calculations, and more. You can combine Swift and Objective-C in the same app to enhance existing Objective-C apps without having to rewrite all the code. Your apps will easily be able to interact with the CocoaÂ®/Cocoa TouchÂ® frameworks, which are largely written in Objective-C.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the new Xcode playgrounds with Swift. A playground is an Xcode window in which you can enter Swift code that compiles and executes as you type it. This allows you to see and hear your codeâ€™s results as you write it, quickly find and fix errors, and conveniently experiment with features of Swift and the Cocoa/Cocoa Touch frameworks.\r\n\r\nPractical, Example-Rich Coverage of:\r\nClasses, Objects, Methods, Properties\r\nInitializers, Deinitializers, Bridging\r\nTuples, Array and Dictionary Collections\r\nStructures, Enumerations, Closures, ARC\r\nInheritance, Polymorphism, Protocols\r\nType Methods, Type Properties\r\nGenerics; Strings and Characters\r\nOperator Overloading, Operator Functions, Custom Operators, Subscripts\r\nAccess Control; Type Casting and Checking\r\nNested Types, Nested Methods\r\nOptionals, Optional Chaining, Extensions\r\nXcode, Playgrounds, Intro to Cocoa TouchÂ® with a Fully Coded iOSÂ® 8 Tip Calculator App\r\nOverflow Operators, Attributes, Patterns\r\nMore topics online\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT XCODE AND SWIFT: With Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2, Apple introduced several changes in Swift that affect the book's source code. Please visit www.deitel.com/books/iOS8FP1 for updated source code. The changes do not affect Xcode 6.2 users. You can download Xcode 6.2 from developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:632fa9a4ceb8a34d500494d0fb3d383981166abd","amp;dn":"Swift+for+Programmers+-+1st+Edition+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"632fa9a4ceb8a34d500494d0fb3d383981166abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,47,169,164,206,184,163,77,80,4,148,208,251,61,56,57,129,22,106,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
