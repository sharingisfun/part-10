Porta, T.   Griffin, C.   \n\nPublication Date: 2006 \nPublisher: Wiley-IEEE Press \nNumber of Pages: 448 \nEdition: 1 \nSubject Categories: Communication, Networking &amp; Broadcasting;   Components, Circuits, Devices &amp; Systems \nCopyright Year: 2006 \nISBN : 9780471784173\n\nABSTRACT\nThis excellent title introduces the concept of mission-oriented sensor networks as distributed dynamic systems of interacting sensing devices that are networked to jointly execute complex real-time missions under uncertainity. It provides the latest, yet unpublished results on the main technical and application challenges of mission-oriented sensor networks.\n\nThe authors of each chapter are research leaders from multiple disciplines who are presenting their latest innovations on the issues. Together, the editors have compiled a comprehensive treatment of the subject that flows smoothly from chapter to chapter. This interdisciplinary approach significantly enhances the science and technology knowledge base and influences the military and civilian applications of this field.\n\nAuthor Information:\n\nDr. Shashi Phoha is the Guest Editor of IEEE Transactions in Mobile Computing, Special Issue on Mission-Oriented Sensor Networks. She is the Head of the Information Sciences and Technology Division of ARL and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. She has led major research programs of multimillion dollars for military sensor networks in industry as well as in academia. In addition to more than a hundred journal articles, she authored or co-authored several books in related areas.\n\nDr. Thomas La Porta is the Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. He received his B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from The Cooper Union, New York, NY and his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY. He joined the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Penn State in 2002 as a Full Professor. He is Director of the Networking Research Center at Penn State.\n\nPrior to join ing Penn State, Dr. LaPorta was with Bell Laboratories since 1986. He was the Director of the Mobile Networking Research Department Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, where he led various projects in wireless and mobile networking. He is an IEEE Fellow, Bell Labs Fellow, received the Bell Labs Distinguished Technical Staff Award, and an Eta Kappa Nu Outstanding Young Electrical Engineer Award. He has published over 50 technical papers and holds over 20 patents.\n\nChristopher Griffin holds a Masters degree in Mathematics from Penn State and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. there. Mr. Griffin has worked as a research engineer at the Penn State Applied Research Laboratory for the last six years on several DARPA and or Army Research Laboratory sponsored programs, including: the Emergent Surveillance Plexus (ESP) program as a lead engineer; the DARPA sponsored Semantic Information Fusion program under the SensIT initiative, where he co-developed a distributed target tracking system and managed the development of a target classification algorithm using Level 1 sensor fusion techniques; as a co-principal software architect for the DARPA Joint Force Component Controller (JFACC) initiative, an adaptive C2 program aimed at improving Air Force response times; and he was the principal software architect for the Boeing/ARFL Insertion of Embedding Infosphere Technology (IEIST) program. His areas of research expertise are distributed tracking systems, mission oriented control, and system modeling.\n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFrontmatter\n \nOverview of MissionOriented Sensor Networks\n
