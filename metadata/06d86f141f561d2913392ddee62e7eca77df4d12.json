During a cold winter night Violet has to leave her warm bed to tell her neighbor to turn the music down. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when she meets sinister, scarred, scarily attractive security specialist, Joe Callahan.\n\nShe wants to deny it, but Violet canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t beat back the hunger she feels for Joe so she gives in again and again. Feeling it himself, Joe feeds ViÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hunger, breaking his own rules to keep her in his bed.\n\nEven though Violet had only one man in her life, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure Joe is giving her the signals and Vi decides sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready to take a second chance at life and, maybe, love. But Violet doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the dark secrets in JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past, secrets so soul-wrenching, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve drained him dry. With nothing left to give, JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to live his life alone and he breaks VioletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart.\n\nCrushed by JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s betrayal, Violet comes to terms with the fact that, no matter what signals he gave, Joe was not theirs to win. But VioletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murderer is obsessed with her and heartbreak again haunts the door of the Winters home. When it does Joe is forced to face the knowledge that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fight VioletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pull, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s under his skin and filled him full to bursting.\n\nJoe needs to win her back and put his life on the line to keep Violet safe. But, having had it all once, can Violet endure losing Joe?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06d86f141f561d2913392ddee62e7eca77df4d12","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+++At+Peace+++2011++ebook++%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06d86f141f561d2913392ddee62e7eca77df4d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,216,111,20,31,86,29,41,19,57,45,222,230,46,126,202,119,223,77,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
