The tracks on the bonus EP aren't available anywhere else, and if you're devoted enough to consider laying out for this deluxe box, you're probably most interested in what's on that fifth disc. There are a couple of Cheap Thrills outtakes, &amp;quot;It's a Deal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Crazy Once You Know How,&amp;quot; with a garagey feel and some typically scorching, uninhibited Big Brother lead guitar; it can be seen why they may not have been deemed strong enough for the album, but they're pretty cool to have. \nThe live versions of &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; (April 1969) and &amp;quot;Raise Your Hand&amp;quot; (October 1969) are okay, but not essential; of greater curiosity is the raw live charge through &amp;quot;Bo Diddley&amp;quot; (also October 1969). \nNote that this box does not include a good deal of material that has shown up on the Janis box, the Janis movie soundtrack, In Concert, and Farewell Song, so it's not a complete collection of Joplin's recordings.&amp;quot;\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCD 1\n\nArtist     : Janis Joplin with Big Brother &amp;amp;
