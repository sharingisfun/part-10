I am just making them available in one place, as L4Y.com has a single download limit unless you bought their &quot;gold service&quot;, which made making this torrent take longer than intended.\n\nThis is a listing of the mod files that *ARE* in this torrent:\n\t\n007_BETA_X1.zip\t\t\t34 MB\nAdrenalin.zip\t\t\t53.3 kB\na_second_chance_chapter1.zip\t22.4 MB\nBadCop3v0.9.8.rar\t\t42.9 MB\nbattletactics2.zip\t\t49.5 MB\nBloodNGuns2.zip\t\t\t143.5 kB\nCinema-2.0.zip\t\t\t37 MB\nclose_to_truth_mod_v0.0.8.zip\t16.9 MB\nCubed.zip\t\t\t30.8 MB\nDA_wicked_mod.zip\t\t53.4 kB\ndeepblue3.zip\t\t\t3.5 MB\nDifficultyModV-1.zip\t\t21.7 kB\nDoomed.zip\t\t\t10.6 MB\nexcessiveblood+cinema.zip\t25.9 MB\nExcessiveBlood.zip\t\t3 MB\nFPS_mod.zip\t\t\t5 kB\nhandgunsmod.zip\t\t\t3.5 MB\nHellsingMod07Beta.rar\t\t7.5 MB\nJuicy2.zip\t\t\t801.8 kB\nkungfu.samji-edition.zip\t13.2 MB\nkungfu_10.zip\t\t\t8.7 MB\nLHOOQ1.zip\t\t\t30.2 MB\nMatrixEdition-v1.1.zip\t\t39.1 MB\nMatrixEditionV2.zip\t\t37.9 MB\nMaxPayneHardcoreBeta2.zip\t20.8 MB\nMaxPayneKewlGuy-maxpaynenewguy.zip\t4 MB\nMix-Payne.zip\t\t\t59 MB\nMP2_Er4serMod-v17.zip\t\t34.8 MB\nMP2_Vice_City_Mod.zip\t\t2.7 MB\nMurphtrix.zip\t\t\t38.1 MB\nNeuroticV1.zip\t\t\t1424 kB\nNewDawn-DMW.zip\t\t\t55 MB\nNG404KunjuDeSuchiro-NG404.zip\t43.3 MB\nnightfever3_alpha.zip\t\t4.8 MB\nPlazaRaidv14.zip\t\t59.5 MB\nRealisticmod15.zip\t\t2.7 MB\nRezzieModv33.zip\t\t15.0 MB\nricomodv2.0_final.zip\t\t8.5 MB\nSamLake_10.zip\t\t\t1312.3 kB\nshoot_through.zip\t\t1990 B\nSilencedBerettav2.0.zip\t\t554.9 kB\nsketchbooksam.zip\t\t12.7 MB\nSpecial Ops 1.0.zip\t\t8.7 MB\nStopmotion.zip\t\t\t83 kB\nStranglehold Mod 1.0.rar\t62 MB\nTheBigReveal.zip\t\t72.5 MB\nThe Black Steel Project.zip\t17.9 MB\nThePunisherMod.zip\t\t33.4 MB\nthermalmod.zip\t\t\t508 kB\nTMFGrandslamFinal.zip\t\t18.2 MB\nUniform_-_Shots_Fired.zip\t7.7 MB\nUpgradesMod.zip\t\t\t47 MB\nVampireslayer1.0.zip\t\t34.4 MB\nVercingetorix-vercmod.zip\t4.2 MB\n\n\nI promise these are the real mods, I kept them zipped/rarred to ease the amount of time it would take to download them. \nYou may like them, or not. \nI like most of them.\n\nWARNING: &quot;MaxPayneHardcoreBeta2&quot; mod will autoexit the program if you use cheats, I can confirm it for &quot;coder&quot;, but not others.\nALSO WARNING: &quot;UpgradesMod&quot; is a challenge to install (you have to work for it), but its also good, so there it is.\n\nI give no warrantee or guarantee that these will work on your computer, if you want to tell someone a bug or glitch, track down the person/people who made it and tell them. This isn't the movie, nor is it the full game or even The House Bunny\n(If someone uploads that last one, a bunch of people will be happy. ;o )\nIt's Max Payne 2's mods that I have found. &quot;ENJOY THE SPAGETTEH!&quot;\n\n\n********************************************************************************\nThese are the files that were too big to put in here, otherwise this would be a 4gigish download...\n********************************************************************************\nREPEAT: THESE FOLLOWING FILES ARE NOT IN THIS TORRENT!\n(They may possibly be in the Part II if the demand is there)\nThere are more mods than this, but L4Y makes it maddening to get them all.\nYou may find some I don't even mention, I know it.\n\n(www.levels4you.com or www.filefront.com has them, and I will mark them as either one here, because while I want to give you guys alot of Max Payne 2 mods, I just don't have the bandwidth to keep a 4gig file going or even started, sorry. :( )\n\n(When the file is available on both sites, use FileFront. \nIt's faster, as there is not a 75kbps limit, as there is on Levels4You, \nhowever, if there is an updated file, it is more likely to be found on L4Y.)\n\t\n7th_Serpent_Crossfire.zip\t\t159.3 MB\tFF&amp;L4Y\nElements-Of-Style-Version-1.5.rar\t358.6 MB\tFF&amp;L4Y\nEQgunkatasv3.rar\t\t\t137.0 MB\tFF&amp;L4Y\nHellsingMod_Part2.rar\t\t\t231.0 MB\tFF\nHoM_Release06a.zip\t\t\t204.3 MB\tFF&amp;L4Y\nkmg-maxpayne2.mods-v1.0.zip\t\t101.4 MB\tFF\nMaxPayneUniversityv1_0.zip\t\t159.4 MB\tFF\nMontana1.5.rar\t\t\t\t270.7 MB\tL4Y\nMPChronicles.zip\t\t\t221.7 MB\tFF&amp;L4Y\nnewchowmodbeta.rar\t   \t\t183.9 MB\tFF\nNewDawn.zip\t\t\t\t276.8 MB\tFF&amp;L4Y\nStreetFighter.rar\t\t\t659.4 MB\tFF&amp;L4Y\n\nNOTE: I do not suggest &quot;StreetFighter&quot;s contents, as it balloons up to 1.7GB unrarred, and I did not find it worth that much space, as I had a hard time making any punches connect, even when the enemy was right in front of me. You may find it more fun, as well as having alot of changes and recreated SF characters, but that is for you to decide.\n\nUL by: djteka","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:904c8a72e9d9ba2c5ca9032c429875965e5c5c3e","amp;dn":"Max+Payne+2+Mods+%2850%2B+Mods%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"904c8a72e9d9ba2c5ca9032c429875965e5c5c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,76,138,114,233,217,186,44,92,169,3,44,66,152,117,150,94,92,92,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
