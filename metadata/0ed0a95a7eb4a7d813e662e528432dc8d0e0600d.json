The compatible flute of Nicola Stilo wonderfully complements Baker's dry, unemotional sound, while the addition of a third horn, Diane Varvra's soprano sax, adds body to the sound. A very strong rhythm section of pianist Michel Grailler, bassist Riccardo dal FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â , and drummer Leo Mitchell rounds out a tight, well-groomed collective. Baker is in fine form, but he skips the vocals. Bruno Martino's &quot;Estate&quot; is hauntingly rendered, while J.J. Johnson's &quot;Lament&quot; is given an attractive reading. This amounts to a very accessible, enjoyable set of tunes - one that may not win any awards, but should reward those who appreciate the delicate and lovely nature of Chet Baker's art.\n\nChet Baker - Trumpet\nNicola Stilo - Flute\nDiane Varvra - Soprano Sax\nMichel Grailler - Piano\nRiccardo Dal FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  - Bass\nLeo Mitchel - Drums\n\n01.
