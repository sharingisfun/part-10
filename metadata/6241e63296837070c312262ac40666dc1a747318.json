Molly, her lover Jack, granddaughter Nemain, and young apprentice Hob become aware that they are being stalked by something terrible. The refuge they seek in a monastery, then an inn, and finally a Norman castle proves to be an illusion. As danger continues to rise, it becomes clear that the creature must be faced and defeatedÃ¢â‚¬â€or else they will all surely die. It is then that Hob discovers how much more there is to his adopted family than he had realized.\n\nAn intoxicating blend of fantasy and mythology, Something Red presents an enchanting world full of mysterious and fascinating charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€ shapeshifters, sorceresses, warrior monks, and knightsÃ¢â‚¬â€where no one is safe from the terrible being that lurks in the darkness. In this extraordinary, fantastical world, nothing is as it seems, and the journey for survival is as magical as it is perilous","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6241e63296837070c312262ac40666dc1a747318","amp;dn":"Something+Red+-+Douglas+Nicholas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6241e63296837070c312262ac40666dc1a747318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,65,230,50,150,131,112,112,195,18,38,42,196,6,102,220,26,116,115,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
