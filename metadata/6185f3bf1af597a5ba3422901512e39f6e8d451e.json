The book begins with a discovery of what engineers do as well as an inside look into the various areas of specialization. An explanation on good study habits and what it takes to succeed is included as well as an introduction to design and problem solving, communication, and ethics. Once this foundation is established, the book moves on to the basic physical concepts and laws that students will encounter regularly. The framework of this text teaches students that engineers apply physical and chemical laws and principles as well as mathematics to design, test, and supervise the production of millions of parts, products, and services that people use every day. By gaining problem solving skills and an understanding of fundamental principles, students are on their way to becoming analytical, detail-oriented, and creative engineers.\nISBN13: 9781439062081\nISBN10: 1439062080","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6185f3bf1af597a5ba3422901512e39f6e8d451e","amp;dn":"Engineering+Fundamentals+4th+Edition+-+Saeed+Moaveni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6185f3bf1af597a5ba3422901512e39f6e8d451e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,133,243,191,26,245,151,165,186,52,34,144,21,18,227,159,110,141,69,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
