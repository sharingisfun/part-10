This sweet assortment of wrist-ees from tiny owl knits designer Stephanie Dosen brings together an adorable cast of critters that includes a Badger, Owl, Deer, Wolf, and Racoon. This whimsically delightful collection includes the instructions for the wrist-ees along with charted instructions for your new furry friends. Worked from the top-down, the wrist-ees are worked flat using stranded instarsia or you can choose to adorn your wrist-ees with the animals by using duplicate stitch afterwards. Each of the five wrist-ees are finished off with The Woodsy Association charms - the cute little feathers, tails, paws, and antlers that dangle at the wrist. Wear them in the forest with pride and The Woodsy Association will know you are a friend to the animals!\n\nThe wrist-ees in The Woodsy Association collection are sized for s-xl (3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75&quot; wide).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c74f4e555ab0502abfe1d3b7876b5db56e8c3da9","amp;dn":"The+Woodsy+Association+-+A+Tiny+Owl+Knits+Pattern+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c74f4e555ab0502abfe1d3b7876b5db56e8c3da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,79,78,85,90,176,80,42,191,225,211,183,135,107,93,181,110,140,61,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
