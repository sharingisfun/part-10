To solve this we would use PyGame which makes it easy to both understand the very basics of game programming and python. By analyzing how we create a breakout game (ball that bounces onto bricks) from 0 to 100, we will get a good sense of how we can use Python and PyGame together. At the end of the course we will have a playable breakout game that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written from start to stop using Python together with PyGame.\n\nBy: Filip Ekberg\n\nLanguage: English\nPublished Year: 2013\nResolution: 1024x768\nVideo: WMV VC-1 Advanced Profile, ratio 4:3, 15fps, 384 Kbps\nAudio: WMA  Windows Media Audio 9.2, 48.0 KHz, stereo, 192kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f8530e728f822a239a20721345f3e83815ca248","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+Game+Programming+with+Python+and+PyGame+-+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f8530e728f822a239a20721345f3e83815ca248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,133,48,231,40,248,34,162,57,162,7,33,52,95,62,131,129,92,162,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
