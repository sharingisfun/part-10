Passage after biblical passage, with rabbinic interpretation, relate the Old Covenant's fulfillment in the Messiah. For two decades, Jesus Was a Jew has proven itself an incredibly powerful witnessing tool to Jewish people, and it is ideal for Jewish friends who are skeptical of your faith, but willing to read.\n\nAbout the author:\nUpon graduating from high school, Arnold was forced by his father to leave home because of his faith. In 1962, he began undergraduate education at Shelton College in New Jersey. Transferring to Ohio's Cedarville College, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Hebrew and Greek in 1966. He then moved to Israel, where he studied archaeology, ancient history, historical geography, and Hebrew at the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. During this time, he witnessed the historic Six-Day War in 1967. Later that year, Arnold returned to the U.S. and entered Dallas Theological Seminary for studies in Hebrew and Old Testament. He also began working as a missionary with ABMJ (today, Chosen People Ministries)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0dfc3fef0dfbe6d43e6908ffc42a41489a6f6f","amp;dn":"Jesus+Was+A+Jew+-+Arnold+Fruchtenbaum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0dfc3fef0dfbe6d43e6908ffc42a41489a6f6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,13,252,63,239,13,251,230,212,62,105,8,255,196,42,65,72,154,111,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
