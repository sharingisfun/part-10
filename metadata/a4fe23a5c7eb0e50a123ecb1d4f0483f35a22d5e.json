Since then, that certain band called Queen have released 26 albums and sold over 300 million records worldwide. The popularity of Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon is stronger than ever. Their story is a remarkable one, a narrative that covers early struggles, huge obstacles, success, arguments, breakups, triumph, tragedy and an enduring legacy - all against a backdrop of brilliant music and stunning live performances from every corner of the globe. The band members tell their own story, guiding us through an extensive archive full of hitherto unseen footage, revealing how four strong-minded individuals, all capable of writing massive hit songs, worked together so successfully for four decades. Queen never did anything by halves - meaning their highs were massive, but their lows catastrophic. It is a compelling story told with intelligence, wit, plenty of humour and painful honesty.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1808 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 850 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fe23a5c7eb0e50a123ecb1d4f0483f35a22d5e","amp;dn":"BBC+Queen+Days+of+Our+Lives+1of2+576p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4fe23a5c7eb0e50a123ecb1d4f0483f35a22d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,254,35,165,199,235,14,80,161,35,236,177,212,240,72,63,53,162,45,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
