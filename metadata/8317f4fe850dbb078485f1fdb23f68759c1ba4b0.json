In his introductory essay, John Cooper explains the presentation of these works, discusses questions concerning the chronology of their composition, comments on the dialogue form in which Plato wrote, and offers guidance on approaching the reading and study of Plato's works. Also included are concise introductions to each translation, meticulous annotation designed to serve both scholar and general reader, and a comprehensive index.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8317f4fe850dbb078485f1fdb23f68759c1ba4b0","amp;dn":"Plato+-+Complete+Works+%28Hackett%29+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8317f4fe850dbb078485f1fdb23f68759c1ba4b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,23,244,254,133,13,187,7,132,133,241,253,178,63,104,117,156,27,164,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
