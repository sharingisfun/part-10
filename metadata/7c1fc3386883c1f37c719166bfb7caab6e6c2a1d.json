For anyone even remotely interested in film music, they are a must-listen.\n\nThe real consideration is the worth of this specific set, the Star Wars Trilogy: The Original Soundtrack Anthology. \nWith a single compact disc for each of the three featured scores and a single disc of additional material, that \nleaves this set's 4 CDs well shy of the combined length of the Special Edition soundtrack albums, which devote 2 \nCDs to each film for a total of 6. Comparing the runtimes, the Anthology runs roughly 83 minutes shorter, \njust over a full CD's worth of material.\n\nWhy, then, is this out-of-print, &quot;antiquated&quot; set still worth seeking out? There are two primary reasons:\n\n1) As the Anthology was released in 1993, it predates the Special Edition releases of the films, which means it \ncontains two tracks from the original, unaltered versions of the original trilogy that were replaced on the \nReturn of the Jedi Special Edition soundtrack - namely, &quot;Lapti Nek,&quot; sung in Jabba's palace (replaced by the \nexecrable &quot;Jedi Rocks&quot;), and &quot;Ewok Celebration,&quot; which was a replaced by a more generic cue to complement the \nnew montage of planets celebrating the fall of the Galactic Empire. Having been introduced to Star Wars via the \npre-Special Edition versions of the films, the latter track in particular is a welcome find even if I don't \nparticularly mind the alteration in the film itself.\n\n2) For the latter two scores in the series, the Anthology has arguably superior sound quality. The Empire Special \nEdition suffers from poor mixing that keeps the soundstage small and pinched throughout much of the score and Jedi \nhas undergone such strenuous noise reduction that in places it sounds terribly muffled, almost as though you've \nstuffed your ears with cotton before pressing the play button. The Anthology versions of these scores, however, \nsound full-bodied and vivid, with a terrific, enveloping soundstage that absorbs you right into the music. There's \na touch of wetness to the sound, but it's still remarkably detailed. This isn't to say that the mastering of the \nAnthology is perfect -- there's a small but noticeable amount of background hiss (particularly in Star Wars) and \nthe occasional crackle or artifact -- but overall it's a much more pleasurable and immersive listen than the often \ncramped sound of the Special Edition albums.\n\nI have yet to mention the packaging, which consists of the four CDs each located in their own jewel case and an \noversized booklet filled with behind-the-scenes photographs of the recording sessions and the late Ralph McQuarrie's \nwonderful conceptual artwork for the films as well as an introduction written by Nicholas Meyer and track-by-track \nliner notes by Film Score Monthly editor Lukas Kendall (which, while good, aren't quite as all-encompassing or \nwell-written as Mike Matessino's comprehensive efforts for the RCA Special Editions), all housed in a handsome box. \nA bit difficult to place on the shelf perhaps, but truly evocative of a element of deluxe album production that has \nall but disappeared in today's age of lossy MP3 downloads.\n\nAs the last refuge for cues discarded from the Special Editions of the films and the best commercially-available \nmixes for both Empire and Jedi, the Star Wars Trilogy: The Original Soundtrack Anthology is a must for fans of \nJohn Williams' music.\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: John Williams\nAlbum: Star Wars Trilogy The Original Soundtrack Anthology\nGenre: Soundtrack / Classical / Film Score\nSource: 4 x CD Box Set\nAlbum Release Year.: 1993\nLabel: Arista Records / 20th Century Fox Film Scores\nBarcode: 078221101226\nNumber of Tracks: 75\nTotal Duration: 4:58:08\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless and MP3\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.2.1\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME 3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 730 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps (Constant Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44100 Hz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: Scans (Plus Embedded Artwork Within FLAC / MP3 Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE Sheets, MD5, FFP, SFV and M3U\nTotal File Size: 2.28 GB\nEncoder: BSW\n\nTrack Listings\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/92975498114913624930.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/92975498114913624930.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCD 1 - Star Wars [1977]\n\n01.
