J. Scott\n(Descriptions courtesy Amazon)\n\n\nBook 1 - Highland Legacy\n\nFaced with an abhorrent betrothal, Cailin Macmillan flees her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s castle and quickly learns that a woman traveling alone in Medieval Scotland is an easy target for ruthless English soldiers. When Highland patriot Connor Fraser comes to her aid, his steadfast dedication to king and country is challenged by his overwhelming desire to protect CailinÃ¢â‚¬â€even if he must marry her to do so.\n\nAccused of murdering one of her attackers and determined to rely on her own resourcefulness, Cailin dresses as a lad, intent on seeking refuge at the camp of Robert the Bruce.
