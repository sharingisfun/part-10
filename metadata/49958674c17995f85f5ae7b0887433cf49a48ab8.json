Sullivan began playing the guitar at 3, and his remarkable ability came to national attention at 6, when Ellen DeGeneres, who often showcases child prodigies, invited him to play on her show. But his career did not truly take off until 2009, when Mr. Guy, the Chicago bluesman, invited him on tour after meeting him backstage at a show. Mr. Guy also produced Mr. SullivanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cyclone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Blues Chart in 2011. Sullivan made a guest appearance on Buddy Guy's Grammy-nominated album Skin Deep, released in 2008. His solo can be heard on the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who's Gonna Fill Those Shoes.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. My Sweet Guitar [Hambridge, Sullivan] \n2. Ten Years Down the Road [Fleming, Hambridge] \n3.
