Clownin' with the World (with Willie Love)\n2. Goin' in Your Direction\n3. Down and Out Blues\n4. Keep It To Ourselves\n5. King Buscuit Time\n6. The Real Folk Blues\n7. More Real Folk Blues\n8. Bummer Road\n9. One Way Out\n\n\nAll albums are neatly tagged and embedded with front album covers.\n\n\nPlease seed for a while :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5281c0b2d786eef9d957907ba1129f86d413fe51","amp;dn":"Sonny+Boy+Williamson+II+-+9+Albums+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5281c0b2d786eef9d957907ba1129f86d413fe51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,129,192,178,215,134,238,249,217,87,144,123,161,18,159,134,212,19,254,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
