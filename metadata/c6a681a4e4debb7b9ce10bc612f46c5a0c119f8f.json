The guest being Isaac Hayes look alike Manu Dibango, African sax legendary funkster most famous for his &quot;Soul Makossa &quot; and the odd coupling creates some memorable music. Of course the backing of the Cuarteto Patria gives the disc the distictive overall Cuban flavor but Dibango colors the palette to give it a different sound. His sax livens up the music, as if it needs to be more festive for some intoxicating happy rhythmns. Dibango chimes in vocally with his signature &quot;makossas&quot; and Ochoa encourages him as they seem to be having a ball making this recording. The instrument duets by Ochoa and Dibango are unique and extremely lively. The songs have almost an improvisational quality as the interplay between sax and guitar, African and Cuban vocalist, create some musical magic. Ochoa carries the load on this disc but it is a close partnership and colloboration between all the musicians. On track five, &quot;El Yerbero&quot; Ochoa delivers a beauty, praisinfg the healthful herb benefits of ruda,epazote etc. for a nice version of the song made famous by Celia Cruz.Ochoa demostrates his guitar virtousity throughout, often leading into some tasty give and take interplay with Dibango before Ochoa takes over lead vocals. &quot;Quizas, Quizas&quot; is a beautiful pure intrumental version(with the exception of a few chants ) of the classic bolero that retains it&amp;#039;s romantic qualities but gently moves just enough to get you swaying. There are several well known numbers but performed quite differently, including &quot;Cosita Linda, &quot; which as a result of the jazzy textures and interpretations take on a life of their own. All the songs are excellent and work in spite of the seemigly disparate styles of these two giants and leaders in their own right. The interaction of the dissimiliar styles creates one of the best Ochoa efforts to date. This is definitely one of the lesser known Ochoa/Dibango releases but extremely worth seeking out and adding to your collection. Highly recommended for fans of world music, Cuban music or the airy wailing, funky sax of Manu Dibango.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
