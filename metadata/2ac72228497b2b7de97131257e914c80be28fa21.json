Cinnamon, honey, dates, almonds, apples, and pomegranateÃ¢â‚¬â€in this stunning book of recipes, Anne Shooter has created cakes and bakes that celebrate these wonderful traditional ingredients. Anne has always been inspired by her Jewish familyÃ¢â‚¬â€her grandmothers, mother, and aunts who baked honey cake, almond cookies, cinnamon balls, rich challah bread, and cheesecakes. Here she gives these traditional recipes a very modern interpretation to create her own collection of bakes and cakes for every occasion. A cinnamon coffee cake from the U.S. via Eastern Europe; an apple and blackberry traybake; pomegranate drizzle cake from Jerusalem; flourless chocolate, pistachio, and walnut brownies; halva shortbread; and a chocolate challah bread and butter pudding. But this is evolution, not revolution, and Anne has also kept precious family recipes for tahini cookies, smoked haddock puff pastries and the bagels and rye breads from her childhood. If you love baking, these recipes will take you on a delightful, delicious journey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac72228497b2b7de97131257e914c80be28fa21","amp;dn":"Sesame+%26amp%3B+Spice+-+Anne+Shooter+%28epub%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac72228497b2b7de97131257e914c80be28fa21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,199,34,40,73,123,43,125,233,113,49,37,126,145,76,128,190,40,250,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
