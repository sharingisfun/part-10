This package not only includes an impeccably detailed rendition of KTVL, but over 500 square km of beautifully detailed surrounding area to explore. Immerse yourself as you fly amongst the alpine lakes and bush of the Sierra Nevada, enjoy the stunning vistas of the mountain ranges on both sides of the airport as you approach from the lake, and when you're done, shut down your engines and have a bite to eat at the flight deck at KTVL, or alternatively, hire a bike from Mountain West aviation at the FBO and ride down to South Lake Tahoe or Stateline to enjoy the bustling high life with fine restaurants, casinos and lakeside beaches! You can also pop in during the long winter season (November-March) and hit the slopes of Heavenly mountain (we have operational ski lifts!), or chuck your skis onto your favourite bush aircraft and head to the Sierras and land on one of the hundreds of frozen over lakes.
