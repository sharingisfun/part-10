In Ã¢â‚¬Å“CasablancaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Dooley Wilson omitted the verse and cut to the chorus.\n\nThe song was voted No. 2 on the AFI's Ã¢â‚¬Å“100 Years...100 SongsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-special, commemorating the best songs in film.\n\n\nVarious Artists\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As Time Goes ByÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Versions\n\n2014\n\nfeat.
