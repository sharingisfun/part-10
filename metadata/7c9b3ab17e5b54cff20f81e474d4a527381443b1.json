What they got was merely a decent album, listenable, danceable, yet lacking that extra flash of Latin fire.  Sanchez leads his usual eight-piece ensemble -- augmented at Yoshi's by Mike Whitman on baritone sax -- and feeds the percussive polyrhythmic battles with his congas (as well as a turn on the timbales on &quot;Guaripumpe&quot; ). On the &quot;Latin soul&quot; agenda, there is a dead-on faithful rendition of &quot;Watermelon Man,&quot; with a few histrionic things at the close, and a reprise of Eddie Harris' &quot;Cold Duck Time,&quot; which soon turns into &quot;Listen Here&quot; and &quot;Everything I Play Gonh Be Funky.&quot;  There are also some spirited passings of the bop baton from trumpeter Sal Cracchiolo to trombonist Francisco Torres to tenor saxophonist Scott Martin and back again on &quot;Ican.&quot; ~ Richard S.
