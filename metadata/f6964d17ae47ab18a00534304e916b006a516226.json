Heinrich Harrer, already one of the greatest mountaineers of his time, was climbing in the Himalayas when war broke out in Europe. He was imprisoned by the British in India but succeeded in escaping and fled to Tibet. Settling in Lhasa, the Forbidden City, where he became a friend and tutor to the Dalai Lama, Heinrich Harrer spent seven years gaining a more profound understanding of Tibet and the Tibetans than any Westerner before him.\n\n\nSeven Years in Tibet was translated into 53 languages, became a best seller in the United States in 1954, and sold three million copies.\n\n\n\nNarrator:\n=========\nDavid Case (73) classically trained London-born actor who recorded more than 700 books on audiotape. Case's 20-year recording career largely ended in 2000 when he developed throat cancer. He died in El Sobrante, California on October 1, 2005.\n\n\nA highly respected and enthusiastic audiobook narrator, David Case specialized in creating unique and interesting character voices. AudioFile magazine named him a Golden Voice, writing after he died in 2005 that &quot;David's cultured British voice, his flair for accents and dialects, and his comedic timing made him one of the industry's most sought-after narrators.&quot; He narrated over 700 audiobooks. In one of his last interviews, David said, &quot;I really believe I was born to record audiobooks.&quot; Fans everywhere tend to agree. \n\n\nRef:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270032.Seven_Years_in_Tibet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270032.Seven_Years_in_Tibet&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120102/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120102/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years_in_Tibet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years_in_Tibet&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6964d17ae47ab18a00534304e916b006a516226","amp;dn":"Seven+Years+in+Tibet+-+Heinrich+Harrer%2C+read+by+David+Case.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6964d17ae47ab18a00534304e916b006a516226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,150,77,23,174,71,171,24,160,5,52,48,78,145,107,0,106,81,98,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
