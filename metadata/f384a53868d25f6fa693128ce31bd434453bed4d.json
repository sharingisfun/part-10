The style she cultivated on her debut -- a glorious mix of the singer/songwriter with the rootsy, acoustic instruments of her native Mali -- is refined here, and she approaches everything with more confidence. She\\'s very much a rarity in African terms, a female singer/songwriter, and one whose lyrics are very progressive, dealing with the rights of women in a patriarchal society. But she\\'s representative of a new generation that has brought forth a lot of professional women, for whom she\\'s become a figurehead. She lauds hard work, her people, and the freedom to love. Her own acoustic guitar work might be relatively simple, but the arrangements of her band fill out the sound wonderfully, especially the large, xylophone-like balafon and the n\\'goni, a kind of lute.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f384a53868d25f6fa693128ce31bd434453bed4d","amp;dn":"Rokia+Traore+-+Wanita+%5B2000%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f384a53868d25f6fa693128ce31bd434453bed4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,132,165,56,104,210,95,111,166,147,18,140,227,27,212,52,69,59,237,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
