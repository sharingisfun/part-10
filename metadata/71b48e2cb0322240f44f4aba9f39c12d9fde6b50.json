Drawing considerable influence from American soul music of the time, Boothe's deep, robust style was in dramatic contrast to the harmonized falsettos that dominated rocksteady groups. EVERYTHING I OWN includes popular hits from his repertoire, as well as covers of well-known soul classics, including  ...  Bill Withers's &quot;Ain't No Sunshine.&quot;\n\n\n\nmp3   320kbps\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71b48e2cb0322240f44f4aba9f39c12d9fde6b50","amp;dn":"%28Dub+-+Reggae%29+Ken+Boothe+-+Everything+I+Own+%5BDefinitive+2CDs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71b48e2cb0322240f44f4aba9f39c12d9fde6b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,180,142,44,176,50,34,64,244,79,74,186,159,57,193,45,159,222,107,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
