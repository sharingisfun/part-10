Over the course of two discs and 32 songs, the retrospective winds through all of the group's biggest songs -- not just the hit singles, but the album radio favorites and concert staples that kept the group popular on the charts and in the arenas until last third of the '80s (and, for the record, everything on the previous Greatest Hits record is here). The key to the collection is that it doesn't abide strict chronological order. Instead, it's divided into two, with all the biggest hits on the first disc and the second acting like a &quot;more of the best&quot; collection, and within each of the discs, the tracks flow like a concert. The result is a first-class, definitive collection for the serious Journey listener (and, despite many skeptics, there are many out there -- which is not hard to understand, since arena rock never got any better than this)..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Only The Young\n[02] Don't Stop Believin'\n[03] Wheel In The Sky\n[04] Faithfully\n[05] Any Way You Want It\n[06] Ask The Lonely\n[07] Who's Crying Now\n[08] Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\n[09] Lights\n[10] Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\n[11] Open Arms\n[12] Girl Can't Help It\n[13] Send Her My Love\n[14] When You Love A Woman\n[15] I'll Be Alright Without You\n[16] After The Fall\n\nPlay Time - 01h:06m:47s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Chain Reaction\n[02] Message Of Love\n[03] Somethin' To Hide\n[04] Line Of Fire [Live]\n[05] Anytime\n[06] Stone In Love\n[07] Patiently\n[08] Good Morning Girl\n[09] The Eyes Of A Woman\n[10] Be Good To Yourself\n[11] Still They Ride\n[12] Baby I'm A Leavin' You\n[13] Mother, Father\n[14] Just The Same Way\n[15] Escape\n[16] The Party's Over (Hopelessly In Love)\n\nPlay Time - 01h:02m:39s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:09m:26s\nTotal File Size....................... 903mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
