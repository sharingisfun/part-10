In the opening stages Arthur C. Clarke explained how there were four stages in the way scientists react to the development of anything of a revolutionary nature. \n\n\\\\\\&quot;Free energy\\\\\\&quot; was now working its way through these four stages of reaction, which were: a: \\\\\\&quot;It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s nonsense,\\\\\\&quot; b: \\\\\\&quot;It is not important,\\\\\\&quot; c: \\\\\\&quot;I always said it was a good idea,\\\\\\&quot; and d: \\\\\\&quot;I thought of it first.\\\\\\&quot; The scene moved to Rome, Georgia where Jim Griggs of Hydrodynamics, Inc. demonstrated the assembly and operation of a \\\\\\&quot;hydrosonic water pump\\\\\\&quot; which operated over-unity by producing hot water or steam with energy in excess of the electrical energy input to the pump motor.\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Over-unity\\\\\\&quot; was confirmed by satisfied customers, including the Albany Fire Station, where engineers from the \\\\\\&quot;local university\\\\\\&quot; and the \\\\\\&quot;local power company\\\\\\&quot; had been called in to verify the over-100% efficiency.\n\nMore info: http://www.docuworld.org/component/option,com_mtree/task,report/link_id,251/Itemid,30/\n\nMPG File Details\n================================================================================================\nName.........: Equinox (Dec 1995) It Runs on Water - Free Energy - Overunity (50m18s) ConRes.mpg\nFilesize.....: 501 MB (or 513,878 KB or 526,211,700 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:50:18 (209,295 fr)\nVideo Codec..: MPEG Video Decoder\nVideo Bitrate: ?\nAudio Codec..: MPEG Audio Decoder\nAudio Bitrate: ?\nFrame Size...: 352 x 288 (1.3:1)\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nEnjoy! :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69cf6e986b910a04171774d898378575cfa7bfcb","amp;dn":"Equinox+%28Dec+1995%29+It+Runs+on+Water+-+Free+Energy+-+Overunity+%285","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69cf6e986b910a04171774d898378575cfa7bfcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,207,110,152,107,145,10,4,23,23,116,216,152,55,133,117,207,167,191,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
