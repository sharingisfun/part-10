With 21st Century C, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover up-to-date techniques that are absent from every other C text available. C isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just the foundation of modern programming languages, it is a modern language, ideal for writing efficient, state-of-the-art applications. Learn to dump old habits that made sense on mainframes, and pick up the tools you need to use this evolved and aggressively simple language. No matter what programming language you currently champion, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll agree that C rocks.\n\n- Set up a C programming environment with shell facilities, makefiles, text editors, debuggers, and memory checkers\n- Use Autotools, CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s de facto cross-platform package manager\n- Learn which older C concepts should be downplayed or deprecated\n- Explore problematic C concepts that are too useful to throw out\n- Solve CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s string-building problems with C-standard and POSIX-standard functions\n- Use modern syntactic features for functions that take structured inputs\n- Build high-level object-based libraries and programs\n- Apply existing C libraries for doing advanced math, talking to Internet servers, and running databases\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: The Environment\nChapter 1.
