His teacher sets off to screw him over, however, as he schemes to turn over his grandfather's mountain property to realtors so he and his brother can make a sum. Jun protests, but in the end fails to change anything. The message is obviously anti- materialistic, but also implies that in a world full of rotten people, faith is futile and won't get you far.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Uta AKA Poem.1972.DVDRip.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 129 Kbps\nLength            : 1.77 GiB for 1h 59mn 21s 362ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 935 Kbps\nAspect            : 658 x 344 (2.265) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1033501/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1033501/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32384adda1848ffd0d6175778fb63346f91da9f6","amp;dn":"Uta+AKA+Poem.1972.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32384adda1848ffd0d6175778fb63346f91da9f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,56,74,221,161,132,143,253,13,97,117,119,143,182,51,70,249,29,169,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
