The Empire of the Rising Sun, the Soviets, and the U.S. are all vying for control of the world, and you must lead one of them to world domination! Take control of brand-new units, all with different capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Mech units can transform into helicopters to climb cliffs and ledges, but can't fire in the air. Build massive zeppelins to destroy your enemy's bases. The entire storyline is played cooperatively, be it AI or with a friend. Battle your way through 27 different missions as each faction. 65 minutes of full motion video tell the story in full HD glory!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda6bc0fd08238bc90cb706a2de0a5e02cebd17d","amp;dn":"Command+%26amp%3B+Conquer+Red+Alert+3+RF+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda6bc0fd08238bc90cb706a2de0a5e02cebd17d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,166,188,15,208,130,56,188,144,203,112,106,45,224,165,224,44,235,209,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
