Why Israel is the Victim and Why There is No Peace in the Middle East sets the record straight about the basic truths of the Middle East conflict. In addition to restoring the authentic history of the region--a history of obsessive aggression first by Arab countries determined to destroy Israeli statehood and later by terror groups determined to destroy its will to survive--this booklet brings the story up to date by showing the systematic way in which Hamas and Hezbollah, under Iran's direction, have subverted peace in the Middle East. Every time a settlement that would bring peace to the region and a state to the Palestinians, these radical forces once again turned to violence. They have waged a war of attrition counting on time to be on their side because of the assistance of Western leftist groups that flippantly propagate myths about &quot;occupation&quot; and &quot;oppression&quot; designed to isolate, demoralize, and defeat Israel.\n\nAuthor: David Horowitz\nPublisher: David Horowitz Freedom Center\nPublication Date: February 5, 2009\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJew-haters...commence hating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395b04551a84c34294d46fba310f65ee70e1df25","amp;dn":"David+Horowitz+-+Why+Israel+is+the+Victim...+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395b04551a84c34294d46fba310f65ee70e1df25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,91,4,85,26,132,195,66,148,212,111,186,49,15,101,238,112,225,223,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
