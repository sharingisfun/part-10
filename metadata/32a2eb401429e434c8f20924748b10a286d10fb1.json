Yes, his redneck tendencies sound a little disturbing to PC-leaning ears, but Coe was a great, unashamed country singer, singing the purest honky-tonk and hardest country of his era, making even Waylon and Willie seem a little conventional. There is an undeniable reactionary streak to his music yet, especially in retrospect, this makes it stronger, since he seems like one of the lone voices fighting for traditional country values. Did he win the fight? Well, in a way, he did, since he created pure, hardcore country, as this set of songs proves. \n  \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.You never even called me [05:16] \n by my name \n 02.Please come to boston [04:20] \n 03.Jody like A melody [03:05] \n 04.Longhaired redneck [03:24] \n 05.If that ain't country [04:51] \n 06.Willie, waylon and me [03:14] \n 07.Take this job and shove it [02:57] \n 08.Just to prove my love for [02:26] \n you \n 09.Jack daniels , if you [03:18] \n please \n 10.Would you lay with me [02:51] \n (in A field of stone) \n 11.Divers do it deeper [03:03] \n 12.X's and o's [03:48] \n (kisses and hugs) \n 13.This bottle (in my hand) [02:52] \n (with george jones) \n 14.Get A little dirt on [03:41] \n (with bill anderson) \n 15.Stand by your man [03:30] \n 16.Tennessee whiskey [03:01] \n 17.Now I lay me down to cheat [03:25] \n 18.What made you change your [02:52] \n mind \n 19.The ride [03:08] \n 20.Mona lisa lost her smile [03:40] \n ____ \n \n 68:42 min \n 99,4 MB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32a2eb401429e434c8f20924748b10a286d10fb1","amp;dn":"David_Allan_Coe-For_The_Record_The_First_10_Years_%28Retail%29-1984-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32a2eb401429e434c8f20924748b10a286d10fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,162,235,64,20,41,228,52,200,242,9,36,116,139,16,162,134,209,15,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
