As long as the people believe Cloak's lies, Alex and his friends are all that stand in the way of total Cloak domination. But to bring Cloak to justice, Alex must make a final stand against his parents, his past, and the life of supervillainy he's always known.\n\nPraised by Publishers Weekly for its &quot;rapid-fire, comic bookÃ¢â‚¬â€œstyle action&quot; and by School Library Journal for having &quot;the same wide appeal as Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson books,&quot; the Cloak Society trilogy delivers high-stakes battles, extraordinary superpowers, and an original twist on the superhero stories readers know and love. Can a villain ever truly become a hero? In this explosive series finale, the stakes are higher than ever - and the answer will be decided once and for all.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade0d9cf462c44f0a2ec4a6a5c8f946d961e4274","amp;dn":"Fall+of+Heroes+The+Cloak+Society+3+%28Jeramey+Kraatz%29+Retail+azw3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade0d9cf462c44f0a2ec4a6a5c8f946d961e4274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,224,217,207,70,44,68,240,162,236,74,106,92,143,148,109,150,30,66,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
