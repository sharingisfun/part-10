Eager to learn our democratic ways, he travels across the 50 states, exploring the ins and outs of our society. His hope? To bring those shining examples of American good will, tolerance, and compromise back to his homeland. Along the way, he discovers that the land of the free and the home of the brave is actually much more a hotbed of corporate-owned politicians, and gun-toting racists. Each of these 10 digital episodes explores a different theme of our troubled democracy, hosted by the man popularly referred to as the Jon Stewart of the Middle East.\r\n\r\n10 Episodes:\r\n\r\nThe Right to Buy Guns\r\nWhy does America love the 2nd Amendment so much?\r\n\r\nChurch Loves State 4Ever\r\nAmericaâ€™s messy relationship between church and state\r\n\r\nRebranding Arabs\r\nA guide for Arabs on how to disintegrate into the great American melting pot\r\n\r\nIf at First You Donâ€™t Secede\r\nHow to start your own country\r\n\r\nPutting Out the UnWelcome Mat\r\nA bold new way to solve Americaâ€™s immigration â€˜problemâ€™\r\n\r\nOne Trump to Rule Them All\r\nHow Trump would be a great leaderâ€”in the Middle East\r\n\r\nThe New Hate Economy\r\nBigotry: The new â€˜niche industryâ€™ with record hate and booming profits\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a Free Speech Country\r\nAmericaâ€™s B-rated, all-you-can-eat free speech buffett\r\n\r\nIs change even possible in America?\r\n\r\nGerrymandering, staging bad press, and fundraisers: Inside the crazy world of elections\r\n\r\n\r\nBy FUSION Comedy \nhttp://fusion.net/series/democracy-handbook/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7703f72440fbee559f438c7ad5fab3f78d848b8","amp;dn":"Democracy+Handbook+with+Bassem+Youssef+2016+Fusion+Webrip+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7703f72440fbee559f438c7ad5fab3f78d848b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,112,63,114,68,15,190,229,89,244,56,199,173,95,171,63,120,216,72,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
