The almost unfathomable scale of his crimesÃ¢â‚¬â€œas many as 20 million Soviets died in his purges and infamous GulagÃ¢â‚¬â€œhas given him the lasting distinction as a personification of evil in the twentieth century. But though the facts of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign are well known, this remarkable biography reveals a Stalin we have never seen before as it illuminates the vast foundationÃ¢â‚¬â€œhuman, psychological and physicalÃ¢â‚¬â€œthat supported and encouraged him, the men and women who did his bidding, lived in fear of him and, more often than not, were betrayed by him.\n\nIn a seamless meshing of exhaustive research, brilliant synthesis and narrative ÃƒÂ©lan, Simon Sebag Montefiore chronicles the life and lives of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s court from the time of his acclamation as Ã¢â‚¬Å“leaderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1929, five years after LeninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, until his own death in 1953 at the age of seventy-three. Through the lens of personalityÃ¢â‚¬â€œStalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as well as those of his most notorious henchmen, Molotov, Beria and Yezhov among themÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe author sheds new light on the oligarchy that attempted to create a new world by exterminating the old. He gives us the details of their quotidian and monstrous lives: StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorites in music, movies, literature (Hemmingway, The Forsyte Saga and The Last of the Mohicans were at the top of his list), food and history (he took Ivan the Terrible as his role model and swore by LeninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dictum, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A revolution without firing squads is meaninglessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). We see him among his courtiers, his informal but deadly game of power played out at dinners and parties at Black Sea villas and in the apartments of the Kremlin. We see the debauchery, paranoia and cravenness that ruled the lives of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner court, and we see how the dictator played them one against the other in order to hone the awful efficiency of his killing machine.\n\nWith stunning attention to detail, Montefiore documents the crimes, small and large, of all the members of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s court. And he traces the intricate and shifting web of their relationships as the relative warmth of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule in the early 1930s gives way to the Great Terror of the late 1930s, the upheaval of World War II (there has never been as acute an account of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meeting at Yalta with Churchill and Roosevelt) and the horrific postwar years when he terrorized his closest associates as unrelentingly as he did the rest of his country.\n\nStalin: The Court of the Red Tsar gives an unprecedented understanding of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dictatorship, and, as well, a Stalin as human and complicated as he is brutal. It is a galvanizing portrait: razor-sharp, sensitive and unforgiving.\n\n848 pages\nPublisher: Vintage; Reprint edition (September 13, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1400076781\nISBN-13: 978-1400076789","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74ea1644fdef1d17693dd019e5b7dfe19870edfe","amp;dn":"Stalin%3A+Court+of+the+Red+Tsar+by+Simon+Sebag+Montefiore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74ea1644fdef1d17693dd019e5b7dfe19870edfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,234,22,68,253,239,29,23,105,61,208,25,229,183,223,225,152,112,237,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
