Like most bands of their era, the Kinks began as an R&amp;B/blues outfit. Within four years, the band had become the most staunchly English of all their contemporaries, drawing heavily from British music hall and traditional pop, as well as incorporating elements of country, folk, and blues. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifoxqe5ldse~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifoxqe5ldse~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlbum Review:\n\nSince the mid-'70s, the Kinks have not been able to stop themselves from attempting their own variations on pop music trends, taking stabs at everything from bombastic heavy metal to sleek disco-flavored pop. On To the Bone, the group became another one of the scores of veteran rock acts to record an acoustic, &quot;unplugged&quot; album. However, the group's American popularity was at an all-time low in the mid-'90s and the band wasn't able to score a major-label record deal (at least, not at the time of its original release), let alone land a spot on MTV's prime-time ratings bonanza, Unplugged. So, the group financed their acoustic greatest-hits record To the Bone themselves, releasing it on the U.K. independent label Grapevine. Naturally, Ray Davies' songs work well in such a stripped-back setting, but the album is nothing more than a pleasant diversion, featuring a lovely version of &quot;Waterloo Sunset,&quot; possibly the most beautiful song of the rock &amp; roll era. [The American version of To the Bone, released over a year later on Capitol's Guardian subsidiary, is a double-disc set.]\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wjftxqrkldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wjftxqrkldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-&gt; Note that the US version does not have Waterloo Sunset!\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
