The rhythm section went through several changes, with drummer John Ike Walton and bass player Ronnie Leatherman being the longest permanent members. Hall was the band's primary lyricist and philosopher, with Sutherland and Erickson both contributing lyrics as well as writing and arranging the group's music. Along with Erickson's powerful vocals, Hall's &quot;electric jug&quot; became the band's signature sound in the early days. In July 1967, Walton and Leatherman left the band and were replaced by Danny Thomas (drums) and Dan Galindo (bass). Ronnie Leatherman later returned for the third and final studio album, Bull of the Woods.\n\nThe 13th Floor Elevators-Bull Of The Woods\n\nThe 13th Floor Elevators-Easter Everywhere-1967\n\nThe Psychedelic World Of The 13th Floor Elevators [UK] Disc 1\n\nThe Psychedelic World Of The 13th Floor Elevators [UK] Disc 2\n\nThe Psychedelic World Of The 13th Floor Elevators [UK] Disc 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03a239846bdecf03afb56a2ccf76369e08e9ea1a","amp;dn":"The+13th+Floor+Elevators+5+cds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03a239846bdecf03afb56a2ccf76369e08e9ea1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,162,57,132,107,222,207,3,175,181,106,44,207,118,54,158,8,233,234,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
