While other scandals involve money, Fast and Furious involves lives, including that of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, gunned down with a weapon that the federal government put in the hands of MexicoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narco-terrorists.\n\nAs shocking as Operation Fast and Furious wasÃ¢â‚¬â€and this book explains, in chilling detail, just what this operation conducted by the ATF, under the supervision of the Justice Department, entailedÃ¢â‚¬â€equally appalling is the blatant cover-up of wrongdoing by the Obama administration. No reporter has been more dogged in tracking down the facts about Fast and Furious than Katie Pavlich. In her stunning new book she reveals:\n\n-The documents that undermine the White HouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s claims of ignorance about Fast and Furious\n-How Eric Holder, President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attorney general, has, under oath, repeatedly changed his testimony\n-The still mounting death toll from Fast and Furious\n-The retaliation against Fast and Furious whistleblowers\n-Why Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano might be charged with perjury\n-The Obama administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing assault on Second Amendment rights\n-Why Fast and Furious could be a bigger scandal than Watergate\n\nUnraveling the mystery of what Fast and Furious was all about, Katie Pavlich delivers a stunning indictment of a radical administration willing to trample the Constitution and risk lives to achieve its ideological goals.\n\n224 pages\nPublisher: Regnery Publishing (April 16, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1596983213\nASIN: B00AZ8TX2I","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9aacb43a6aeff103850ec5a3bec1541e5137dbf","amp;dn":"Fast+and+Furious%3A+Obama%27s+Scandal+%282012%29+by+Katie+Pavlich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9aacb43a6aeff103850ec5a3bec1541e5137dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,170,203,67,166,174,255,16,56,80,236,90,59,236,21,65,229,19,125,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
