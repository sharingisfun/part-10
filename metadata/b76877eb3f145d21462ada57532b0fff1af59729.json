In the not-too-distant past, humans shared this planet with other species of hominid. This series tells how, against all the odds, Homo sapiens survived.\n\nPart 2: Neanderthal\nThis episode is set 35,000 years ago and depicts Homo sapiens's encounter with Homo neanderthalensis. As the ice caps retreated, the Neanderthal stronghold in Europe weakened, providing a window of opportunity to which modern humans owe their existence. As almost exclusively carnivorous, both male and female Neanderthals hunted. Evidence of a huge number of injuries, like those seen in today's rodeo riders, suggest that hunting involved dangerously close contact with large prey animals.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b76877eb3f145d21462ada57532b0fff1af59729","amp;dn":"Planet+of+the+Apemen%3A+Battle+for+Earth+Part+2+Neanderthal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b76877eb3f145d21462ada57532b0fff1af59729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,104,119,235,63,20,93,33,70,42,218,87,83,43,15,255,26,245,151,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
