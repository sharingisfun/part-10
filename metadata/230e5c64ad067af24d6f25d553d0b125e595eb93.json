This is the inevitable side effect of time, when an album that is decades old enters the history books, but this isn't an album that should be preserved in amber, seen only as an important record. Because this is a record that is exploding with life, a record with so much energy, it doesn't sound old","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230e5c64ad067af24d6f25d553d0b125e595eb93","amp;dn":"MAGIC+SAM+-+West+Side+Soul+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230e5c64ad067af24d6f25d553d0b125e595eb93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,14,92,100,173,6,122,242,77,111,37,213,83,208,177,37,229,149,235,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
