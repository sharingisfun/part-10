My original CD stopped working and we all know about the quality of Activisions costumer service. So I decided to get it as a torrent and share it here.\n\nPlease keep sharing it and, there for keep it alive. \n\nI got all Civilization titles from 1 to 5 and I still prefer this one because Call to Power 2 is the only Civ that actually plays out into a possible future and enables inventions and technologies which don't exist in our real world yet.\nIt has the most types of units you can get and it is still the most complex Civ title ever developed, even though the graphics look ancient compared to the new Civ4 and Civ5.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThis image should work just fine with virtual CD/DVD emulation ( Alcohol, cloneCD/DVD, Deamon Tools)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:367d9d86d93a18eba73de6a336e2531ed905a02f","amp;dn":"Call_to_Power_II+%282%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"367d9d86d93a18eba73de6a336e2531ed905a02f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,125,157,134,217,58,24,235,167,61,230,163,54,226,83,30,217,5,160,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
