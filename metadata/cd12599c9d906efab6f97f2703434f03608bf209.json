They have become icons of the 80s MTV era and have had widespread commercial success. To date, the band has sold more than 25 million records worldwide,[citation needed] including 18.5 million in the United States alone.[1] The band has also charted ten singles to the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, including six Top 10 singles and one #1.[2] After 25 years, the band is still recording music and performing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock 2006\n\n\n\n\nThe Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock is a compilation album from the American rock band Poison, released to celebrate the band's 20 year anniversary. It has sold more than 697,063 copies to date in the U.S as of June 2009.\n\nThe album was released on April 3, 2006 on EMI. It features many songs from the band's 20-year career. Most notable is the song &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot;, which was the band's biggest hit, a power ballad. A rare cover of the KISS classic &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; appears, previously only available on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Less Than Zero&quot;. The compilation also includes a new single, the Grand Funk Railroad roadie classic &quot;We're an American Band&quot;, which also features a music video.\n\nThe album was produced by Don Was and marked Poison's return to the Billboard 200 top 20 charts for the first time since 1993. The compilation debuted at #17[1], quite an impressive showing for a hair metal band in 2006, and perhaps showing the beneficial effect of many Behind the Music-type shows on VH1, where Poison's hair metal antics were relived.\n\nThe cover art is taken from the book Pornography: Opposing Viewpoints.[2]\n\nA special edition has been released that includes a bonus greatest hits DVD compilation. The DVD includes the new video We're An American Band.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot; \n2.\t&quot;I Want Action&quot; (single version) \n3.\t&quot;I Won't Forget You&quot; (single version) \n4.\t&quot;Cry Tough&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Look What The Cat Dragged In&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Nothin' But a Good Time&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Your Mama Don't Dance&quot; (originally performed by Loggins and Messina) \n10.\t&quot;Unskinny Bop&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; (originally performed by KISS) \n12.\t&quot;Ride the Wind&quot; \n13.\t&quot;Something to Believe In&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Life Goes On&quot; \n15.\t&quot;Stand&quot; \n16.\t&quot;The Last Song&quot; \n17.\t&quot;Shooting Star&quot; \n18.\t&quot;We're An American Band&quot; (originally performed by Grand Funk Railroad) (New Single for the Album) \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd12599c9d906efab6f97f2703434f03608bf209","amp;dn":"Poison+-+Best+of+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2006+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd12599c9d906efab6f97f2703434f03608bf209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,18,89,156,157,144,110,250,182,249,127,39,3,67,79,3,96,139,242,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
