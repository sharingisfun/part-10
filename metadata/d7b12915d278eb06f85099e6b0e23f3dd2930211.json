He has recorded a number of albums released on Southern Records, and now is a member of the Anti Records family. His act consists mostly of playing the banjo or guitar while singing, though on occasion he performs a cappella. While he has earned much acclaim from the folk, blues and alt-country communities, he is also rooted in the hardcore punk community, by paying, for example, a homage for the worldwide spread icon of Bad Religion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7b12915d278eb06f85099e6b0e23f3dd2930211","amp;dn":"William+Elliot+Whitmore+-+Song+of+the+blackbird+%282006%29+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7b12915d278eb06f85099e6b0e23f3dd2930211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,177,41,21,210,120,235,6,248,80,153,230,176,226,63,61,210,147,2,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
