But even before the League had its current, world-shaking lineup, the team was always a powerful force against evil, and in &quot;JLA: Year One&quot; the clock is turned back in an all-new tale of the League that was! Comprising the Martian Manhunter, Black Canary, Aquaman, Flash and Green Lantern are joined by Batman and Superman to face down threats both terrestrial and otherwise! Fan-favourite creators Mark Waid (&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;), Brian Augustyn (&quot;Crimson&quot;) and Barry Kitson (&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;) capture the spirit of the original JLA in a style as modern as it is classic.&quot;\n\nThese brand new digital copies are courtesy of Cypher-Empire.
