One of those how-did-they-do-that videos i.e.the band coughs up lots of money to help pay for new effects experiments that the advertising industry will make a fortune using. 4.The Great Beyond.A film tie-in promo that actually moves you.Unheard of until this.The film and song are about Andy Kaufman and it works beautifully.Not just a movie advert with music. 5.At My Most Beautiful.Another lovely song.But I was a bit distracted by the clumsy cellist having a rubbish day on the way to her audition. 6.Daysleeper.The set-list should have been moved about a bit as the songs in this segment are frankly, very similar in mood.A great song about working night-shifts but I found myself wanting to jump around to something idiotic like,say...Shiny Happy People. 7.Electolite.Another downbeat but moving song but this is helped by the band being silly in the video.Hurrah. 8.E-Bow the Letter.Moody promo to a moody song.A personal favourite with goddess Patti Smith mooching around Prague,singing as only she can ,a duet with Mr.Stipe.A bedsit classic. 9.What&amp;#039;s The Frequency Kenneth? Suddenly Peter Buck is prodded into life and guitars are switched ON and I remembered that REM have one the most talented guitarists in the world.This ode to stalked newscasters is a classic.In the video though, Mr.Stipe came to terms with the onset of baldness by being filmed from the neck down only. 10.Nightswimming.A black and white promo of naked people swimmimg.At night. 11.The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite.More black and white, but with humour. 12.Everybody Hurts.Quite simply one of the greatest songs ever written.The video is not subtle put it packs a punch.All you can do is cry like a baby. 13.Man on the Moon.More shots of Andy Kaufman.The song that inspired the film that they then sung the theme song for .Mr.Stipe does a good Elvis impression, though. 14.Losing My Religion.Another genuine classic song.The promo though is a little on the very pretentious side.The band are surrounded by classical figures doing silly classical things like holding apples for no apparent reason. 15.Stand.A poppy silly song, probably ironic to. In fact it&amp;#039;s not unlike Shiny Happy People but minus the embarrassment. 16.Orange Crush.Another classic.With guitars.The video is another black and white one but with a Vietnam vibe.\n\nThe Extras: All great songs from the last few albums but with unbelievably bad videos. Live classics from Trafalger Square,London.\n\nIf you are a fan of REM this is a must have.\n\nFormat: Colour, Dolby Digital 5.1, PAL \nLanguage: English \nRegion: All \nNumber of discs: 1 \nStudio: Warner Bros\nDVD Release Date: 2003 \nRun Time: 96 mins \nDVD Features: \nTracklisting: \n\n01. &quot;Bad Day&quot;\n02. &quot;All The Way To Reno&quot;\n03. &quot;Imitation Of Life&quot;\n04. &quot;The Great Beyond&quot;\n05. &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot;\n06. &quot;Daysleeper&quot;\n07. &quot;Electrolite&quot;\n08. &quot;E-Bow The Letter&quot;\n09. &quot;What&amp;#039;s The Frequancy, Kenneth?&quot;\n10. &quot;Nightswimming&quot;\n11. &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;\n12. &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;\n13. &quot;Man On The Moon&quot;\n14. &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;\n15. &quot;Stand&quot;\n16. &quot;Orange Crush&quot; \n\nBonus Videos: \n17. &quot;Tongue&quot;\n18. &quot;How The West Was Won And Where It Got Us&quot;\n19. &quot;New Test Leper&quot;\n20. &quot;Bittersweet Me&quot;\n21. &quot;Lotus&quot;\n22. &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Take The Rain&quot; \n\nLive-Videos: \n23. &quot;Imitation Of Life&quot;\n24. &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;\n25. &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; \n\nEnjoy all and share it !!!! \n\n***************************************** \n\nEspaÃƒÂ±ol: \n\nIn View es una coleccio?n de videos cla?sicos de una banda que siempre ha sabido coquetear entre lo alternativo y el pop, \ny a la vez entregar producciones visuales inolvidables. Desde Orange Crush hasta All the Way to Reno, he aqui? todo lo que un \nfana?tico atesora y recuerda. \n\nLa versiÃƒÂ³n DVD del primer compilado oficial de R.E.M. cumple con el objetivo de mostrar lo mejor del trabajo audiovisual de la banda. Estamos ante una de las agrupaciones mÃƒÂ¡s importantes de la historia del rock; la excÃƒÂ©ntrica e interesante personalidad de Stipe mÃƒÂ¡s la calidad musical del resto de la banda deja claro que no se trata de cualquier mÃƒÂºsica. Su sonido pop-rock-alternativo, mÃƒÂ¡s la lÃƒÂ­rica de las composiciones, destacÃƒÂ³ siempre y difÃƒÂ­cil era expresar toda esa furia, estilo y filosofÃƒÂ­a social en clips, pero no queda nadie indiferente con las mÃƒÂ¡gicas escenas de videos como Everybody Hurts, Losing My Religion, o las increÃƒÂ­bles Imitation of Life u Orange Crush. En la mÃƒÂºsica hay un tÃƒÂ­tulo de honor, y son los temas que yo clasifico como piezas fundamentales, R.E.M tiene varios.\n\nConcierto con los temas: \n01. &quot;Bad Day&quot;\n02. &quot;All The Way To Reno&quot;\n03. &quot;Imitation Of Life&quot;\n04. &quot;The Great Beyond&quot;\n05. &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot;\n06. &quot;Daysleeper&quot;\n07. &quot;Electrolite&quot;\n08. &quot;E-Bow The Letter&quot;\n09. &quot;What&amp;#039;s The Frequancy, Kenneth?&quot;\n10. &quot;Nightswimming&quot;\n11. &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;\n12. &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;\n13. &quot;Man On The Moon&quot;\n14. &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;\n15. &quot;Stand&quot;\n16. &quot;Orange Crush&quot; \n\nBonus Videos: \n17. &quot;Tongue&quot;\n18. &quot;How The West Was Won And Where It Got Us&quot;\n19. &quot;New Test Leper&quot;\n20. &quot;Bittersweet Me&quot;\n21. &quot;Lotus&quot;\n22. &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Take The Rain&quot; \n\nLive-Videos: \n23. &quot;Imitation Of Life&quot;\n24. &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;\n25. &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; \n\nDisfrutad y no olvideis de compartir !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6b9a879e455d6bcbef0b06169bb13b9ab47e806","amp;dn":"REM%3A+The+Best+of+REM+-+In+View+1988-2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6b9a879e455d6bcbef0b06169bb13b9ab47e806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,185,168,121,228,85,214,188,190,240,176,97,105,187,19,185,171,71,232,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
