Simmons\nJohn WilÃÂµÃ‘Æ’ &amp; Sons | 2005 | ISBN: 0471790184 9780471790181 047173876X 9780471738763 | 448 pages | PDF | 9 MB\n\nInvestment banker Simmons offers a detailed description of the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the U.S and our long-standing dependence upon Saudi oil. With a field-by-field assessment of its key oilfields, author highlights many discrepancies between Saudi Arabia's actual production potential and its seemingly extravagant resource claims.\n\nParts 1 and 2 of the book offer background and context for understanding the technical discussion of Saudi oil fields and the world's energy supplies.\nParts 3 and 4 contain analysis of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas industry based on the technical papers published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\nSimmons suggests that when Saudi Arabia and other Middle East producers can no longer meet the world's enormous demand, world leaders and energy specialists must be prepared for the consequences of increased scarcity and higher costs of oil that support our modern society.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:059d8860a4f40b67c403eff9bf0f98c11bb55958","amp;dn":"Twilight+in+the+Desert%3A+The+Coming+Saudi+Oil+Shock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"059d8860a4f40b67c403eff9bf0f98c11bb55958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,157,136,96,164,244,11,103,196,3,239,249,191,15,152,193,27,181,89,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
