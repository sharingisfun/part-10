They are signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Wannabe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; in 1996. The song hit number-one in 31 countries and helped establish the group as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;global phenomenon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. Credited for being the pioneers that paved the way for the commercial breakthrough of teen pop in the late 1990s, their debut album, Spice, sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in music history. They have sold over 75 million records worldwide with only four albums and twelve singles, making them the best selling girl group of all time. Measures of their success include international record sales, a 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008 reunion tour, merchandising, record-breaking achievements, iconic symbolism such as the Union Flag dress, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Girl Power\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, a box office hit film Spice World and their nicknames.Background information\nOrigin.: London, England\nGenres.: Pop, dance-pop, teen pop\nYears active.: 1994ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2000,2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008\nLabels.: Virgin\nOfficial Site\nSpice Girls @ Wikipedia\n\nAlbums:\n[1996] - Spice\n[1997] - Spiceworld\n[2000] - Forever\n[2007] - Greatest Hits (3CD Deluxe Edition)\n\nSingles (320 kbps):\n[1996] - Wannabe (UK CD1)\n[1996] - Wannabe (UK CD2)\n[1996] - Say You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll Be There (UK CD1)\n[1996] - Say You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll Be There (UK CD2)\n[1996] - 2 Become 1 (UK CD1)\n[1996] - 2 Become 1 (UK CD2)\n[1997] - Mama - Who Do You Think You Are (UK CD)\n[1997] - Who Do You Think You Are - Mama (UK CD)\n[1997] - Step To Me (UK CD)\n[1997] - Spice Up Your Life (UK CD1)\n[1997] - Spice Up Your Life (UK CD2)\n[1997] - Too Much (UK CD1)\n[1997] - Too Much (UK CD2)\n[1997] - Move Over (Generation Next) (Live)\n[1998] - Stop (UK CD1)\n[1998] - Stop (UK CD2)\n[1998] - Viva Forever (UK CD1)\n[1998] - Viva Forever (UK CD2)\n[1998] - Goodbye (UK CD1)\n[1998] - Goodbye (UK CD2)\n[2000] - Holler-Let Love Lead The Way (UK CD)\n[2000] - Let Love Lead The Way-Holler (UK CD)\n[2007] - Headlines (Friendship Never Ends) (digital)\n[2007] - Headlines (Friendship Never Ends) (UK CD)\n\nAgain remixes nevoshedshih in cd-singles (128-320 kbps):\n[1996] - Wannabe (Remixes Pack)\n[1996] - Say You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll Be There (Remixes Pack)\n[1996] - 2 Become 1 (Remixes Pack)\n[1997] - Who Do You Think You Are (Remixes Pack)\n[1997] - Spice Up Your Life (Remixes Pack)\n[1997] - Stop (Remixes Pack)\n[1998] - Viva Forever (Remixes Pack)\n[1998] - Goodbye (Remixes Pack)\n[2000] - Holler (Remixes Pack)\n[2001] - Tell Me Why (Remixes Pack)\n\nPromo CDs (128-320 kbps):\n[1997] - Can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t Stay Tonight (Promo CD)\n[1998] - Viva Forever-Never Give Up On The Good Times (Promo)\n[2000] - Forever (German Promo Sampler)\n[2001] - If You Wanna Have Some Fun\n[2007] - Club Remixes\n[2007] - Official Megamix\n\nRare (128-320 kbps):\n[1994] - Raw Spice\n[1997] - Spiceworld The Video Game\n[1998] - Spiceworld The Movie Songs\n[1998] - On Top Of The World (single)\n[1999] - Spice Girls &amp; Girl Power (Interview)\n[1999] - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Only Rock \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Roll (But I Like It) (single)\n[2000] - Karaoke Video Collection\n[2008] - Return Of The Spice Girls Studio Demos (Unreleased)\nFanmade Instrumentals (Unofficial)\nHere Comes The Spice Squirrels (Unofficial Funny Bootleg)\nKaraoke Classics (Unofficial)\nOther\n\nLive (128-192 kbps):\n[1997] - Girl Power!
