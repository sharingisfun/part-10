No other single work exists which reviews this important identification process from beginning to end. We examine the identification process for latent (crime scene) prints and how they are identified with these systems. While the primary focus is automated fingerprint identifications, the book also touches on the emergence and use of fingerprints in other biometric systems.\n\nCriminal justice administrators, policy makers, and students of forensic science and criminal justice will find a reference to the known limitations and advantages of these systems.\n\nThis book provides information as to the critical and continual need for properly trained individuals as well as an understanding of the direct and indirect costs associated with maintaining these systems.\n\nAn understanding of the entire system and what it means will prove invaluable. Why are there missed identifications? Why are identifications made on one database that are not made on another database? Key terms and issues are included, and well as suggestions for improving the overall number of identifications.\n\nThe book will go beyond process and also discuss issues such as interoperability, management strategies for large databases, contract development, lights out verification and several other issues which impact automated identifications.&quot;\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:219f0923c64fa0ac6a2be013e74724f9c232f80e","amp;dn":"Automated+Fingerprint+Identification+Systems+%28AFIS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"219f0923c64fa0ac6a2be013e74724f9c232f80e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,159,9,35,198,79,160,172,106,43,224,19,231,71,36,249,194,50,248,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
