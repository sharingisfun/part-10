The second of three children born to the Reverend Marvin Gay, Sr., an ordained minister in the House of God -- a conservative Christian sect that fuses elements of orthodox Judaism and Pentecostalism, imposes strict codes of conduct, and observes no holidays -- he began singing in church at the age of three, quickly becoming a soloist in the choir. Gaye later took up piano and drums, and music became his escape from the nightmarish realities of his home life -- throughout his childhood, his father beat him on an almost daily basis.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac (Level 8)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tMotown\nCatalog:\t\t37463-6310-2\nOriginal Release:\t1978\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n\n01.Here, My Dear\n02.I Met A Little Girl\n03.When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You\n04.Anger\n05.Is That Enough\n06.Everybody Needs Love\n07.Time To Get It Together\n08.Sparrow\n09.Anna's Song\n10.When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You (Instrumental)\n11.A Funky Space Reincarnation\n12.You Can Leave, But It's Going To Cost You\n13.Falling In Love Again\n14.When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You (Reprise)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3bc92183747ff65e388d4d4b94790e024728e3","amp;dn":"Marvin+Gaye+-+Here%2C+My+Dear+%281978%2F1993%29+%5BEAC.FLAC.LOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3bc92183747ff65e388d4d4b94790e024728e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,59,201,33,131,116,127,246,94,56,141,77,75,148,121,14,2,71,40,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
