The Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual projects. Trower then joined new band Procol Harum in 1967, and where he remained until 1972. After going solo in 1973, he found the individual identity and style that have brought him acclaim to this day.\n\nDisc 1:\n1. Daydream\n2. Sinner&amp;#039;s Song\n3. Twice Removed From Yesterday\n4.
