In this course, Joseph Lowery tackles Dreamweaver CC 2014, built with a new underlying engine and extended features. To start, Joe reviews the new Extract panel, which allows you to pull CSS, images, and text directly from Photoshop files. He then explores improvements in Live view, which can now be used to drag and drop HTML elements, assets, URLs, and even color values from one layout to another. Check back often for updates. New chapters will be added each time Adobe releases a major Dreamweaver CC update","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b888802c360d0d93aae62058da0903f727e1fb70","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Dreamweaver%3A+2014+Creative+Cloud+Updates+with+Joseph+Low","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b888802c360d0d93aae62058da0903f727e1fb70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,136,128,44,54,13,13,147,170,230,32,88,218,9,3,247,39,225,251,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
