He's a fast and flashy player whose approach rests equally on technical assurance and musical intelligence. Sizing up a dozen songs, he gets a pleasing, razor-sharp sound out of his ax while building excitement in his lead lines--thankfully, he steers clear of clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and bombast. As a fledging singer, he acts out the lyrics of Ike Turner's age-old shuffle &quot;Matchbox&quot; and his own romantic ballad &quot;Missing Your Love&quot; with surprising poise and believability. Kudos to producer David Z for surrounding Lang with alert, first-rate sidemen and for helping select good material from Turner, Sonny Boy Williamson, Tinsley Ellis, and others. --Frank-John Hadley.\n\n1  &quot;Lie To Me&quot; (Bruce McCabe/David Z) - 4:11 \n2 &quot;Darker Side&quot; (Bruce McCabe) - 5:07 \n3 &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; (Sonny Boy Williamson I) - 4:15 \n4 &quot;Still Wonder&quot; (Kevin Bowe) - 3:45 \n5 &quot;Matchbox&quot; (Ike Turner) - 3:29 \n6 &quot;Back For A Taste Of Your Love&quot; (Syl Johnson/Darrly Carter/Brenda Johnson) - 3:32 \n7 &quot;A Quitter Never Wins&quot; (Tinsley Ellis/Margaret Simpson) - 5:56 \n8 &quot;Hit The Ground Running&quot; (Michael Lunn/Jeff Silbar) - 3:31 \n9 &quot;Rack 'Em Up&quot; (Bruce McCabe) - 4:07 \n10 &quot;When I Come To You&quot; (Jonny Lang/Dennis Morgan) - 4:58 \n11 &quot;There's Gotta Be A Change&quot; (Gwendolyn Collins) - 4:11 \n12 &quot;Missing Your Love&quot; (Jonny Lang/Dennis Morgan) - 3:53 \n\nFormat Wav\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1b89a48c99f26181610fe9079aaeea9bde46687","amp;dn":"Jonny+Lang+-+Lie+To+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1b89a48c99f26181610fe9079aaeea9bde46687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,184,154,72,201,159,38,24,22,16,254,144,121,170,238,169,189,228,102,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
