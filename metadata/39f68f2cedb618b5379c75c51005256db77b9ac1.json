Again employing a host of experimental devices that would inspire a whole new generation of writers to follow, Dos Passos captures the many textures, flavors, and background noises of modern life with a cinematic touch and unparalleled nerve.\n\nThe novel opens to find America and the world at war, and Dos Passos's characters, many of whom we met in the first volume, are thrown into the snarl. We follow the daughter of a Chicago minister, a wide-eyed Texas girl, a young poet, and a radical Jew, and we glimpse Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and the Unknown Soldier.\n\n\n________\n\nThe Big Money (UNABRIDGED)\nby John Dos Passos \nNarrated by David Drummond\n\nLENGTH: 19 hrs and 29 mins\nAUDIBLE RELEASE DATE: 01-10-11\nPUBLISHER: Tantor Audio\n\nPublisher's Summary\nThe Big Money completes John Dos Passos's three-volume &quot;fable of America's materialistic success and moral decline&quot; (American Heritage) and marks the end of &quot;one of the most ambitious projects that an American novelist has ever undertaken&quot; (Time).\n\nHere, we come back to America after the war and find a nation on the upswing. Industrialism booms. The stock market surges. Lindbergh takes his solo flight. Henry Ford makes automobiles. From New York to Hollywood, love affairs to business deals, it is a country taking the turns too fast, speeding toward the crash of 1929.\n\nUltimately, the novels of the U.S.A. trilogy - both individually and as a whole - paint a sweeping portrait of collective America and showcase the brilliance and bravery of one of its most enduring and admired writers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f68f2cedb618b5379c75c51005256db77b9ac1","amp;dn":"U.S.A.+Trilogy+by+John+Dos+Passos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f68f2cedb618b5379c75c51005256db77b9ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,246,143,44,237,182,24,181,55,156,117,197,16,5,37,109,183,123,154,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
