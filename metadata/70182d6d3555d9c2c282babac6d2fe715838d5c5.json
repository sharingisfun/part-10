Children of divorced parents, the two grew up    \n          separately in Florida. Simon studied chemistry at the University of Florida, then    \n          received a scholarship to Polytechnic in Brooklyn. There, he was joined by his       \n          brother; the two claim to have financed their demos by selling drugs. Raiding other  \n          bands for lead guitarist Tripp Eisen, bass player Acey Slade, and drummer Preston    \n          Nash, they began a selective series of gigs in late 1997. In October 1998, they were \n          signed to Flip Records, which made a production deal with Epic. Dope's debut album,  \n          Felons and Revolutionaries, was released in September 1999. The Dope brothers gutted \n          their lineup after the ensuing tour, switching Slade to guitar and bringing in       \n          original bassist Sloane Jentry, guitarist Virus and drummer Sketchy Shay. In the fall\n          of 2001, they released their second album, Life. Two years later, the band inked a   \n          deal with Artemis, and issued Group Therapy. American Apathy arrived in summer 2005. \n          ~ William Ruhlmann, All Music Guide                                                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Flatline                    [00:38]                                        \n                 02.6-6-sick                    [02:48]                                        \n                 03.Addiction                   [02:43]                                        \n                 04.No regrets                  [03:31]                                        \n                 05.My funeral                  [03:26]                                        \n                 06.We are                      [03:26]                                        \n                 07.Dirty world                 [03:01]                                        \n                 08.Interlude                   [00:09]                                        \n                 09.Violence                    [02:52]                                        \n                 10.Best for me                 [03:21]                                        \n                 11.Bloodless                   [00:11]                                        \n                 12.Scorn                       [03:04]                                        \n                 13.Rebell yell                 [04:05]                                        \n                 14.I don't give A ...
