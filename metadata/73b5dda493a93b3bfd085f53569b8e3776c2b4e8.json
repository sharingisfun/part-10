They are currently hunted by humans, who do not want to go through trouble again. When Cade (Mark Wahlberg) finds an abandoned truck, he could never imagine that the vehicle is actually Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader. Much less than by helping to bring it back to life, Cade and his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) enter in the crosshairs of US authorities.\n\nTitle in Brazil: Transformers - The Age of Extinction\nOriginal title: Transformers: Age of Extinction\nYear of Production: 2014\nRelease Year in Brazil: 2014\nGenre: Action\nDuration: 165 minutes\nDirector: Michael Bay\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2109248/\n\nSize: 4.36 GB\nFile Extension: .ISO\nVideo Quality: DVD-R\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nAudio Codec: AC3\nResolution: 853 x 480\nAudio Language: Portuguese / English\nSubtitles: Portuguese\n\n\nSEED PLEASE\n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73b5dda493a93b3bfd085f53569b8e3776c2b4e8","amp;dn":"Transformers+Age+of+Extinction+2014+DVDR+R4+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73b5dda493a93b3bfd085f53569b8e3776c2b4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,181,221,164,147,169,59,59,253,8,95,83,86,155,142,55,118,194,180,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
