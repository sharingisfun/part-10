Though the self-conscious sprawl of the album might appear self-indulgent on the surface, Daydream Nation is powered by a sustained vision, one that encapsulates all of the group's quirks and strengths. Alternating between tense, hypnotic instrumental passages and furious noise explosions, the music demonstrates a range of emotions and textures, and in many ways, it's hard not to listen to the record as one long piece of shifting dynamics. But the songs themselves are remarkable, from the anti-anthem of &quot;Teen Age Riot&quot; and the punky &quot;Silver Rocket&quot; to the hazy drug dreams of &quot;Providence&quot; and the rolling waves of &quot;Eric's Trip.&quot; Daydream Nation  demonstrates the extent to which noise and self-conscious avant art can be incorporated into rock, and the results are nothing short of stunning. \n\nfrom http://en.wikipedia.org):\n\nIn the years following its release, Daydream Nation has risen in stature to become one of the most highly-regarded albums of the 1980s, receiving much critical acclaim and appearing on many &quot;Best-of&quot; lists. It was ranked #1 on Pitchfork Media's &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&quot;, #14 on Spin's &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005&quot; and #45 on Rolling Stone magazine's &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 329 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2006, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n===================================================================================\n\nPosted several times at TPB but not in FLAC:\nThis is the 2007 double-CD reissue from the original studio album plus one disc with corresponding live recordings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:549fcdb3f543ed9ff459da3b883b1a0adf7e8eae","amp;dn":"Sonic+Youth+-+1988+-+Daydream+Nation+%282CD+deluxe+edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"549fcdb3f543ed9ff459da3b883b1a0adf7e8eae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,159,205,179,245,67,237,159,244,89,218,59,136,59,26,10,223,126,142,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
