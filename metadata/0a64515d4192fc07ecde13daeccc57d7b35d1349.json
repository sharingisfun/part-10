Barry puts his genius to work primarily in creating outlandish inventions that are centuries ahead of their time, such as teleportation devices, jetpacks and wallet-sized nuclear devices. Many of the storylines involve one of Barry's inventions going horribly wrong (usually due to Jeremy's clumsiness) and the two boys' efforts to right the situation before anyone can find out. Barry takes great care to keep his genius a secret and maintains Jeremy as his only confidant. The pair's dialogue is rife with profanity, often complex in its construction, and this foul-mouthed irreverence is reflected to a lesser extent in several of the other characters.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a64515d4192fc07ecde13daeccc57d7b35d1349","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Barry+Ween%2C+Boy+Genius+%5BADULT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a64515d4192fc07ecde13daeccc57d7b35d1349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,100,81,93,65,146,252,7,236,222,19,218,236,204,87,215,179,93,19,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
