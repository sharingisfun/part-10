Their second series was published by Image Comics. Currently their titles are self-published.\n\nGary Carlson's first major independent comic occurred in the 1980s with a black and white title called Megaton. Erik Larsen's Savage Dragon, Rob Liefeld's Youngblood both debuted in Megaton. In the 1990s Carlson wrote Berzerker for Caliber Press; one of the first canonical appearances of a Big Bang Comics character was by the Knight Watchman in Berzerker #1. Gary co-created the Big Bang anthology series alongside artist and writer Chris Ecker.\nUntil 2005, Big Bang published 35 issues of Big Bang through Image Comics, followed by seven &quot;special&quot; comics.\n\nThe company is currently self-publishing Big Bang Presents. Like its predecessors published through Caliber and Image, this is an anthology series featuring a rotating cast of new and established characters in the Big Bang universe, written by Carlson and drawn by Ecker and various other artists\n\nSome of the iconic characters in the Big Bang Universe include:\n\nThe Beacon \nDr. Weird \nKnight Watchman \nProtoplasman \nThunder Girl \nUltiman  \n\nSuperhero teams in the Big Bang Universe include the Round Table of America, the Knights of Justice, the Pantheon of Heroes, and the Whiz Kids.\n\nI will not share my personal thoughts as to the comics contained in this torrent aside from the fact that this is what I consider to be one of the true anomalies of American pop-culture.\n\nThanks to the scanners and to the original sources.\n\nPlease seed.
