ChekhovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singular ability to speak volumes with a single, impeccably chosen word, mesh comedy and pathos, and capture lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic sadness as he entertains us, are why so many aspire to emulate him. How to Write Like Chekhov meticulously cherry-picks from ChekhovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plays, stories, and letters to his publisher, brother, and friends, offering suggestions and observations on subjects including plot and characters (and their names), descriptions and dialogue, and what to emphasise and avoid. This is a uniquely clear roadmap to ChekhovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intelligence and artistic expertise and an essential addition to the writing-guide shelf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0086ea0279919d6fa525e85ab7c9c850a0556b1","amp;dn":"Anton+Chekhov+-+How+to+Write+Like+Chekhov+%28253p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0086ea0279919d6fa525e85ab7c9c850a0556b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,8,110,160,39,153,25,214,250,82,94,133,171,124,156,133,10,5,86,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
