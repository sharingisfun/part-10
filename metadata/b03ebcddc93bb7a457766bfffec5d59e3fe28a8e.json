Waits' stellar first two albums were better represented, with three strong tracks drawn from The Heart of Saturday Night and two from Closing Time, but &quot;Ol' 55&quot; was ignored again, and nothing was included from the third album, Nighthawks at the Diner, which is the favorite of many Waits fans. Three tracks were repeated from Bounced Checks -- &quot;Burma Shave,&quot; &quot;I Never Talk to Strangers,&quot; a duet with Bette Midler, and &quot;Tom Traubert's Blues&quot; -- and they were worthy, but where was &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;? The choices from the later albums were spotty: why use Waits' questionable cover of &quot;Somewhere&quot; from West Side Story and leave out a brilliant story-song like &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot;? The overall unevenness of the Asylum albums cries out for a well-chosen compilation.\nAll Music Review by William Ruhlmann\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Diamonds On My Windshield\n[02] (Looking For) The Heart Of Saturday Night\n[03] Martha\n[04] The Ghosts Of Saturday Night (After Hours At Napoleone's Pizza House)\n[05] Grapefruit Moon\n[06] Small Change (Got Rained On With His Own .3\n[07] Burma Shave\n[08] I Never Talk To Strangers\n[09] Tom Traubert's Blues\n[10] Blue Valentines\n[11] Potter's Field\n[12] Kentucky Avenue\n[13] Somewhere\n[14] Ruby's Arms\n\nPlay Time - 01h:10m:25s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 169mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
