Headlines were dominated by stories of Soviet slave laborers, brainwashed prisoners in Korea, and courageous escapees like Oksana Kasenkina who made a &quot;leap for freedom&quot; from the Soviet Consulate in New York. Full of fascinating and forgotten stories, Cold War Captives explores a central dimension of American culture and politics--the postwar preoccupation with captivity. &quot;Menticide,&quot; the calculated destruction of individual autonomy, struck many Americans as a more immediate danger than nuclear annihilation. Drawing upon a rich array of declassified documents, movies, and reportage--from national security directives to films like The Manchurian Candidate--his book explores the ways in which east-west disputes over prisoners, repatriation, and defection shaped popular culture. Captivity became a way to understand everything from the anomie of suburban housewives to the &quot;slave world&quot; of drug addiction. Sixty years later, this era may seem distant. Yet, with interrogation techniques derived from America's communist enemies now being used in the &quot;war on terror,&quot; the past remains powerfully present.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-Captives-Imprisonment-Brainwashing/dp/0520257316/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372458627&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cold+war+captives&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-Captives-Imprisonment-Brainwashing/dp/0520257316/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372458627&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cold+war+captives&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GaNAFAaEi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GaNAFAaEi&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05968ae48cff43be8c66d2d7eea299f9fc7e3860","amp;dn":"Cold+War+Captives%3A+Imprisonment%2C+Escape%2C+and+Brainwashing+%5Bblack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05968ae48cff43be8c66d2d7eea299f9fc7e3860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,150,138,228,140,255,67,190,140,102,210,215,238,162,153,249,252,126,56,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
