Whether he actually secured it depended upon his obedience and the father's choice. Inheritance was subject to condition and obedience. The Abrahamic Inheritance was based on Divine Oath, conditioned on obedience.\n\nInheritances could be forfeited. The Exodus Generation was promised an inheritance, but failed to obtain it at Kadesh -Barnea. Israel was God's &quot;firstborn son&quot;, yet only 2 of over 2 million took possession of their inheritance. Even Moses was excluded due to his disobedience. Esau, sold his inheritance for a bowl of pottage.\n\nWe have been promised an inheritance in the Kingdom to come. But is there more that is required of us than just our acceptance? Does behavior in this life really influence our future?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef14e0cb2dc930300d77bad66deeab5dffad311d","amp;dn":"Chuck+Missler+-+Inheritance+And+Rewards+%28DivX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef14e0cb2dc930300d77bad66deeab5dffad311d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,20,224,203,45,201,48,48,13,119,186,214,109,238,171,93,255,173,49,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
