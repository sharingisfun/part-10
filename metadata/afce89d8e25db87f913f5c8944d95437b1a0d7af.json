The singles &quot;Ebeneezer Goode,&quot; &quot;L.S.I. (Love Sex Intelligence)&quot; and &quot;Phorever People&quot; all made the British Top Ten, and album tracks like &quot;Space Time,&quot; &quot;Re-Evolution&quot; (with Terence McKenna) and &quot;Scientas&quot; chart the course of the Shamen's history with the astral/sociological collective Spiral Tribe. Boss Drum is a more solid collection than En-Tact. (AMG)\n\n\n\n01. Boss Drum (6:27) \n02. L.S.I. (Love Sex Intelligence) (3:44) (Remix - The Beatmasters, Vocals - Jhelisa)\n03.
