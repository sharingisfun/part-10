One is a family man, works in a nice office, drives an expensive car, and is content to be content. The other one is an antisocial car mechanic with a short fuse.\n\nSome things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change. Others definitely do.\n\nAfter surviving a five-months long kidnapping together, they struggle to return to normalcy, all while realizing that they're more drawn to each other than they ever could've imagined.\n\n&quot;I know I'm not normal, but I'm not fucking stupid.&quot;\n\n&quot;Define normal,&quot; Austin countered quietly, meeting Cam in the doorway. &quot;And for not being normal, you're the only person in the world who makes sense right now. What does that say about me?&quot;\n\nWarning: This story contains violence and scenes of an explicit, erotic nature between two men and is intended for adults, 18+.\nGenre: Romance MM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2514a8f42b5511d2ecc088fc16a1b18bd43e3e19","amp;dn":"Aftermath+-+Dee%2C+Cara.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2514a8f42b5511d2ecc088fc16a1b18bd43e3e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,20,168,244,43,85,17,210,236,192,136,252,22,161,177,139,212,62,62,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
