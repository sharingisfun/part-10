This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\n&quot;I Wonder If I Take You Home&quot; (at number 38 by Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam with Full Force), uses the melody from a famous nursery rhyme (&quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket&quot;) for part of its composition, but in 1938, a jazzed-up version of the actual nursery rhyme gave Ella Fitzgerald her first big hit. Casey plays a sample.\n\nDoes the word, &quot;Eurythmics&quot; mean anything? Casey explains its definition right before announcing &quot;There Must Be An Angel&quot; (at number 27, harmonica by Stevie Wonder). \n\nCasey recalls a song that was written as an afterthought (in about 20 minutes), and ended up selling 18 million copies. It was re-recorded by Steve Allen, Burl Ives, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Sons of the Pioneers, Rusty Draper, and Fess Parker. He also plays a piece of the Bill Hayes version which hit number one.\n\nBryan Adams is in the number five spot with his hit &quot;Summer Of '69.&quot; Casey remembers the five number one songs that dominated the summer of 1969.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;What woman hit the billboard chart over the longest span of time?&quot; Casey strategically places the answer between &quot;We Don't Need Another Hero&quot; (at number four) by Tina Turner and &quot;Freeway Of Love&quot; (at number three) by Aretha Franklin, because these two ladies come in second and third. Casey says the lady who holds that title is named Peggy.\n\nLW#1: The Power Of Love - Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n40:    No Lookin Back - Michael McDonald\n39:    C-I-T-Y - John Cafferty &amp; The Beaver Brown Band\n38:    I Wonder If I Take You Home - Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam with Full Force        \n37:    Every Step Of The Way - John Waite     \n36:    Live Every Moment - REO Speedwagon     \n35:    When Your Heart Is Weak - Cock Robin    \n34:    State Of The Heart - Rick Springfield\n33:    Rock Me Tonight - Freddie Jackson\n32:    Glory Days - Bruce Springsteen\n31:    Saving All My Love For You - Whitney Houston\n30:    Lonely 'Ol Night - John Cougar Mellencamp\n29:    Cry - Godley &amp; Creme    \n28:    Take On Me - A-Ha\n27:    There Must Be An Angel - Eurythmics\n26:    Oh Sheila - Ready For The World\n25:    Shame - The Motels\n24:    Mystery Lady - Billy Ocean\n23:    Dress You Up - Madonna\n22:    You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) - Dead or Alive\n21:    Who's Holding Donna Now - DeBarge\nLDD: Count On Me - The Jefferson Starship\n20:    Life In One Day - Howard Jones\n19:    Everytime You Go Away - Paul Young\n18:    If You Love Somebody Set Them Free - Sting\n17:    Smokin' In The Boys Room - Motley Crue\n16:    Dare Me - The Pointer Sisters\n15:    What About Love - Heart\n14:    Freedom - Wham!\n13:    Pop Life - Prince &amp; The Revolution\n12:    Invincible (Theme from &quot;The Legend Of Billie Jean&quot;) - Pat Benatar\n11:    Don't Lose My Number - Phil Collins\n10:    Money For Nothing - Dire Straits\n9:    You're Only Human (Second Wind) - Billy Joel\nLDD: One Hundred Ways - Quincy Jones with James Ingram\n8:    Cherish - Kool &amp; The Gang\n7:    Never Surrender - Corey Hart\n6:    Shout - Tears For Fears\n5:    Summer Of '69 - Bryan Adams\n4:    We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome) - Tina Turner\n3:    Freeway Of Love - Aretha Franklin\n2:    St. Elmo's Fire (Man In Motion) - John Parr\n1:    The Power Of Love - Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1099480a210c250cdbf353d406ef35d2a344b9a5","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1985_August_31st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1099480a210c250cdbf353d406ef35d2a344b9a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,153,72,10,33,12,37,12,219,243,83,212,6,239,53,210,163,68,185,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
