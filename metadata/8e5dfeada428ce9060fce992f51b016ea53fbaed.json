And yet, we go through life tacitly assuming (or loudly insisting) that we are right about nearly everything - from our political beliefs to our private memories, from our grasp of scientific fact to the merits of our favourite team. \n \n \nBeing Wrong looks at why this conviction has such a powerful grip on us, what happens when this conviction is shaken, and how we interpret the moral, political and psychological significance of being wrong.Drawing on philosophies old and new and cutting-edge neuroscience, Kathryn Schulz offers an eloquent exploration of the allure of certainty and the necessity of fallibility in four main areas: in religion (when the end of the world fails to be nigh); in politics (where were those WMD?); in memory (where did I leave my keys?); and in love (when Mr or Miss Right becomes Mr or Miss Wrong).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5dfeada428ce9060fce992f51b016ea53fbaed","amp;dn":"Being+Wrong+-+Adventures+in+the+Margin+of+Error+-+Kathryn+Schulz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5dfeada428ce9060fce992f51b016ea53fbaed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,93,254,173,164,40,206,144,96,252,233,146,245,27,1,110,165,63,186,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
