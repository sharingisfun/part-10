THANK YOU.\n\nSABLE 1 Features &quot;essential articulations&quot; for the 1st violins and cellos. A deep and detailed articulation list that will provide you with everything you need to create the most amazing string parts. We feel that this module is a game-changer, the first time such a powerful tool can operate within your palette that doesn't behave like a steam train of strings ploughing through your compositions obliterating everything in it's path. With an Albion as a base unit, these sable brushes bring everything into sharp focus. But as a complete set, these will be a thing to behold. We hope sampled section strings will never sound the same again and usher in a new era of sophisticated and diverse string writing.\n\nKONTAKT 5 and above\n\nInstall guide:\n\n- Open your latest Kontakt\n- Go to Libraries tab\n- Click add library\n- Select the directory/folder that you downloaded Albion at.\n- On Win user, just Yes or Accept when prompted to add libary.\n- Mac user, read www.native-instruments.com/en/support/knowledge-base/show/794/\n(Except WITHOUT the key or serial part!)\n- The added library will show up on the left panel.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:845efac143c2e37ffdbb6b4d7bcc8ac6389217ce","amp;dn":"Spitfire+Audio+-+BML+Sable+Strings+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"845efac143c2e37ffdbb6b4d7bcc8ac6389217ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,94,250,193,67,194,227,127,253,187,107,77,123,204,138,198,56,146,23,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
