Hunter.   \n\nFrom the website:\n&quot;Using live actors and actual footage, your family will enjoy learning about \neach prophet and see the character traits that made them men of God. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll \nalso see the actual places they lived and taught, and your testimony will be \nstrengthened as you watch the church progress throughout the years.&quot;  \n\nThese video files were ripped from the individual 14 DVD discs.  Bonus features\nare not included, however, I ripped both English and Spanish subtitles from \n7 of them.  They are in Xvid, avi container packaging, so they are not too \nresource-intensive.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t\t   NOTE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn providing this series as a torrent, I strongly recommend that if you enjoy \nthe series, that you purchase at least a few of the DVDs (or the entire \nseries) from Living Scriptures Inc. to support them.  \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:121d3a95df90c6f096505b190e06bad3d38eba9c","amp;dn":"Living+Scriptures+Inc.+-+Modern+Prophets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"121d3a95df90c6f096505b190e06bad3d38eba9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,29,58,149,223,144,198,240,150,80,91,25,14,6,186,211,211,142,186,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
