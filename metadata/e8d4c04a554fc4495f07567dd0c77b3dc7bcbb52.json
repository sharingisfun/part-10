What is Taoism? What has Piglet to do with either? Te (pronounced &quot;Deh&quot;) is Chinese for Virtue. Taoism is a Chinese philosophy. (Practically speaking, it's more than &quot;Chinese, &quot; and more than &quot;philosophy, &quot; but we'll get into the whys and hows of that further on, inside this book). And Piglet has quite a bit to do with both. What exactly? In the first place . . . That is, he . . . What we mean is . . . Perhaps we'd better let the author do the explaining. In any event, Piglet not only has quite bit to do with Te and Taoism; he also has quite a bit to do with you and me - as have Te and Taoism - whoever we may happen to be, whatever we may happen to be doing. And that is a Very Useful Thing to Know. As you will see.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d4c04a554fc4495f07567dd0c77b3dc7bcbb52","amp;dn":"Benjamin+Hoff+-+The+Te+of+Piglet+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d4c04a554fc4495f07567dd0c77b3dc7bcbb52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,212,192,74,85,79,196,73,95,7,86,125,208,199,123,61,199,188,187,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
