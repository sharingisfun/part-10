Gallagher , Patrick N. Allitt , Allen C. Guelzo\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\n\nThis is the story of a country in which immigrants of the late 19th and early 20th centuries huddled in cramped tenement apartments lit by hazardous kerosene lamps. And a country that, little more than a half-century later, renowned economist John Kenneth Galbraith described as &quot;The Affluent Society.&quot;\n\nThis is the chronicle of a nation that enslaved a race of people. And of a nation that fought a Civil War that freed its slaves, and outlawed segregation and discrimination.\n\nThis is history shaped by Revolutionary War and Vietnam, Thomas Jefferson and William Jefferson Clinton, Puritanism and Feminism, Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Jamestown and Disneyland, Harpers Ferry and Henry Ford, oil wells and Orson Welles.\n\nThis is a review of the extraordinary blend of people, ideas, inventions, and events that comprise The History of the United States. In this seven-part, 84-lecture series, three noted historians and lecturersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½two of whom teach other popular Teaching Company coursesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½present the nation's past through their areas of special interest.\n\n\n84 Lectures\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n\n1 Living Bravely\n2 Spain, France, and the Netherlands\n3 Gentlemen in the Wilderness\n4 Radicals in the Wilderness\n5 Traders in the Wilderness\n6 An Economy of Slaves\n7 Printers, Painters, and Preachers\n8 The Great Awakening\n9 The Great War for Empire\n10 The Rejection of Empire\n11 The American RevolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Politics and People\n12 The American RevolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Howe's War\n13 The American RevolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Washington's War\n14 Creating the Constitution\n15 Hamilton's Republic\n16 Republicans and Federalists\n17 Adams and Liberty\n18 The Jeffersonian Reaction\n19 Territory and Treason\n20 The Agrarian Republic\n21 The Disastrous War of 1812\n22 The &quot;American System&quot;\n23 A Nation Announcing Itself\n24 National Republican Follies\n25 The Second Great Awakening\n26 Dark Satanic Mills\n27 The Military Chieftain\n28 The Politics of Distrust\n29 The Monster Bank\n30 Whigs and Democrats\n31 American Romanticism\n32 The Age of Reform\n33 Southern Society and the Defense of Slavery\n34 Whose Manifest Destiny?\n35 The Mexican War\n36 The Great Compromise\n37 Sectional Tensions Escalate\n38 Drifting Toward Disaster\n39 The Coming of War\n40 The First Year of Fighting\n41 Shifting Tides of Battle\n42 Diplomatic Clashes and Sustaining the War\n43 Behind the LinesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Politics and Economies\n44 African Americans in Wartime\n45 The Union Drive to Victory\n46 Presidential Reconstruction\n47 Congress Takes Command\n48 Reconstruction Ends\n49 Industrialization\n50 Transcontinental Railroads\n51 The Last Indian Wars\n52 Farming the Great Plains\n53 African Americans after Reconstruction\n54 Men and Women\n55 Religion in Victorian America\n56 The Populists\n57 The New Immigration\n58 City Life\n59 Labor and Capital\n60 Theodore Roosevelt and Progressivism\n61 Mass Production\n62 World War IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Road to Intervention\n63 World War IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Versailles and Wilson's Gambit\n64 The 1920s\n65 The Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression\n66 The New Deal\n67 World War IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Road to Pearl Harbor\n68 World War IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The European Theater\n69 World War IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Pacific Theater\n70 The Cold War\n71 The Korean War and McCarthyism\n72 The Affluent Society\n73 The Civil Rights Movement\n74 The New Frontier and the Great Society\n75 The Rise of Mass Media\n76 The Vietnam War\n77 The Women's Movement\n78 Nixon and Watergate\n79 Environmentalism\n80 Religion in Twentieth-Century America\n81 Carter and the Reagan Revolution\n82 The New World Order\n83 Clinton's America and the Millennium\n84 Reflections ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf9e20f29945cc4abb33cb9b97b9c1e89b31561","amp;dn":"TTC+-+History+of+the+United+States+%282nd+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf9e20f29945cc4abb33cb9b97b9c1e89b31561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,249,226,15,41,148,92,196,171,179,60,185,185,123,156,30,137,179,21,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
