They are extremely guarded about their religion, and what they consider blasphemous acts by sceptical Muslims and non-Muslims alike has only served to pique the world's curiosity. This critical examination reveals an unflattering picture of the faith and its practitioners. Nevertheless, it is the truth, something that has either been deliberately concealed by modern scholars or buried in obscure journals accessible only to a select few.\n\nAuthor: Ibn Warraq\nPublisher: Prometheus Books\nPublication Date: June 30, 2010 (2003)\n\nFormats:\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828f96fe9a18f1f9327de1c8c1626aa45b6f0b63","amp;dn":"Ibn+Warraq+-+Why+I+Am+Not+a+Muslim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828f96fe9a18f1f9327de1c8c1626aa45b6f0b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,143,150,254,154,24,241,249,50,125,225,200,193,98,106,164,91,111,11,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
