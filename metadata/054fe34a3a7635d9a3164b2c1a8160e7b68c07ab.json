So what? No one seems to have noticed that Belushi was as obsessive about citing his sources as Frank Sinatra is about naming his arrangers -- you'd have thought those critics would have appreciated the footnotes. The beneficiaries of Belushi's encomiums didn't mind the increased exposure or the renewed royalty checks (&quot;I suggest you buy as many blues albums as you can,&quot; Belushi told the audience), and even today, what comes across in these performances is the sincerity of feeling -- that and some tasty playing from a top-notch band.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:054fe34a3a7635d9a3164b2c1a8160e7b68c07ab","amp;dn":"The+Blues+Brothers+-+Briefcase+Full+of+Blues+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"054fe34a3a7635d9a3164b2c1a8160e7b68c07ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,79,227,74,58,118,53,217,163,22,75,44,26,129,96,231,182,140,7,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
