The twist is that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have control over what the citizens do, they simply give basic build orders and the townsfolk will try to accommodate their time to the player's needs. If a player isn't careful they might dig too deep, too quickly and open themselves up to some very nasty creatures.\n\n\n\nChangelog:\nVersion v14c\n\nAdd: Moebius, the new guy\nChange: Update to LWJGL 2.9.1\nChange: Now fullscreen mode is stored in the towns.ini property, so the game will restart in fullscreen if you leave it in fullscreen.\nChange: Messages icon won't start blinking directly when a new game ist created just because of the Towns version information.\nFix: An item over a zone that is replaced because an action now maintains the locked status\nFix: OSX is now supported out of the box\n\n-----\nNote\n- Towns v14c IS savegame compatible with Towns v9 and higher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5db7848d042b7746ab9f9d2b2b3b68c2794822c","amp;dn":"Towns+v14c+WIN-MAC-LIN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5db7848d042b7746ab9f9d2b2b3b68c2794822c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,219,120,72,208,66,183,116,106,185,249,210,178,179,182,140,39,148,130,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
