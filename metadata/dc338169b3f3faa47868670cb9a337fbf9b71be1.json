The Takeaways formed in Sydney mid-1983 as a four-piece with a drum machine. The band plays all original songs.  Replaced drum machine with near human being Johnny Black. Recorded independent single 'Sweet &amp; Sour' early 1984. The single received wide alternative airplay. The Takeaways toured Melbourne to promote single and were favourably received by the more discriminating punters. This is the band's first LP. \n \nTracklisting:\n\nA1   Sweet &amp; Sour (3:03) \n     \nA2   Hip Romeo (2:21) \n      \nA3   Moon And Stars (2:17) \n     \nA4   Chicken Feed - Part 1 (0:25) \n     \nA5   Singing In The Shower (2:43)  \n\nA6   It's A Game (2:31) \n       \nA7   Glam To Wham (4:10) \n     \nB1   Heart Plays Tricks (2:47) \n      \nB2   On The Street Where U Live (2:50) \n     \nB3   Too Hot To Move (4:16) \n     \nB4   Little Boxes (1:04) \n     \nB5   No Worries (2:20) \n      \nB6   Party On Wheels (2:31) \n  \nB7   Sweet (2:50) \n     \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc338169b3f3faa47868670cb9a337fbf9b71be1","amp;dn":"The+Takeaways+-+Sweet+and+Sour+%5B1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc338169b3f3faa47868670cb9a337fbf9b71be1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,51,129,105,179,243,250,164,120,104,103,12,185,163,55,251,249,183,27,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
