Although these two musicians emerged from very different backgrounds, there is nonetheless a certain commonality, the most obvious being that both jazz and flamenco are highly improvisational, demanding nearly supernatural levels of empathy between collaborating musicians. Although their debut concentrated primarily upon Spanish sources, they've now moved on to styles of lateral Iberian descent, notably the stylishly intellectual neo-tangos of Argentina's Astor Piazzolla, with a nod to his influential forebear, Carlos Gardel. Mr. Camilo's Juilliard training must have come in handy when essaying these works, as both composers were deeply familiar with European sources such as the works of French impressionists like Debussy, Ravel, and FaurÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹. The album also includes a gently reflective rendering of &quot;Stella by Starlight,&quot; coming to a close with &quot;Amor de Conuco,&quot; a romantically retro nuevo cancion-like ballad by Mr. Camilo's countryman, Juan Luis Guerra, with vocals by the composer. \n-- amazon.com\n\nTracks\n01- El Dia Que Me Quieras\n02- Libertango\n03- Fuga y Misterio\n04- Adios Nonino\n05- Stella By Starlight\n06- Twilight Glow\n07- A Los Nietos\n08- La Tarde\n09- La Fiesta\n10- From Within\n11- Amor De Conuco\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d6862d54bf9168192beda7164aff21d087f24d","amp;dn":"Michel+Camilo+%26+Tomatito+-+Spain+Again+%5BFLAC%5D+FSM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d6862d54bf9168192beda7164aff21d087f24d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,214,134,45,84,191,145,104,25,43,237,167,22,74,255,33,208,135,242,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
