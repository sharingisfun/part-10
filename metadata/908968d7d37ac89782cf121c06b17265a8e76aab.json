In this unforgettable new spinoff of the Billionaire books from New York Times bestselling indie author Melody Anne, two strangers must look past their painful memories to make way for everlasting love.\n\nAlyssa's modeling career came to an abrupt end when her manager boyfriend emptied her bank account and ruined her professional reputation. Now she's heading to a new town in Montana to rebuild her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€if she can even get there (stupid delayed planes!). But things are looking up when she's upgraded to first class and a mysterious stranger sits down next to herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nJackson Whitman doesn't believe in love, or commitment, or foreverÃ¢â‚¬â€not since he lost his wife and daughter. But the beautiful woman sitting next to him at the gate has him rethinking that position. Can he convince her to be his for the night? Or will she convince him to be hers for a lifetime?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:908968d7d37ac89782cf121c06b17265a8e76aab","amp;dn":"Her+Unexpected+Hero+%5BUnexpected+Heroes%2C+%2301%5D+-+Melody+Anne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"908968d7d37ac89782cf121c06b17265a8e76aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,137,104,215,211,122,200,151,130,207,18,28,6,177,114,101,168,231,106,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
