This book reveals the proven techniques thousands of people have used to attain all of the money they wanted while living healthy, happy and balanced lives. The Power of Focus, the new blockbuster from the coauthors of the bestselling Chicken Soup for the Soul, is a practical no-nonsense guide that shows readers how to reach their business, personal and financial goals without getting burned out in the process.\r\nCanfield, Hansen, and Hewitt have taken the best ideas from their own successful careers (seventy-nine years of combined business expertise), and distilled them into ten powerful focusing principles. The result is a treasury of insights that is enjoyable to read and easy to understand. At the outset, the book identifies the three most important fundamentals for consistent success: developing unusual clarity; understanding that habits determine your future; and using a &quot;no exceptions policy&quot; approach to focus on what you want. Numerous anecdotes and inspiring stories help to reinforce each principle. This is a must-read for business people, sales managers, entrepreneurs, and anyone who is serious about improving their personal awareness.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t          .:.Shailab.:.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t         https://thepiratebay.la/user/shailab/\r\n\r\n      \t\t\t\t   https://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab00867b092814bbcca9b8010456f1f93656fe91","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+Focus+-+Jack+Canfield%2C+Mark+Victor+Hansen%2C+Les+Hewi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab00867b092814bbcca9b8010456f1f93656fe91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,0,134,123,9,40,20,187,204,169,184,1,4,86,241,249,54,86,254,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
