How do they foster either conformity or innovation? What holds communities together and what happens when they fragment or fall apart? How is community life changing in response to technological advances?\n\nRefreshingly accessible and built on fascinating case examples, this unique book provides not only the theoretical grounding necessary to understand how and why the burgeoning area of social network analysis can be useful in studying communities, but also clear technical explanations of the tools of network analysis and how to gather and analyze real-world network data. Network analysis allows us to see community life in a new perspective, with sometimes surprising results and insights, and this book enables readers to gain a deeper understanding of social life and the relationships that build (and break) communities.\nThis engaging text will be an exciting new resource for upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate students in a wide range of courses including social network analysis, community studies, urban studies, organizational studies, and quantitative methods.\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72df898a0bdb7035cf7c0cf51483968a941b6ae8","amp;dn":"Communities+and+Networks-+Giuffre+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72df898a0bdb7035cf7c0cf51483968a941b6ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,223,137,138,11,219,112,53,207,124,12,245,20,131,150,138,148,27,106,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
