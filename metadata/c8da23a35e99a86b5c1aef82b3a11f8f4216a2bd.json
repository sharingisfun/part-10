On the U.S. Billboard 200, the album debuted at #35, selling about 29,000 copies in its first week\nAll of the songs on the album had been previously released by Morrison, and most were recorded by him before being used in a movie.

Two of the recordings, however, were previously unreleased, including a version of &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; recorded specifically for the collection. The version of the album available for download on iTunes contains the song &quot;These Are the Days&quot;.
