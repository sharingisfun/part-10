Throughout the next decade, Ponty recorded 12 visionary albums all of which entered the Billboard Jazz Charts in the top 5. This collection of original recordings features five of the albums recorded by Ponty during that time. These recordings established Ponty as key player in the growing jazz-rock movement at the time. In 1977, Ponty charted in the top 40 with Enigmatic Ocean and again with Cosmic Messenger in 1978.\n\nThrough his work, Jean-Luc Ponty liberated the violinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s image and capabilities from its classical and folk roots. By experimenting with electronics and synthesizers, he came a pioneer of the electric violin in the 1970s, going on to become the undisputed master of his instrument in this area. On his solo work, Ponty displays his own brand of imaginative jazz fusion, unpredictable and adventurous. This set of original recordings released by Warner Jazz is a must have for fans of jazz fusion.
