This essential collection contains Gospels describing Jesus's infancy, ministry, Passion, and resurrection, as well as the most controversial manuscript discoveries of modern times, including the most significant Gospel discovered in the 20th century -- the Gospel of Thomas -- and the most recently discovered Gospel, the Gospel of Judas Iscariot. \n\nFor the first time ever, these sacred manuscripts are featured in the original Greek, Latin, and Coptic languages, accompanied by fresh English translations that appear next to the original texts, allowing for easy line by line comparison.  Also, each translation begins with a thoughtful examination of key historical, literary, and textual issues that places each Gospel in its proper context.  The end result is a resource that enables anyone interested in Christianity or the early Church to understand -- better than ever before -- the deeper meanings of these apocryphal Gospels.\n\nThe Apocryphal Gospels is much more than an annotated guide to the Gospels. Through its authoritative use of both native text and engaging, accurate translations, it provides an unprecedented look at early Christianity and the New Testament.  This is an indispensable volume for any reader interested in church history, antiquity, ancient languages, or the Christian faith.\n\n\nContents\n\nInfancy Gospels\nInfancy Gospel of Thomas \nInfancy Gospel of Thomas C \nProto-Gospel of James \nGospel of Pseudo Matthew \nLatin Infancy Gospels \nCoptic History of Joseph the Carpenter \nMinistry Gospels \nJewish Christian Gospels \nGospel of the Nazareans \nGospel of the Ebionites \nGospel according to the Hebrews \nGospel of the Egyptians \nA Gospel Harmony: The Diatesseron \nPapyrus Berlin 11710 \nPapyrus Cairensis 10735 \nPapyrus Egerton 2 \nPapyrus Merton 51 \nP Oxy 210 \nP Oxy 840\nP Oxy 1224 \nP Oxy 2949 \nP Oxy 4009 \nP Vindob G 2325 \nSayings Gospels and Agrapha\nGospel of Thomas \nGospel of Thomas: Greek fragments \nAgrapha \nPassion / Resurrection/ and Post-Resurrection Gospels\nGospel of Peter \nGospel of Judas \nAbgar Legend \nGospel of Nicodemus A \nGospel of Nicodemus B \nReport of Pilate \nHanding over of Pilate \nLetter of Pilate to Claudius \nLetter of Pilate to Herod \nLetter of Herod to Pilate \nLetter of Tiberius to Pilate \nVindicta Salvatoris \nMors Pilati \nNarrative of Joseph of Arimathea \nGospel of Mary \nGospel of Mary: Greek fragments\nGreater Questions of Mary\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee2e6e6375567cae0830c389290472429273fece","amp;dn":"Bart+Ehrman+-+The+Apocryphal+Gospels%3A+Texts+%26amp%3B+Translations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee2e6e6375567cae0830c389290472429273fece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,46,110,99,117,86,124,174,8,48,195,137,41,4,114,66,146,115,254,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
