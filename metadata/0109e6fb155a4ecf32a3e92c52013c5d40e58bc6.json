London Ltd | 2016 | English | 116 pages | True PDF | 27.2 mb\r\n\r\nPatrick Mooreâ€™s Guide to the Moon is designed to help you explore our near neighbour. Within, youâ€™ll find the best of Sir Patrick Mooreâ€™s Moonwatch lunar observing columns, published in BBC Sky at Night Magazine between 2008 and 2012, plus a few from the Sky at Night TV showâ€™s Pete Lawrence. Weâ€™ve arranged these by quadrant, then by decreasing latitude for ease of reference. Plus weâ€™ll give you a guide to the basics of lunar observing, tell you how you can go deeper to explore its hidden valleys and inconspicuous dome fields, and even induct you into the realm of lunar imaging. What makes the Moon special is that anyone can see it, whether you live under dark skies or in the centre of London, whether you have a telescope or rely on your eyes alone. All you need to do is look up.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nTHE MOON IN A NUTSHELL\r\nPatrickâ€™s perspectives: Once a Moon man, always a Moon man . . . 6\r\nOur constant companion: a potted primer  . . . 8\r\nSizing up the Moon . . . 17\r\nSubscribe to BBC Sky at Night Magazine . . . 22\r\nOBSERVING THE MOON\r\nPatrickâ€™s perspectives: Changing craters and shifting seas  . . . 24\r\nLunar observing basics . . . 26\r\nMOONWATCH The northeast quadrant . . . 30\r\nThe Moonâ€™s true colours  . . . 42\r\nMOONWATCH The southeast quadrant  . . . 46\r\nDiscover the valleys of the Moon  . . . 58\r\nMOONWATCH The northwest quadrant . . . 64\r\nExplore the lunar domes . . . 79\r\nMOONWATCH The southwest quadrant  . . . 84\r\nA beginnerâ€™s guide to lunar imaging  . . . 98\r\nTHE FUTURE OF LUNAR EXPLORATION\r\nPatrickâ€™s perspectives: Unmanned missions to the Moon must continue . . . 104\r\nThe new race for the Moon  . . . 106\r\nA telescope for the far side  . . . 112\r\nWe need a moonbase to explore the stars . . . 114\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/l9vnjz57p/Patrick_Moore_s_Guide_to_the_Moon_BBC_Sky_at_Ni.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0109e6fb155a4ecf32a3e92c52013c5d40e58bc6","amp;dn":"Patrick+Moore%27s+Guide+to+the+Moon+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0109e6fb155a4ecf32a3e92c52013c5d40e58bc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,9,230,251,21,90,78,207,50,163,233,44,82,1,60,93,64,229,139,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
