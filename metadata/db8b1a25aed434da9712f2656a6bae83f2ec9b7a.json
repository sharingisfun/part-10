Leading military historians deal with the different national approaches to war and military power at the tactical, operational, strategic, and political levels. They form the basis for a fundamental reexamination of how military organizations have performed in the first half of the twentieth century. Volume 1 covers World War I. The other two volumes address the interwar period and World War II, respectively. Now in a new edition, with a new introduction by the editors, these classic volumes will remain invaluable for military historians and social scientists in their examination of national security and military issues. They will also be essential reading for future military leaders at Staff and War Colleges.\n\n# Paperback: 1108 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (August 9, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0521737494\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521737494","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8b1a25aed434da9712f2656a6bae83f2ec9b7a","amp;dn":"Military+Effectiveness+%5B3Vols%5D+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8b1a25aed434da9712f2656a6bae83f2ec9b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,139,26,37,174,212,52,218,151,18,242,101,106,107,174,131,242,236,155,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
