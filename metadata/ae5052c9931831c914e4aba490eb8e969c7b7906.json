The group was founded by guitarist/vocalist George Kooymans and bassist/vocalist Rinus Gerritsen, then schoolboys, in 1961; several years and personnel shifts later, they had their first Dutch hit, &quot;Please Go,&quot; and in 1968 hit the top of the Dutch charts for the first of many times with &quot;Dong-Dong-Di-Ki-Di-Gi-Dong,&quot; a song that broadened their European appeal. By 1969, the rest of the lineup had stabilized, with lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Barry Hay and drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk. They experimented with their style for several years before settling on straightforward hard rock initially much like that of the Who, who invited them to open their 1972 European tour. Golden Earring signed to the Who's Track label, which released a compilation of Dutch singles, Hearing Earring, helping the group break through in England. Released in 1974, the Moontan LP spawned the single &quot;Radar Love,&quot; a Dutch number one, U.K. Top Ten, and U.S. number 13 hit. \n\n\nArtist...............: Golden Earring\nAlbum................: The Very Best Of\nGenre................: Classic Rock\nSource...............: CD {Red Bullet #RB 66.264}\nYear.................: 2008\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/19/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front, Back, CD, Inside\n\n\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Please Go\n02.That Day\n03.Daddy Buy Me A Girl\n04.Sound Of The Screaming Day\n05.Dong-Dong-Di-Ki-Di-Gi-Dong\n06.Just A Little Bit Of Peace In My Heart\n07.Another 45 Miles\n08.Back Home\n09.Holy Holy Life\n10.She Flies On Strange Wings\n11.Buddy Joe\n12.Stand By Me\n13.Radar Love\n14.Bombay\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Weekend Love\n02.Long Blond Animal\n03.Twilight Zone\n04.The Devil Made Me Do It\n05.When The Lady Smiles\n06.Clear Night, Moonlight\n07.Something Heavy Going Down\n08.Quiet Eyes\n09.My Killer, My Shadow\n10.Going To The Run\n11.I Can't Sleep Without You\n12.Johnny Make Believe\n13.Burning Stuntman\n14.Paradise In Distress\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae5052c9931831c914e4aba490eb8e969c7b7906","amp;dn":"Golden+Earring+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282008%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae5052c9931831c914e4aba490eb8e969c7b7906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,80,82,201,147,24,49,201,20,228,171,164,144,235,142,150,156,123,121,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
