Oil exploitation, uncontrolled fuel spills, popractices for final disposal of industrial wastes, overuse of pesticides,\nand operation of sanitary landfills are some causes of pollution of\nsoils and groundwaters.\n\nIn the course of the last two decades a wide variety of technologies\nhas been developed for clean-up operations of contaminated soils and\naquifers. They can be classified in terms of their principle of operation:\nphysicochemical, thermal and biological. Among the biological\ntechnologies bioremediation has evolved as the most promising one\nbecause of its economical, safety and environmental features since\norganic contaminants become actually transformed, and some of them\nare fully mineralized.\n\nThe success of bioremediation techniques is directly related to\nthe metabolic capability of involved microorganisms and can be affected\nby the surrounding microenvironment. This chapter describes the\nmechanism of bioremediation; an overview is presented of its virtues\nand weaknesses\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272363394b07ac605313ff02fb2e1e373df14fed","amp;dn":"Microbiology+and+Immunology+-+Oceanhawk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272363394b07ac605313ff02fb2e1e373df14fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,35,99,57,75,7,172,96,83,19,255,2,251,46,30,55,61,241,79,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
