However, many of his most incredible experiences might just shock you. For much of his life, he has brushed up against the supernatural world and he's seen ghosts up close and personal-whether it be while combing an abandoned house in his native Iowa as a child or recording with Slipknot in the fabled &quot;Houdini&quot; Hollywood Hills mansion. He's also got the memories (and scars) to prove it. \n\n\nSpecial thanks to workerbee.\n\nEnjoy!\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b766c723a517b260b1a9964e0aea171169d47a2","amp;dn":"A+Funny+Thing+Happened+On+The++Heaven+by+Corey+Taylor+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b766c723a517b260b1a9964e0aea171169d47a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,118,108,114,58,81,123,38,11,26,153,100,224,174,161,113,22,157,71,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
