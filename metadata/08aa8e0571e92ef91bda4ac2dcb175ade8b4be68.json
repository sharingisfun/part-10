The Phantom operated out of Bangalla (somewhere along the East African coast), but would pursue evil doers across the globe. Those who faced him were visually marked for life, left with a skull shaped scar on their faces, indelibly marked by the ring on his right hand when he strikes his enemies. \nThe Phantom is both more, and less, than his legend. Instead of a single, undying entity, the Phantom is a dynasty of crime fighters, who have sworn down the years to protect the innocent and punish the guilty, and if necessary to lay down their lives in the service of justice. The current Phantom, Kit Walker (every male child is named as Kit), is the 21st Phantom. He is married to Diana Palmer and has two children, Kit and Heloise. \n\nLee Falk is the creator of Phantom and Mandrake the Magician. Even after so many decades, both the characters are still running as of 2008. The Phantom is the first, yes first superhero, before Batman, before Superman, before any other to wear a skin tight costume and a mask, which has become the hallmark of comic book super heroes. The Phantom is also the most realistic and believable superhero, with no superpowers, no magic and no fictional high tech gadgetry either. He is all human and wins on the basis of his athletic prowess and common sense. The Phantom is immensely popular in USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil, India, Scandinavia and UK where it has been regularly published as a comic book or newspaper strip. \n\nThe Phantom is one of my personal favorite characters. I was inspired a lot by Phantom during my childhood. I have tried my best to compile this torrent as the most comprehensive Phantom torrent. I wonÃƒÂ¢??t say itÃƒÂ¢??s complete, as many Indrajal (Indian print) are not even scanned. Many issues of other publishers like Frew are also not complete. Still I have tried to include all the Gold Key, King, Charlton, Moonstone, DC, and Marvel prints. Harvey hits prints of Phantom are also included. I donÃƒÂ¢??t have complete Egmont and only a few issues are posted. Some stripes are also included. If anyone has issues not covered here, then please feel free to post an update to this torrent. \n\nPhantom is for everyone kids, young and old alike. One word of message for kids (parents too), I can tell you this because of my own personal experience, if you read Phantom, you will never ever be bullied by anyone in school or any other field. The guy and his stories inspire a lot. \n\nI would like to thank Lee Falk (May his soul rest in peace) for creating Phantom. To all those writers and artists who over the years have brought so many classic stories of Phantom. I would also like to thank all the original scanners and up loaders, without which I wouldnÃƒÂ¢??t have been able to compile this torrent. \n\nP.S. Special thanks to DieSmurfDie and SIRÃƒÂ¢??s at comicsearch.co.uk to help me with a few missing issues of Moonstone. \n\nEnjoy and Seed well. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a big torrent I wonÃƒÂ¢??t like to see it dying a premature death. I want it to stay alive like Phantom, who is still here after so many decades.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08aa8e0571e92ef91bda4ac2dcb175ade8b4be68","amp;dn":"The+Phantom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08aa8e0571e92ef91bda4ac2dcb175ade8b4be68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,170,142,5,113,233,46,249,27,218,74,194,220,177,117,173,232,180,190,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
