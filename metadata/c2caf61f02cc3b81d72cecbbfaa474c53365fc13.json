If the '70s were marked by promise and the '80s by disappointment, the '90s, thanks to three smash studio albums, were sheer triumph for Bonnie Raitt, and she sounds damned satisfied. Her first live recording after 24 years in the business, Road Tested is an all-things-to-all-people effort, unsurprising given its creator has become all things to an awful lot of people. Steadfast favorites, '90s hits, and fresh additions to her repertoire are spiced by guest appearances by Bruce Hornsby, Ruth Brown, Charles Brown, Jackson Browne, Kim Wilson, and Bryan Adams. Raitt is in fine voice, her playing is great, and the band is solid.\n\nBonnie Raitt\nRoad Tested (1995) Live\n2xCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers\nApprox 237Mb\n\nDisc: 1\n01 Thing Called Love\n02 Three Time Loser \n03 Love Letter \n04 Never Make Your Move Too Soon \n05 Something To Talk About\n06 Matters Of The Heart    \n07 Shake A Little    \n08 Have A Heart    \n09 Love Me Like A Mann     \n10 Kokomo    \n11 Louise     \n12 Dimming Of The Day\n\nDisc: 2\n01 Longing In Their Hearts \n02 Come To Me \n03 Love Sneakin' Up On You\n04 Burning Down The House\n05 I Can't Make You Love Me  \n06 Feeling Of Falling   \n07 I Believe I'm In Love With You\n08 Rock Steady\n09 My Opening Farewell\n10 Angel From Montgomery  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2caf61f02cc3b81d72cecbbfaa474c53365fc13","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Raitt+-+Road+Tested+%281995%29+live+++%40+320+++covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2caf61f02cc3b81d72cecbbfaa474c53365fc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,202,246,31,2,204,59,129,215,44,236,187,250,164,116,197,51,101,252,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
