Simon Nicol later wrote\n\n&quot;We secured a deal with Vertigo, the one that ended up with them paying us not to make records. It seemed a novelty, like that Marx Brothers line: &quot;How much for you NOT to rehearse?&quot; &quot;Oh, you can't afford it.&quot; We did Bonny Bunch and Tipplers Tales then didn't make the other four contracted albums&quot; \nDave Pegg would later say\n\n&quot;It wasn't a great deal of money. It was about Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£30,000. It was the first time we had ever made money out of music. We got like Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£7,000 each. It was more money than we'd ever had in our lives. This was back in '78 and it enabled us to split up.&quot;\nTipplers Tales was described by Allmusic as &quot;not a concept album, even though alcohol is a recurrent motif in many of the traditional numbers&quot;, but nonetheless &quot;doing what the band members do best -- taking some fine old traditional English jigs, reels, and traditional narratives and putting their own distinctive folk-rock stamp on them&quot;. Following the release of Tippler's Tales, Fairport would not record for the following seven years until the Gladys' Leap album in 1985.\n\nSeveral of the traditional folk songs had previously been recorded by A. L. Lloyd accompanied by Dave Swarbrick. The version of &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; here is close to the version recorded by Traffic, as Steve Winwood had been taught the song by The Watersons. The tune is based on &quot;Wir PflÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼gen&quot; by Johann Schultz, better known as We Plough The Fields and Scatter, an old English harvest festival hymn.\n\nDave Swarbrick - fiddle, mandolin, mandocello, vocals \nSimon Nicol - electric and acoustic guitars, vocals, dulcimer, piano \nDave Pegg - bass guitar, guitar, mandolin, vocals \nBruce Rowland - drums, percussion, electric piano \nBarry Hammond - engineer \n\nAudio CD (19 Feb 2007) \nNumber of Discs: 1 \nLabel: Commercial Marketing \nASIN: B000MNNRXW \n\nAll tracks credited as &quot;Traditional&quot; unless otherwise stated\n\n&quot;Ye Mariners All&quot; (Bottom Of The Punch Bowl/ East Nuke Of Fyfe/Ye Mariners All) - 4:29 \n&quot;Three Drunken Maidens&quot; - 2:46 \n&quot;Jack O'Rion&quot; (Jack O'Rion/Turnabout/Tiree/Miss Stevenson's/Do It Now/March of the Last/Turnabout) : 11:04 \n&quot;Reynard The Fox&quot; - 3:02 \n&quot;Lady Of Pleasure&quot; (Allan Taylor) - 2:34 \n&quot;Bankruptured&quot; (Dave Pegg) - 1:55 \n&quot;The Widow of Westmoorland&quot; - 3:23[10] \n&quot;The Hair of the Dogma&quot; (Dave Pegg) - 1:48 \n&quot;As Bitme&quot; (Dave Pegg/Bruce Rowland) - 1:40 \n&quot;John Barleycorn&quot; - 4:39 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd1712f5db1c3f95cdf644399435e248eabe8ee","amp;dn":"Fairport+Convention...Tippler%5C%27s+Tales%281978%29remastered%282007%29%5BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd1712f5db1c3f95cdf644399435e248eabe8ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,209,113,47,93,177,195,249,92,223,100,67,153,67,94,36,142,171,232,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
