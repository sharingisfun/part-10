February is summertime in\nthis subtropical paradise. I heard dripping sounds late\nat night, on the wooden deck and leaves nearby, sparse\npercussion among cicadas and chirping tree frogs. I assumed\nit was condensation from morningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s light rain. Next day, I\nlooked up to see these drops coming from foamy packets\nsuspended in forked twigs among the foliage. Tiny dots of\nfrog eggs filled each frothy airborne puddle. These tree\nfrogs had circumvented an amphibianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s need for standing\nwater for their young to mature. They created their own\ndiaphanous ponds in the leaf canopy, strong enough to stay\nintact as eggs hatched and tadpoles developed lungs and\nlegs, yet porous enough to absorb and retain moisture from\nthe light summer rains. To me it seemed miraculous.\n\nNest represents unfinished business for me. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album\nthat might have come from my childhood, from a hidden quiet\nplace. I rarely make such calm music. Nest folds inward\nlike a nurturing cushion; yet it never sits motionless, it\nevolves towards a kernel of revelation with slow searching\nenergy.\n\nNest began with recordings from the eastern Australian\nbush,Ãƒâ€š when I was on tour in February 2012. I often\nincorporate natural sounds into my music, but this music\nwanted to live entirely in outdoor soundscapes, surrounded\nby a subdued yet palpable sense of life. This texture\nresembles my earliest releases like Sunyata, Trances and\nDrones, where the natural world integrates completely with\nthe music.\n\nI approach these juxtapositions of music and nature\nrecordings with caution, as they risk sounding trite. For\nme, the combination works best when the music retains an\nattentive, submissive quality. For an album like this, I\nremove so much material during creation that I struggle to\nleave any music at all. Each note serves primarily to\noutline its own absence, to create an illusion of silence.\n\nLike much of my music, Nest also explores tuning systems,\nincluding just intonation. Over time I have become more\nrelaxed about tuning, shifting where the instruments sound\nmost natural. Nest navigates towards harmonic intervals when\npiano is absent, toward equal temperament when piano\ndominates, searching for a certain fragile balance.\n\nRobert Rich Ã¢â‚¬â€œ August 2012\n\n****If you like his music, please consider buying his work at his website and supporting him: ****\n\nwww.robertrich.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a557b9774cc8acb44cf30a571ab8ffce091c6c52","amp;dn":"Robert+Rich+-+Nest+%28October+2012+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a557b9774cc8acb44cf30a571ab8ffce091c6c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,87,185,119,76,200,172,180,76,243,10,87,26,184,255,206,9,28,108,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
