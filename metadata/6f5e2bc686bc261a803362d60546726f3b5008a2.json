If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5e2bc686bc261a803362d60546726f3b5008a2","amp;dn":"Duplicate+File+Detector+4.7+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5e2bc686bc261a803362d60546726f3b5008a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,94,43,198,134,188,38,26,128,51,98,214,5,70,114,111,59,80,8,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
