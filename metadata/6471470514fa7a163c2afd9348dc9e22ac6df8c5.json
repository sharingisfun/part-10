If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve      :\n : bought or built a 3D printer such as a MakerBot only to be confounded by   :\n : jagged edges, corner lift, top layers that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solid, or any of a myriad:\n : of other problems that plague 3D printer enthusiasts, then here is the book:\n : to help you get past all that and recapture the joy of creative            :\n : fabrication. The book also includes valuable tips for builders and those   :\n : who want to modify their printers to get the most out of their investment. :\n :                                                                            :\n : Good fabrication begins with calibration. Aligning the print bed to support:\n : deposition of medium in three dimensions is critical. Even off-the-shelf   :\n : machines that are pre-built must be aligned and periodically realigned     :\n : throughout their life cycle. Maintaining and Troubleshooting Your 3D       :\n : Printer helps you achieve and hold proper alignment. Maintaining and       :\n : Troubleshooting Your 3D Printer also helps with software and hardware      :\n : troubleshooting.
