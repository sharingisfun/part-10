Taming a lion? Winning a Nobel Prize? Well, here's how to attempt all that and more. Daniel Smith - author of 100 Places You Will Never Visit - takes you on an entertaining journey through 100 things you will (probably) never get the chance to do.\nOffering tips and advice on things that you may never be rich enough to do (buy your own island, drink a bottle of 1787 ChÃƒÂ¢teau Lafite, own a Shakespeare first folio); things you might never be brave enough to try (bullfight, base jump from the Burj Khalifa, charm a snake); things you'll hopefully never have to do (escape from Alcatraz, land a 747, play Russian roulette); and even the downright absurd (being in two places at once, making gold, becoming invisible),100 Things You Will Never Do will give you a glimpse of your infinite potential.\n\nAbout the Author\nDaniel Smith is an author and researcher. His books include The Sherlock Holmes Companion, The Lucky BuggerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Casebook, and a history of the Second World War Dig For Victory campaign. He is also a long-time contributor to The StatesmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Yearbook, an annual geopolitical guide to the countries of the world.
