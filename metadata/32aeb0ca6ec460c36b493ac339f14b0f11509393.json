After his first appearance on     |\n|  The Late Show with David Letterman, Letterman himself asked Gaffigan to   |\n|  develop a show for Letterman's production company, World Wide Pants.      |\n|  Although the show, Welcome to New York, didn't work out, Gaffigan's       |\n|  talent was recognized and soon he was making appearances on The Ellen     |\n|  Show, Ed, Law and Order, Sex and the City, and That '70s Show. During     |\n|  this time, Gaffigan released four CDs of his standup on his own label     |\n|  and worked in films, with small roles in Three Kings, Road Trip, and      |\n|  Igby Goes Down. In 2004 he signed a deal with Comedy Central that would   |\n|  include a successful television special and his CD debut for the label,   |\n|  Doin' My Time. The CD included Gaffigan's soon to be famous routine on    |\n|  the dangers of eating Hot Pockets. MP3s of the routine would be attached  |\n|  to numerous e-mails and traded on the Internet before Gaffigan would      |\n|  return in 2006 with his Beyond the Pale CD, DVD, and television special.  |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32aeb0ca6ec460c36b493ac339f14b0f11509393","amp;dn":"Jim_Gaffigan-King_Baby-2009-RVP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32aeb0ca6ec460c36b493ac339f14b0f11509393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,174,176,202,110,196,96,195,107,73,58,195,57,241,75,15,17,80,147,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
