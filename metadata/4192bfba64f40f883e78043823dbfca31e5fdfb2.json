He set out to paint a story through spectral frequencies, beautiful vocals and wistful melodies.\n\nWith our emotions invoked while listening to &quot;Echoes from the Void,&quot; immediatly we see ourselves on the dance floor. Rising inside feeling unable to stand still because Emanuel's sound has enveloped you.\n\nHaving the quality we have come to expect, you will find this album is filled with greater rolling basslines and builds to a faster bpm throughout the album. More so than his previous 3 psychill /GoaChill albums on Altar Records.\n\nThose who have come to know and enjoy the slower beats of classic E-Mantra style, will enjoy this album. It starts out gently in psychill, evolving ever so gradually onto more deeply progressive progressions. All of this being unique to E-Mantra as he continues to craft what inspires him, aka Night Hex nowadays, in the studio...\n\nThank you E-Mantra for the chance to let us enter your single world of magic!\n\nreleased 27 November 2014\n\nW&amp;P By Emanuel Carpus, Romania\n\nTrack 04 with Reasonandu (Alexandru Dumitrescu)\n\nTrack 06 original version by Sundial Aeon (Radoslaw Kochman &amp; Daniel Lulkowski)\n\nArtwork by Olivia Curry\nwww.dreamnectar.com\n\nMastering &amp; layout by Dj Zen @ Altar Records, Qc., Canada\nwww.altar-records.com/mastering.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4192bfba64f40f883e78043823dbfca31e5fdfb2","amp;dn":"E-Mantra+-+Echoes+From+The+Void+%282014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4192bfba64f40f883e78043823dbfca31e5fdfb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,146,191,186,100,244,15,136,62,120,4,56,35,219,252,163,30,95,223,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
