The performance was short, only an hour, but is widely regarded as one of his best.\n\nA unique concert given to the long term inmates of the famous jail. Johnny sings 'Wanted Man' (written especially for the concert by Bob Dylan) and 'San Quentin' (written by Cash just in time for the concert).\n\nSongs:\n\nI Walk the Line\nFolsom Prison Blues\nOrange Blossom Special\nJackson (with June Carter)\nDarlin' Companion (with June Carter)\nDaddy Sang Bass\nSan Quentin\nWanted Man\nA Boy Named Sue\nPeace in the Valley\nHe Turned the Water into Wine\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40febc952ae74e1922893405319de311316d226","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+in+San+Quentin+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40febc952ae74e1922893405319de311316d226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,15,235,201,82,174,116,225,146,40,147,64,83,25,222,49,19,22,210,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
