He wrote the famous book &quot;Brasil, PaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s do Futuro&quot; (Brazil, Country of the Future). He and his wife Lotte, in a mysterious death pact, decided to kill themselves in the week following 1942 Carnival, in Brazil.  (IMDB) Zweig fled Austria in 1934, following Hitler's rise to power in Germany. He then lived in England (in London and from 1939 in Bath) before moving to the United States in 1940. In 1941 he went to Brazil, where in 1942 he and his second wife Charlotte Elisabeth Altmann committed suicide together in PetrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³polis. He had been despairing at the future of Europe and its culture. &quot;I think it better to conclude in good time and in erect bearing a life in which intellectual labour meant the purest joy and personal freedom the highest good on Earth&quot;, he wrote.
