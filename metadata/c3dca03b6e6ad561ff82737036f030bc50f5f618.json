[1]\nBraun attended the Eastman School of Music,[when?] and while a student there became a member of a jazz-fusion band, Auracle. Before embarking on a solo career, Braun got his start by playing in several bands, working as a session musician. Some of the artists with whom he recorded include guitarist Jeff Golub's Avenue Blue. He also collaborated with saxophonist Boney James on a remake of the Hugh Masekela's &quot;Grazing in the Grass.&quot;\nBraun also performs in the band BWB, with saxophonist Kirk Whalum and guitarist Norman Brown. In 2005, he and saxophonist Richard Elliot co-founded ARTizen Music Group (now known as Artistry Music). One of his influences was Freddie Hubbard, and Braun composed a song, &quot;Freddie Was Here&quot; in 2008, which he recorded on his album, All it Takes, in tribute to Hubbard, who died that year.\n\nAlbums:\n1992 - Intimate (320kbps)\n1994 - Christmas (320kbps)\n1994 - Night Walk (9320kbps)\n1995 - Beat Street (9320kbps)\n1997 - Body and Soul (320kbps)\n1998 - Full Stride (320kbps)\n1999 - Best Of Rick Braun (320kbps)\n2001 - Kisses in the Rain (320kbps)\n2003 - Esperanto (320kbps)\n2004 - Sessions Vol. 1 (320kbps)\n2006 - Truly Yours (320kbps)\n2009 - All it Takes (320kbps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3dca03b6e6ad561ff82737036f030bc50f5f618","amp;dn":"Rick+Braun+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3dca03b6e6ad561ff82737036f030bc50f5f618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,220,160,59,110,106,213,97,255,130,115,112,54,240,48,188,80,245,246,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
