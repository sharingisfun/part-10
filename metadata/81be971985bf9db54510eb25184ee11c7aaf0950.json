It clearly and systematically explains underground engineering geology principles, methods, theories and case studies. The authors lay out engineering problems in underground rock engineering and how to study and solve them. The book specially emphasizes mechanical and hydraulic couplings in rock engineering for wellbore stability, mining near aquifers and other underground structures where inflow is a problem.\n\n\n# Paperback: 340 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; Softcover reprint of hardcover 1st ed. 2007 edition (November 23, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 3642092349\n# ISBN-13: 978-3642092343","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81be971985bf9db54510eb25184ee11c7aaf0950","amp;dn":"Engineering+Geology+for+Underground+Rocks+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81be971985bf9db54510eb25184ee11c7aaf0950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,190,151,25,133,191,157,181,69,16,235,37,24,78,225,28,122,175,9,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
