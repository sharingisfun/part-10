EUROPE progressed over the years and I think Prisoners in Paradise is a tight hard rock album with fantastic melodies. Some of my favorite songs were not put out as singles, such as &quot;Girl from Lebanon,&quot; &quot;Mind in the Gutter,&quot; &quot;Bad Blood,&quot; and &quot;7th Sign.&quot; I love Kee Marcello's flying guitar and Mic Michaeli's amazing keyboard solos. They acheived magical new heights within each song that Joey Tempest so brilliantly created. The album showed EUROPE as a solid band and captured each member's talent. This is an album that lacked proper promotion at the time and was very under-appreciated.\nI am glad to learn that Spitfire Records are re-releasing this album with 2 bonus tracks, &quot;Mr. Government Man,&quot; and &quot;Long Time Comin'.&quot; I love &quot;Mr. Government Man&quot; as it reflected the American west influence on EUROPE back in their &quot;Le Baron Boys&quot; days. Sony should have released those LBB demo tracks as they sounded so incredibly powerful and lively! Anyway, if you are looking for some timeless good rock n roll, or if you haven't gotten the PIP album, the new re-issueing version is something you don't want to miss. I know I'll be back for it! Let the EUROPE times rock!! \n\nby Sawa Yukihito\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - All Or Nothing.wma                                          \n02 - Halfway To Heaven.wma                                       \n03 - I'll Cry For You.wma                                        \n04 - Little Bit Of Lovin'.wma                                    \n05 - Talk To Me.wma                                              \n06 - Seventh Sign.wma                                            \n07 - Prisoners In Paradise.wma                                   \n08 - Bad Blood.wma                                               \n09 - Homeland.wma                                                \n10 - Got Your Mind In The Gutter.wma                             \n11 - 'til My Heart Beats Down Your Door.wma                      \n12 - Girl From Lebanon.wma   \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7997ba3d899b4122a774965189da888e3cc81878","amp;dn":"Europe+-+Prisoners+In+Paradise+%281991%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7997ba3d899b4122a774965189da888e3cc81878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,151,186,61,137,155,65,34,167,116,150,81,137,218,136,142,60,200,24,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
