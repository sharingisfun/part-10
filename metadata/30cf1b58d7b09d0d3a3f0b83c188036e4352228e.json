It is an exercise for me to justify my feelings that Silver Jews are the most wonderful band ever. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, I put a full stop. Ha. The man behind Silver Jews is David Berman, a man so mind-blowingly articulate, that half the time it is impossible to comprehend what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saying. He is a lyrical genius. But what about the music, you fool?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been lonely since she found ChristÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever read anything about the Joos, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have seen a consistent name-drop; Pavement. Steven Malkmus is on this album. This album sounds like Pavement. When they were really good. Pavement combined with David Berman. Lush. Berman is a beautiful singer, but at the same time, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the antithesis of his mate Will Oldham. He sings so passionately off-key, he invents a whole new key - the right key. All music that is not made in the key of Silver Jews is wrong. Simple as that.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“No one should have two lives, now you know my middle names are wrong and rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœAmerican WaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ opens with Ã¢â‚¬ËœRandom RulesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a song about adultery. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sad, funny and confusing, just like all the other songs on this album. Did I mention that Berman is a lyrical genius? The next track, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSmith and Jones ForeverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is unrelenting, with BermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals gratingly deep. In both senses of the word.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Are you honest when no oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looking?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBy the third track, Berman already seems to be apologetic for his harsh music. Ã¢â‚¬ËœNight SocietyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an instrumental. BermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is nowhere to be seen, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still brilliant. Steve Malkmus is sharing the vocal duties now. MalkmusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ melodic sweetness and BermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forty-a-day tones, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never work. It does. Damn, this album is good.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I love your amethyst eyes, your protestant thighsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhat does amethyst mean? Who cares. Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlue ArrangementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, like so many of Silver JewsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ songs, is fiercely self-conscious as a piece of music. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pretend to be a pearl of wisdom, just a song in an album full of wonderful songs. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all abstract nonsense. Ã¢â‚¬ËœHonk If YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Lonely TonightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a straight up country and western song. I hate country and western music. I love this song. Each track is a highlight; everything bad about this record just makes it better; the spindly guitars, the directionless lyrics, the hollow harmonies.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t monsters get along with other monsters?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDavid Berman, you are a genius. Silver Jews rule my world. My world is beautiful. Come join me.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30cf1b58d7b09d0d3a3f0b83c188036e4352228e","amp;dn":"Silver+Jews+-+American+Water+%5B1998%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30cf1b58d7b09d0d3a3f0b83c188036e4352228e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,207,27,88,215,176,157,13,58,63,11,131,193,136,3,110,67,82,34,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
