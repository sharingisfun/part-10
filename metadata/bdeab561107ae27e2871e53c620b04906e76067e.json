The DVD resolution is inadequate to differentiate between its being a sprinkler head or a capped-off gas light pipe protruding down from a round base.\n\n    * Continuity: Huck's raft is rammed (at 41:49) by a ship with a high bow, designed for rough/open seas. But when the camera angle changes, we see a typical Mississippi paddle steamer with the characteristically low bow, steaming by the wreckage.\n\n    * Anachronisms: When Huck Finn is walking with Billy Grangerford (at 45:05 to 45:07) to a brick outbuilding where a new slave is chained, you can see the brake lights of a blue mini van in the bottom left quarter of the screen - look to the left of the tree trunk, under the shrubbery.\n\n    * Continuity: When Pap Finn is carrying Huck over his shoulder, down the stairs, we see (at 12:05) looking down from the second floor that the stair landing has a 2-candle sconce on its right wall and its left wall. At 12:11 looking up from the first floor there is no sconce on the right wall of the landing.\n\n\n\nSEED PLEASE!!!
