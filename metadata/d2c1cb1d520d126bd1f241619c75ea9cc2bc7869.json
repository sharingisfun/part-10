Or at least it could be if there was some sort of barrier between your front yard and the sidewalk, or if you didn't have to stare at the back of the neighbors' garage when you want to relax on your patio. \n\nLandscaping for Privacy brims with creative ideas for minimizing or even eliminating the nuisances that intrude on your personal outdoor space. Scores of real-world examples show you how to keep the outside world at bay by strategically placing buffers (such as berms or groups of small trees), barriers (such as fences), and screens (arbors or hedges, for example) around your property. And the helpful plant lists tell you precisely which varieties to choose in order to enhance your sense of seclusion. \n\nIf you've ever felt frustrated by the lack of privacy whenever you step outside your home, this inspiring book will steer you toward an achievable solution.\n\n\nBy Marty Wingate\nPublished by Timber Press in 2011\nEPUB, 152 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c1cb1d520d126bd1f241619c75ea9cc2bc7869","amp;dn":"+Landscaping+for+Privacy%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c1cb1d520d126bd1f241619c75ea9cc2bc7869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,193,203,29,82,13,18,107,209,242,65,97,156,117,234,156,194,188,120,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
