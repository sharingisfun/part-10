White Heart's discography includes thirteen albums, the most recent of which was released in 1997. Original members Billy Smiley and Mark Gersmehl worked with a continually-changing cast of band-mates. In 1985, former roadie Rick Florian became the lead singer.\n\nAlthough White Heart has not officially &quot;retired&quot; as a band, remaining members Smiley, Gersmehl and Florian are each pursuing other interests. Smiley started his own label, Cul-de-Sac Records. Gersmehl continues to write music and has released solo efforts. Florian is a real estate agent in the Franklin, Tennessee area and also continues to sing for various recording projects.\n\nIn Him,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cdaddf67affad72a2d686a21de6800145f42a95","amp;dn":"White+Heart+Discography+1982-2006+%2819+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cdaddf67affad72a2d686a21de6800145f42a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,218,221,246,122,255,173,114,162,214,134,162,29,230,128,1,69,244,42,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
