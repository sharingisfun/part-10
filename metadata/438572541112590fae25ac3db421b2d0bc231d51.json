NISBETT\n\nYEAR: 2003\n\nFORMAT: PDF\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Geography of Thought documents Professor Nisbett's groundbreaking international research in cultural psychology, a series of comparative studies both persuasive in their rigor and startling in their conclusions, addressing questions such as:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Why did the ancient Chinese excel at algebra and arithmetic, but not geometry, the brilliant achievement of such Greeks as Euclid?\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Why do East Asians find it so difficult to disentangle an object from its surroundings?\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Why do Western infants learn nouns more rapidly than verbs, when it is the other way around in East Asia?\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ What are the implications of these cognitive differences for the future of international politics? Do they support a Fukuyamaesque &quot;end of history&quot; scenario or a Huntingtonian &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;?\n\nFrom feng shui to metaphysics, from comparative linguistics to economic history, a gulf separates the children of Aristotle from the descendants of Confucius. \n\nAt a moment in history when the need for cross-cultural understanding and collaboration have never been more important, The Geography of Thought offers both a map to that gulf and a blueprint for a bridge that might be able to span it.\n\n\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\nJUST EXTRACT THE PDF FILE FROM &quot;RAR&quot; FILE TO ENJOY READING THE BOOK..!!\n\nCOMMENT IF U LIKE MY RELEASE...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:438572541112590fae25ac3db421b2d0bc231d51","amp;dn":"Geography+of+thought-how+asians+and+westerners+think+differently","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"438572541112590fae25ac3db421b2d0bc231d51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,133,114,84,17,18,89,15,174,37,172,61,180,33,178,208,188,35,29,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
