Aspiring champions\n Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone), Calamity Jane\n (Mary Woronov), Nero the Hero (Martin Kove), and Matilda the Hun\n (Roberta Collins) are all looking to take the top honors away from \n Frankenstein (David Carradine), a half-man/half-machine who has\n been built to be the best racer on Earth and can outrun and \n outkill anyone on the circuit. However, not everyone likes the \n Death Race, and revolutionary leader Thomasina Paine\n (Harriet Medin) wants to sabotage the event in the name of\n restoring democracy; her plan is to foil Frankenstein&amp;#039;s \n expected victory by smuggling her daughter Annie (Simone Griffeth)\n into Frankenstein&amp;#039;s race car as his navigator. Featuring \n David Carradine at the height of his Kung Fu fame \n (and Sylvester Stallone a year before Rocky), Death Race 2000 \n was a major drive-in hit in 1975; Bartel and Carradine teamed\n up for another road race movie, Cannonball, a year later, and\n a semi-sequel, Death Sport, appeared in 1978.\n\n\n CAST\n ====\n\n David Carradine  - Frankenstein  \n Simone Griffeth  - Annie  \n Sylvester Stallone  - Machine Gun Joe Viterbo  \n Mary Woronov  - Calamity Jane  \n Roberta Collins  - Mathilda The Hun  \n Martin Kove  - Nero the Hero  \n Louisa Moritz  - Myra  \n Fred Grandy  - Herman the German  \n Sandy Ignon  - FBI Agent  \n Joyce Jameson  - Grace Pander  \n John Landis  - Mechanic  \n Paul Laurence  - Special Agent  \n Harriet Medin  - Thomasina Paine  \n Bill Morey  - Deacon  \n Roger Rook  - Radio Operator  \n William Shephard  - Pete  \n Don Steele  - Junior Bruce  \n\n Review\n ======\n Death Race 2000 is the type of bad movie that\n can be very good, or, at least, a whole lot of fun\n -- the formula for a cult classic. It offers a \n surprisingly effective mix of violence, sex, and humor,\n all the more impressive given its modest budget. \n B-movie veteren David Carradine is appropriately gruff \n as the weary Frankenstein, and a pre-Rocky Sylvester Stallone\n is cast with comic perfection as -- what else? -- an Italian thug.\n Rounding out the extensive group of bizarre competitors is\n cult favorite Mary Woronov, as the cowgirl Calamity Jane.\n The gore gets a little excessive, perhaps not surprising given\n that the film was produced by Roger Corman, legendary for \n high-quality, low-budget exploitation films. The movie is not \n entirely without redeeming moral value, however. Like 1987&amp;#039;s\n The Running Man, it does a good job of satirizing the blood lust\n of professional sports and the TV shows that enable and\n encourage it. Maybe this is a film that one shouldn&amp;#039;t think \n too much about. But if you can handle spurious accusations against\n the &quot;treacherous French,&quot; and you don&amp;#039;t mind assigning point values\n to pedestrians, Death Race 2000 is a heck of a trip.\n\n\n \n *******************IMPORTANT ****************************\n\n\tblah blah blah...
