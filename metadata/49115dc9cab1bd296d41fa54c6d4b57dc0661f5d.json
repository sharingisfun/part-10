Creative energy, \n\nfalling in love, entrepreneurship, and even the continued propagation of the human race are driven by this system . . . just as is, unfortunately, the urge to overeat.\nIn The Fix, Dr. Pamela Peeke uses the latest neuroscience to explain how unhealthy food and behavioral Ã¢â‚¬Å“hooksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ have gotten us ensnared; indeed, she shows that dopamine rushes in \n\nthe body work exactly the same way with food as with cocaine. Luckily, we are all capable of rewiring, and the very same dopamine-driven system can be used to reward us for \n\nhealthful, exciting, and fulfilling activities. The Fix makes this possible by laying out a lifelong, 3-stage plan that starts with a 3- to 4-week jump start to break so-called \n\nheinous hooks and replace them with healthier actions. Fitness guides, meal plans, and recipes are constructed to bolster the growth of new neurons and stimulate the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\nreward system. Gradually, healthy hooks like playing games, meditating, having sex, going for a run, laughing, and learning a new language will replace the junk food, couch \n\ntime, and other bad habits that leave us unhappy and overweight.\n\n\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Health","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49115dc9cab1bd296d41fa54c6d4b57dc0661f5d","amp;dn":"Pam+Peeke+-+The+Hunger+Fix+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49115dc9cab1bd296d41fa54c6d4b57dc0661f5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,17,93,201,202,177,189,41,109,65,250,84,198,212,181,125,192,102,31,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
