Michael's agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack) can't even get his client a commercial since Michael complained that the tomato he was playing wasn't properly motivated. &quot;You were a tomato!&quot; screams George in desperation, adding that Michael is so obnoxious that he will probably never work again. Dorsey thinks otherwise; when he hears of an opening on a popular soap opera, he applies for the job--even though the job is for a woman. Posing as &quot;Miss Dorothy Michaels,&quot; Michael wins the part and becomes a widely-known actress. Yet complications ensue when Michael falls for his co-star Julie (Jessica Lange, in an Oscar-winning performance) but, as Dorothy, is courted by Julie's widowed father (Charles Durning). Michael ultimately finds that his disguise as a woman has made him a better man. One of the classic comedies of the 1980s, Tootsie's gender-bending premise boasts a screenplay by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, and by a host of memorable supporting comic performances from Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, George Gaynes, and Bill Murray. Future Oscar-winner Geena Davis makes her screen debut as a daytime drama queen, which indeed she had been before Tootsie came along. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:51:44\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x304 2.37:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1561 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,29 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b736c5bdf72953c0f874c2205865e85e2022fe63","amp;dn":"Tootsie+%281982%29+Dustin+Hoffman+Eng-multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b736c5bdf72953c0f874c2205865e85e2022fe63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,54,197,189,247,41,83,192,248,116,194,32,88,101,232,94,32,34,254,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
