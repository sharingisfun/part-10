Also their 1968 CBS album Three In A Cell was for many years a charity shop staple, suggesting that its popularity at the time had been followed by exile into the world of the unfashionable. But it was Suite London which showcased a style of atmospherics on the slow tracks that saw their version of Alan Lerner's &quot;On A Clear Day&quot; being sampled by freak funk outfit and London club pioneers Sandals for their 1992 single &quot;Nothing&quot;. However it was the strange combination of The Peddlers with The London Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded as their final album with the band's original line-up, that was the true find.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d708921cd5b5ce9546f241d4bc904232a77b4226","amp;dn":"The+Peddlers+and+The+London+Philharmonic+Orchestra+-+Suite+Londo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d708921cd5b5ce9546f241d4bc904232a77b4226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,8,146,28,213,181,206,149,70,242,65,212,188,144,66,50,167,123,66,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
