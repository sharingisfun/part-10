It includes two chapters presenting essential examples of these cucurbituril-based structures, depending on the types of non covalent interactions and inducer species. It also includes one chapter dealing with the utilization of cucurbiturils as a molecular container in supramolecular chemistry and demonstrating a wide range of potential applications of supramolecular assemblies with cucurbiturils in catalysis, separation, absorption and polymer materials. The book offers an interesting and valuable guide for readers working in the areas of supramolecular chemistry and materials.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (March 25, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3662466287\nISBN-13: 978-3662466285\n\nEditorial Reviews\nAbout the Author\n\nXin-Long Ni received his PhD from Saga University (Japan) in 2011.
