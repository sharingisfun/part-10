Like its predecessor, Nuthin' Fancy, Skynyrd's fourth release didn't produce a hit single like its first couple of albums had, but there were several songs that subsequently became standards for the band. Highlights include the album-opening title track, which captures Skynyrd at their toughest, powered on by muscular guitar riffing courtesy of Gary Rossington and the late Allen Collins, as well as &quot;Searching,&quot; the latter being included later in the year on One More From The Road.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
