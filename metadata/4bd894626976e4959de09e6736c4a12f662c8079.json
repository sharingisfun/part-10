In essence, it is a love story and a marvelously insightful account of their years together, beginning with their initial meeting when Fraser was the wife of a member of Parliament and mother of six, and Pinter was married to a distinguished actress. Over the years, they experienced much joy, a shared devotion to their work, crises and laughter, and, in the end, great courage and love as Pinter battled the illness to which he eventually sucÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­cumbed on Christmas Eve 2008.\n\nMust You Go? is based on FraserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recollections and on the diaries she has kept since October 1968. She shares PinterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own revelations about his past, as well as observations by his friends. FraserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s diariesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½written by a biographer living with a creative artist and observing the process firsthandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½also proÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­vide a unique insight into his writing.\n\nHarold Pinter and Antonia Fraser lived together from August 1975 until his death thirty-three years later. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œO! call back yesterday, bid time return,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ cries one of the courtiers to Richard II. This is Antonia FraserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s uniquely compelling way of doing so.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd894626976e4959de09e6736c4a12f662c8079","amp;dn":"My+Life+with+Harold+Pinter+-+Antonia+Fraser++%28MOBI+%2F+ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd894626976e4959de09e6736c4a12f662c8079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,216,148,98,105,118,228,149,157,224,158,103,54,196,161,47,102,44,128,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
