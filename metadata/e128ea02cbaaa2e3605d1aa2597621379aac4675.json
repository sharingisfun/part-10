They were led by singer, songwriter and guitarist Arthur Lee and the group's second songwriter, guitarist Bryan MacLean. One of the first racially diverse American pop bands, their music reflected different influences, combining elements of rock and roll, garage rock, folk and psychedelia.\nToday, the band's critical reputation exceeds the limited success they experienced during their time, their 1967 album Forever Changes being held in particularly high regard. The band's influence extends beyond the realm of 60s psychedelia to such punk and post-punk bands as Television Personalities and The Jesus and Mary Chain. William Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain wore a Love t-shirt in his band's video for &quot;Head On&quot; from their Automatic album. The Damned covered &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; on the album Anything. Love have also influenced many 1960s-inspired Top 40 UK acts, including The Stone Roses, The Bluetones, Shack, The Stands, Primal Scream and Ricky, whose critically acclaimed mini-album, 'You Set The Scene' was named after a song on Forever Changes.\nLed Zeppelin's Robert Plant cites Forever Changes as one of his favorite albums ever.\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nDISC 1\n \n1.
