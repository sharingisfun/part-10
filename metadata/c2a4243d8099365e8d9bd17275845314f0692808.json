An unnerving tale of a narcotics addict unmoored in New York, Tangiers, and, ultimately, a nightmarish wasteland known as Interzone. The restored text includes many editorial corrections and incorporates Burroughs s notes on the text and several essays he wrote over the years about the book. For the Burroughs enthusiast and neophyte alike, this is a valuable and fresh experience of this classic of our culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a4243d8099365e8d9bd17275845314f0692808","amp;dn":"Naked+Lunch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a4243d8099365e8d9bd17275845314f0692808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,164,36,61,128,153,54,94,141,155,209,114,117,132,83,20,240,105,40,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
