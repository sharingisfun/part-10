Simply download the 800 MB-worth of files frominstall the app, run your Desktop Manager, upgrade your OS, and voila! Now you can use any SIM card in your BlackBerry. Just make sure your vendor.xml file is deleted in the apploader folder, Desktop Manager 4.7.0.32 is installed, and you have your OS properly installed.\n\nThis is ideal for those hankering to use the BlackBerry Storm (either 9500 or 9530) on their existing GSM carrier, but of course MFI Multiloader will let you unlock your BlackBerry Pearl (8100, 8110, 8120 and 8130), BlackBerry Curve (8300, 8310, 8320, 8330, and maybe even 8350i), the old 8800 series (8800, 8820, 8830), as well as the new BlackBerry Bold 9000, and the BlackBerry Pearl Flip 8220.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.gsmhosting.com/vbb/showthread.php?t=644060&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.gsmhosting.com/vbb/showthread.php?t=644060&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3baa20897b0e395c3d8416307f3a5c0598456b","amp;dn":"MFI+Multiloader+Complete+v+2.0.1.3+10+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3baa20897b0e395c3d8416307f3a5c0598456b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,59,170,32,137,123,14,57,92,61,132,22,48,127,58,92,5,152,69,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
