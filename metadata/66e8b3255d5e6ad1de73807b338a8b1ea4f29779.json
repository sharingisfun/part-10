It was William Hartnell's last regular appearance as the First Doctor, and the first story to feature the Cybermen. Patrick Troughton also makes his first, uncredited appearance as the Second Doctor. Only three of the four episodes are held in the BBC archives; one remains missing, though this was recreated using animation for the DVD release of the story in 2013.\n\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 872 kbps\nResolution: 640 x 480 (4:3 aspect ratio)\n\nAUDIO: AAC @ 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e8b3255d5e6ad1de73807b338a8b1ea4f29779","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+The+Tenth+Planet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e8b3255d5e6ad1de73807b338a8b1ea4f29779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,232,179,37,93,94,106,209,222,115,128,123,51,138,139,30,164,242,151,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
