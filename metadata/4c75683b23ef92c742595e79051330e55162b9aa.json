His various targets include nature (I\\&amp;#039;ve never trusted the sea. What\\&amp;#039;s it hiding under there?), the Hollywood Blacklist (I would have named enough names to fill the Moscow phone book), and atheists (Imagine going through life completely duped into thinking that there\\&amp;#039;s no invisible, omniscient higher power guiding every action on Earth. It\\&amp;#039;s just so arbitrary!). Colbert also provides helpful illustrations and charts (Things That Are Trying to Turn Me Gay) [and] a complete transcript of his infamous speech at the 2006 White House Correspondents\\&amp;#039; Dinner [...] all of which add up to a book that is sure to be a bestseller and match the success of Colbert\\&amp;#039;s former Daily Show boss Jon Stewart\\&amp;#039;s America (The Book).
