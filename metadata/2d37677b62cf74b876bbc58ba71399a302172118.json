Accepting the quest in order to regain his kingdom, Jason assembled a legendary crew including many of Greece's greatest heroes such as Hercules, Orpheus, Atalanta, Telamon, and the twins Castor and Pollux.\nWith this band of heroes and demi-gods, Jason set sail in the Argo on a journey across the known world. During their quest, the Argonauts faced numerous challenges including the harpies, the clashing rocks, the Sirens, Talos the bronze man, the sleepless dragon that guarded the fleece, and of course the fickle will of the gods of Olympus.\n\nDr. Neil Smith retells this classic myth, examining its origins, its history, and its continued popularity. The text is supported by numerous illustrations both classical and modern, including numerous artwork plates especially commissioned for this work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d37677b62cf74b876bbc58ba71399a302172118","amp;dn":"Jason.and.the.Argonauts.Myths.and.Legends.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d37677b62cf74b876bbc58ba71399a302172118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,55,103,123,98,207,116,184,118,187,197,139,167,19,153,163,2,23,33,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
