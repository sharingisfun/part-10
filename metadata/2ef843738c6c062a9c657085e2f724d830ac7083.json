The title track to this six song EP continues much in the same vein as 2004?s exceptional Our Endless Numbered Days. Recorded with Red Red Meat alum Brian Deck, Woman King subtly opens the sonic palette up to include more percussion, piano, and wait is that an electric guitar? &quot;Grey Stables&quot; and &quot;Evening on the Ground,&quot; have gorgeous fiddle playing, while the pacing and multi-limbed percussion of those songs and &quot;Freedom Hangs Like Heaven&quot; are very Allman Brothers (that?s a good thing.) It?s not all slowly stewing nouveau Southern rock, however. The sweet, vocal-fueled &quot;Jezebel&quot; would easily have fit on the first album, while the lovely ballad &quot;In My Lady?s House&quot; demonstrates further why siblings should sing together, as Sam and sister Sarah hit ideal harmonies. --Mike McGonigal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ef843738c6c062a9c657085e2f724d830ac7083","amp;dn":"Iron+and+Wine+-+Woman+King+%5BEP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ef843738c6c062a9c657085e2f724d830ac7083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,248,67,115,140,108,6,42,156,101,112,133,226,247,36,216,48,172,112,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
