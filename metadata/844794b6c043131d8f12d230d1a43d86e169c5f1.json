Betty secretly loved Boris, but could not find her father's wishes, so she was married off to a gold digger. Boris gave up his dreams and took over the family's undertaking business in their small town. Everything has remained status quo in their lives until Betty's mother-in-law dies. Boris and Betty are thrust together again and as they discuss the funeral arrangements for Betty's mother-in-law, the old spark is re-kindled. Her funeral will be held at Plotz Funeral Homes, much to the chagrin of the funeral director, Frank Featherbed. An America, Featherbed is determined to revolutionize the undertaking business in Whales through the innovation of &quot;theme&quot; funerals. Betty and Boris discover that the only obstacle between their love for one another is Betty's marriage to the two-timing mayor. In a desperate Bid for Happiness, Boris and Betty decide to stage her death and run away together. Meanwhile Featherbed is holding his first funeral--done much to the surprise of the bereaved, in a Star Trek theme. During the service, Featherbed's assistant operates the special effects that produce smoke and music. However, when he pushed the switch that raises the coffin for the &quot;beamed up&quot; effect, the switch sticks and the coffin breaks through the roof! Boris pursues the plan for faking Betty's death by enlisting the help of the town doctor. But still, nothing goes as planned, and so the comedy begins.\n\nAlso known as: Bailando en el cementerio, GrabgeflÃƒÂ¼ster, TÃƒÂºmulo com Vista, Bailando en el cementerio, GrabgeflÃƒÂ¼ster - Liebe versetzt SÃƒÂ¤rge, Funerarias, S.A., NeljÃƒÂ¤t Hautajaiset &amp; Yhdet HÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤t, NeljÃƒÂ¤t hautajaiset ja hÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤t, L'amour, six pieds sous terre, 4 kideies gia 1 gamo, SÃƒÂ­rhely kilÃƒÂ¡tÃƒÂ¡ssal - Nincs eskÃƒÂ¼vÃ…â€˜, csak temetÃƒÂ©s, Bara con vista, Zakopana Betty, A Morte Soube-nos TÃƒÂ£o Bem, Begravda hemligheter, ÃÂ§ÃÂµÃ‘â€šÃÂ²ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾ ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¾Ã‘â€¦ÃÂ¾Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾ÃÂ½ ÃÂ¸ ÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂ½ÃÂ° Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ²ÃÂ°ÃÂ´Ã‘Å’ÃÂ±ÃÂ°. \nCountry: UK, USA, Germany\nStudio: Snowfall Films, Great British Films, Spice Factory, CF1 Cyf, Telepool, Scion Films, Dream Fish Productions, Enterprise Films, Plotz with a View Ltd, Vine International Pictures, Investing in Enterprise Ltd.\nDuration: 01:32:49\n\nInfo:\n\n[mediainfo]\n\nVideo\nID                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP       : 1\nFormat settings, QPel       : No\nFormat settings, GMC        : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix     : Default (MPEG)\nCodec ID                    : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint               : XviD\nDuration                    : 1h 32mn\nBit rate                    : 2 179 Kbps\nWidth                       : 704 pixels\nHeight                      : 528 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio        : 4:3\nFrame rate                  : 25.000 fps\nColor space                 : YUV\nChroma subsampling          : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression mode            : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.234\nStream size                 : 1.41 GiB (83%)\nWriting library             : XviD 73\n\nAudio\nID                          : 1\nFormat                      : AC-3\nFormat/Info                 : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension              : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID                    : 2000\nDuration                    : 1h 32mn\nBit rate mode               : Constant\nBit rate                    : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 6 channels\nChannel positions           : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                   : 16 bits\nCompression mode            : Lossy\nStream size                 : 297 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                   : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration        : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duratio : 500 ms\n\n\n[/mediainfo]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844794b6c043131d8f12d230d1a43d86e169c5f1","amp;dn":"Undertaking+Betty+%2F+Plots+with+a+View+2002+DVDRip+Naomi+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844794b6c043131d8f12d230d1a43d86e169c5f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,71,148,182,192,67,19,29,143,18,210,48,209,164,61,134,225,105,197,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
