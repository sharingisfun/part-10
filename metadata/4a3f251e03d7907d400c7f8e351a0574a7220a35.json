What one might notice is that all of the major hits (&quot;You Dropped a Bomb on Me,&quot; &quot;Burn Rubber on Me,&quot; &quot;Early in the Morning,&quot; and &quot;I Don't Believe You Want to Get up and Dance&quot;) all sound surprisingly similar. \nThis may or may not be a large surprise to everyone, but the bright note about their similarity is that the basic riffs and rhythms that they all use are extremely catchy. The energy that the Gap Band exudes in the midst of producing a song is stunning, and this compilation displays that to the fullest extent. For a basic introduction to the forms of funk that the Gap Band followed, this album would certainly suit any given listener. \nFor those who only need one Gap Band album in their collection, this one also fits the bill perfectly. For die-hard fans who already have all of the band's albums, this one would probably only really serve as a summary.
