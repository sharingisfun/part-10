EQUO is particularly suited to live or automated tweaking during a performance. The main display contains both the EQ (VOL) and EQ (PAN) controls so that sounds can not only be shaped according to frequency content, but panning can be applied on specific frequency basis.\nFurther, One Master EQ shape and then a further 8 separate EQ/PAN shapes may be set and then these EQ shapes can be smoothly morphed using the Morph knob. An alternative to EQUO is Parametric EQ 2.\n\nFlangus VSTi allows you to enrich the stereo panorama of your mix, add complex flange effects and simulate unison mode synthesis via a set of controllable 'stacked' flangers.\n\nLove Philter VSTi consists of eight identical filter units, each able to be fed to the next one in the chain. It can create complex delay, gating and filtering effects.\n\nMultiband Compressor VSTi is a three band stereo compressor using ButterWorth IIR or LinearPhase FIR filters to separate the incoming signal into three bands for processing. Limiter functionality is also included.\n\nParametric EQ VSTi is a CPU friendly 7 band parametric equalizer plugin. You can adjust the frequency and width of each band in the EQ. Also, each band can act as high shelf, low shelf, peaking, band pass, notch, high pass or low pass filter. The plugin also contains global gain wheel to adjust the overall volume.\n\nParametric EQ 2 VSTi is an advanced 7-band parametric equalizer plugin with spectral analysis. The band type and the frequency and width of each band are fully adjustable. You can choose from High Shelf, Low Shelf, Peaking, Band Pass, Notch, Low Pass, High Pass or Band Pass filters for each band independently. There is also a global gain slider to adjust the overall volume.\n\nSpectroman VSTi is a spectrum analyser plugin. It behaves like a row of peak meters, from low to high frequencies. The louder the frequency, the higher the bar will peak. A sonograph is a rolling display of the intensity plotted as a chart. Low frequencies are plotted on the left through to high frequencies on the right (Edison has a much larger and higher-resolution capability for this type of display on sampled data). The louder the particular frequency the brighter the trace on the screen. This plugin is useful (when mixing) for checking the frequency distribution of your mix.\n\nStereo Enhancer VSTi contains various filters and processors to alter and enrich the stereo image of the input sound.\n\nVocoder VSTi is an advanced real-time vocoder effect with a wide range of adjustable parameters and zero latency. Vocoding is the process of using the frequency spectrum of one sound to modulate the same in another. When a human voice is used to modulate a synthesized chord, for example, it can sound like the synthesizer is talking (a classic robot voice from sci-fi).\n\nWave Candy VSTi is a flexible audio analysis and visualization tool including an Oscilloscope, Spectrum Analyser and Peak Meter. The display type, colors, frequency range and dynamic range are fully customizable.\n\nWaveShaper VSTi is a wave distortion effect which maps input (horizontal axis) to output (vertical axis) values using flexible spline-based graph.\n\nsee more @ http://www.image-line.com/plugins/category/Juice+Pack/\n\n\n            Image-Line.Maximus.v1.0.20.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n\nMaximus will deliver transparent peak limiting and volume maximization without coloration of the processed sound. However, Maximus is much more than a pristine quality Mastering Maximizer, it's also a Compressor, Limiter, Noise Gate, Expander, Ducker and De-esser. Maximus excels equally well as a final mastering plugin or as a per-track effect.
