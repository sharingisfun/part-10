The novel achieved huge popularity and was hailed as a classic war novel. Many believed that the novel was realistic because John Hersey had been a war correspondent in Italy during the war. The book is rich in characterization, and it is recognized as a classic study in leadership. Another possible reason it was so well received was that the novel portrays the American army in a positive light and shows how democracy is inherently superior to Fascism.
