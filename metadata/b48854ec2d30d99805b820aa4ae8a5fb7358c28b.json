He loses heart and quits the movement and goes to London trying to leave the U.K. and start a new life. The IRA wants him back (he knows too much) and the local crime boss, Meehan, will only help him if he performs one last hit, on a rival crime boss. When Fallon does perform the hit, he is seen by a catholic priest. He refuses to kill an innocent again and must find a way to escape the police without killing the priest who can identify him.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093771/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093771/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-93771/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-93771/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x400  16/9\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1691 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,26 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48854ec2d30d99805b820aa4ae8a5fb7358c28b","amp;dn":"A+Prayer+for+the+Dying+%281987%29+Mickey+Rourke++Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48854ec2d30d99805b820aa4ae8a5fb7358c28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,136,84,236,45,48,217,152,5,184,32,170,74,232,165,251,115,88,194,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
