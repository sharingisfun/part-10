Here lie the foundations of his unique genius&quot;--from the foreword by Peter Ackroyd. &quot;I have a new story...&quot;--when Oscar Wilde uttered those words, even his enemies leaned in close to listen, for his legendary wit and wisdom enchanted everyone in person as on the printed page. (Some even thought he was better in conversation than in writing.) For the first time, a century after his death, a collection of Wilde's spoken stories reveals the true scope of his genius. 42 bite-size literary gems shine with humor, intelligence, and surprising twists and turns. Some were set on paper by Wilde himself, others were jotted down by friends, family, and guests at Wilde's table. Painstakingly researched, each with an illuminating introduction, and illustrated with prints and photographs of the period, these tales weave pure magic. They include modern stories and anecdotes, fantasies (often based on Irish folktales), biblical sagas, and prose poems. A treasured invitation to &quot;dinner&quot; with Wilde that no lover of literature would miss!\n\nWritten by Oscar Wilde \nRead by Tom Baker \nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 192 Kbps \nUnabridged \n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents. ;)\n_______________________________\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&lt;/a&gt;\n_______________________________\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n\n                                                      (:__Abee \t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a56892054b3d81004506fc7fa47a357143e41e7d","amp;dn":"%28Classics%29+Oscar+Wilde+-+Table+Talk+Read+by+Tom+Baker+-+Abee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a56892054b3d81004506fc7fa47a357143e41e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,104,146,5,75,61,129,0,69,6,252,127,164,122,53,113,67,228,30,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
