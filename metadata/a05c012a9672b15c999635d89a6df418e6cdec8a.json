Geils Band is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Worcester, Massachusetts, under the leadership of guitarist J. Geils.\n\n The band played R&amp;B-influenced blues rock in the 1970s before moving towards a more new wave sound in the 1980s. Since its initial break-up in 1985, the band has reunited several times.\n\n Their biggest hit was their 1981 single, &quot;Centerfold&quot;, which charted No. 1 in the United States in early 1982.\n\n The band started as an acoustic blues trio in the mid 1960s, with vocalist and guitarist John Geils, bassist Danny Klein (Dr. Funk) and harmonica player Richard Salwitz (stage name Magic Dick).\n\n The band formed under the name 'Snoopy and the Sopwith Camels', while Geils was attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute for a couple of semesters. In 1967, the band switched focus, starting to play electric guitar and bass and recruiting drummer Stephen Jo Bladd and fast-talking ex-disc jockey singer Peter Wolf, born Peter Blankenfeld, (originally from the Bronx ) and later, both from Boston. They became the J. Geils Blues Band, later dropping the word &quot;Blues&quot; from the band name. The following year, former fan Seth Justman joined as an organist. The group signed to Atlantic Records in 1970.\n\n Although living in Boston, the band had always considered Detroit its second home because of its enormous popularity there. Two of its three live albums were recorded in Detroit at the Cinderella Ballroom and Pine Knob Music Theater (now DTE Energy Music Theater). Their second live album, 1976's Blow Your Face Out, was recorded in Boston (at Boston Garden) and Detroit (at Cobo Arena).\n\n The J. Geils Band first received FM radio airplay with the live single cover version of The Contours' &quot;First I Look at the Purse&quot;. They then began to get AM radio airplay as well with a series of several hit singles in the 1970s, the most successful of which were a cover version of The Valentinos' &quot;Lookin' for a Love&quot; (1971), a cover version of The Showstoppers' &quot;Ain't Nothin' But a Houseparty&quot; (1973), &quot;Give it to Me&quot; (1973), and &quot;Must Of Got Lost&quot; (1974). Later in the 1970s, the band signed with EMI America Records.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand Members:\n\nJ.
