Jake&amp;#039;s brother is fighting for the kickboxing championship of Thailand and wins his bout. Jake and Schot leave the arena victorious and are soon attacked by Khan and his henchmen. Khan takes Schot on in a fight and subsequently kills him. He then attacks Jake and leaves him scarred for life.\n\nTen years later, Jake is a police officer, fighting crime in New York city. Jake is given a special assignment by his commanding officer Captain O&amp;#039;Day (played by Richard Jaeckal). His Captain tells him that there are filmmakers in Thailand who kill the actors on the set of their films. Jake is to travel to Thailand to stop them. Jake refuses but changes his mind when he later finds out that Khan is involved.\n\nJake travels to Thailand and meets a kickboxer who convinces Jake that he is no match for Khan. He tells him about Prang, a man who may be able to help him. Prang was once one of Thailand&amp;#039;s top fighters but now lives a recluse in the wilderness. Jake finds Prang and Prang agrees to train Jake.\n\nKhan tries to rape a young lady called Molly (played by Sherrie Rose). She escapes but is chased by some of Khan&amp;#039;s thugs. Jake witnesses the chase and saves Molly. Jake then befriends Molly.\n\nJake continues to train with Prang and perfects his skills. He develops an intimate relationship with Molly. Jake attracts the attention of the filmakers he is suppose to be investigating and scores a role in a film.\n\nJake leaves Prang&amp;#039;s abode and heads for the film set. This gives Khan and his thugs a chance to kill Prang and kidnap Molly. Jake arrives on the film set and goes through several scenes before Khan appears. Khan throws Prang&amp;#039;s lifeless body into the water below and throws Molly into a net and traps her.\n\nThe final fight then takes place between Jake and Khan. Jake defeats Khan and subsequently kills him. He rescues Molly and the police move in to arrest the corrupt film makers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d3f26756a0d50c9e12d32bc806f9a558a7542f2","amp;dn":"The+King+of+the+Kickboxers+%28divx%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d3f26756a0d50c9e12d32bc806f9a558a7542f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,63,38,117,106,13,80,201,225,45,50,188,128,111,154,85,138,117,66,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
