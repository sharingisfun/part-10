Most of us are relatively happy, but we are also aware of a deep sense that we could be happier. We believe happiness will come when we reach certain goals in our lives like getting married, buying a new home, getting a raise, a promotion, or a new job. So we forego a little happiness today and this week so we can reach those goals sooner. Our challenge is the days and weeks turn into months and years. The goals we thought would make us happy turn out to be just milestones on a long journey, and our happiness does not materialize like we had hoped. Happiness in the form of a deep sense of contentment, satisfaction, and fulfillment seems to be missing.

In the name of Ã¢â‚¬Å“success,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ many miss life altogether, its lessons, its experiences and its simple pleasures.\n\nIn this book, Ray shows that happiness actually comes before success, not after it. He spells out how the two are eternally bound, and he walks you through a methodology that will change the way you think about success, and life.\n\nRay lives a life of clarity and conviction.

Most of us are relatively happy people, but we are also well aware that we could be happier. There is a belief - thanks to society - that once we hit a certain amount of success in a raise, promotion, or a brand new job that we will hit a level of happiness that comes along with that. The truth is we can be happy now; chasing success for the sake of being happy is not a strategy that works. Look at a solid guide that will help you be happier now and find success through that happiness.\n\nI admit I have been one of those people lately, hoping that once I hit a certain stride in my freelance writing career that I will be happier. Ray White has written a book that shed so much light onto changing my outlook. I honestly can see where I was going wrong and his guide opened my eyes wide. The book flows well and the steps are written out in a way that is so easy to implement I am going to be starting today. While the book is educational, it does not just spout the facts and keep them cold; it is engaging and the tone is friendly, which is something I responded to well. Out of the self help books I have read, I must say this is one of the best. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for some answers.\nReview by Mamta Madhavan - 5 stars Reviewed By Mamta Madhavan for ReadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Favorite\n\nConnecting Happiness and Success: A Guide to Creating Success Through Happiness by Ray White is a good book that will guide readers in discovering happiness and success on a daily basis.

In twenty-two detailed chapters, White examines what happiness really is, why it is important to success and how to get it. A sound theory based on extensive research proves that happiness leads to success. While the two concepts are interrelated, workaholics show that hard work achieves goals, but does not necessarily make people happy. Focusing on a plan for happiness provides the motivation, positive habits and energy needed to feel satisfied, content and fulfilled. Throughout the book are seven concepts aimed at helping victims of the rat-race change their way of thinking. WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awe-inspiring reflection on a common problem plaguing society takes a fresh look at the daily practices that can lead to happiness. Used as a tool for success, this manual includes chapter exercises that assist in aligning values, visualizing dreams, measuring goals and living a higher purpose.\n\nRay White in Connecting Happiness and Success: A Guide to Creating Success through Happiness inspires a powerful self-reflection, resulting in a personal inventory of authentic mindfulness.

Pick up a copy of Connecting Happiness and Success by Ray White to choose happiness and become an instant success.\n\nReview by Teodora Totorean - 5 stars Reviewed By Teodora Totorean for ReadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Favorite\n\nConnecting Happiness and Success by Ray White starts from the premise that happiness hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got anything to do with money and the idea of success is relative, depending on what people want from life. Many surveys show that money doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make people happy but activities that serve a higher purpose make them feel authentic. White deconstructs the myth of happiness through material things as well as measuring happiness through frugal pleasures. Understanding the difference between pleasure and happiness; taking control of their lives by doing things they want to do and not things that family, friends and society expect them to do; finding a higher purpose and working daily towards it - these are the necessary steps that anyone can take in order to achieve happiness. As for success, this is relative as everyone has their own definition of success, but the idea is that people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to wait until that moment comes in order to be happy; they can use their happiness as a tool to achieve success.\n\nConnecting Happiness and Success by Ray White is enjoyable and easy to read, written in a conversational tone. There are many case studies and examples from real people as well as from studies that help clarify some ideas within the book. The chapters are well organized and there are many exercises throughout the book that help readers implement the concepts explained in each chapter. I particularly enjoyed the chapters about how to exercise your will power and how to form a new habit, and the exercises that accompany them are more than useful. I recommend this book to anyone who feels that there is more to life than their career or material goals, as well as to anyone who wants to change their life for the better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07648de4bcd4e386faf9feecfe1268f5f8670fe1","amp;dn":"Connecting+Happiness+and+Succes+-+Ray+White","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07648de4bcd4e386faf9feecfe1268f5f8670fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,100,141,228,188,212,227,134,250,249,254,236,254,18,104,245,248,103,15,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
