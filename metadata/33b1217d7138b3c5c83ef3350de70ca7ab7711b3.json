Great Playing, Great Tunes, Great Sound &quot;No Apologies&quot; needed!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nJazz Guitarist John Basile and StringTime Jazz return to the roots and present a soulful organ based collection of standards, originals, latin, and 70's pop tunes in a new CD release entitled &quot;No Apologies&quot;. For this project we wanted to approach the music, choice of musicians, and conception totally from an organic (figuratively and literally), back to basics approach, and work with material that I felt was complete in representing my experience in all styles of music over the years&quot;. &quot;No Apologies&quot;, features Pat Bianchi on the organ and Carmen Intorre on drums , two of the most exciting voices in modern jazz today. The music incorporates the rich tradition of organ based, straight-ahead jazz with a contemporary approach that results in an entertaining, no nonsense blend of material guaranteed to satisfy any listener.\n\n--------\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows). This is in order to make the path (drive, directory and filename) as short as possible. Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors.\n\n--------\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33b1217d7138b3c5c83ef3350de70ca7ab7711b3","amp;dn":"John+Basile+-+No+Apologies+-+Jazz+Guitar%2C+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33b1217d7138b3c5c83ef3350de70ca7ab7711b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,177,33,125,113,56,179,197,200,62,243,53,13,231,12,167,171,119,17,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
