To catch a serial killer, he needs to stay focused, yet all he can think about is the feisty, long-legged coed whose guarded nature intrigues him\n\nA matter of lies...\nDeceived and hurt before, Rachel would rather be a single, crazy cat lady than trust another guy, especially a gorgeous, tattooed bad boy with a Harley, like Kash. But when his liquid-steel eyes meet hers, it takes all of Rachel's will-power to stop herself from exploring his hot body with her own.\n\nA matter of love...\nAs much as they try to keep it platonic, the friction between them sparks an irresistible heat that soon consumes them. Can Kash keep Rachel's heart and her life safe even as he risks his own? Will she be able to forgive his lies ... or will she run when she discovers the dangerous truth?\n\nGenre: New Adult Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c09168c46a0336679c97325b8d8e29bc6a96c7a","amp;dn":"Forgiving+Lies+-+McAdams%2C+Molly.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c09168c46a0336679c97325b8d8e29bc6a96c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,9,22,140,70,160,51,102,121,201,115,37,184,216,226,155,198,169,108,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
