After a pair of successful \nalbums like 2002&amp;#039;s tremendously popular triple platinum The \nYoung and the Hopeless and 2004&amp;#039;s subsequent million-selling \nfollow-up The Chronicles of Life and Death (which were \nrealized with producer Eric Valentine), GC singer Joel Madden \nsays its modus operandi on GOOD MORNING REVIVAL (Epic/Daylight) \nwas simply to &quot;make a record that we loved and that felt good.&quot; \nThe first monster single is &quot;The River&quot; a collaboration with M. \nShadows &amp; Synyster Gates.\n\nDeluxe edition with two bonus tracks. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6720e3667e05fb724f6b5291d2af764192e09655","amp;dn":"Good_Charlotte-Good_Morning_Revival-2007-SAW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6720e3667e05fb724f6b5291d2af764192e09655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,32,227,102,126,5,251,114,79,107,82,145,210,175,118,65,146,224,150,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
