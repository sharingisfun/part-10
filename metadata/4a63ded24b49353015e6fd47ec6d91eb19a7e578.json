It's a game plan to get off the default path, turn the tables on the banks, airlines, hotels, cell phone companies and retailers and emerge victorious in the great game being played for your hard earned cash. \nWritten by Brad Wilson, founder of BradsDeals.com, the largest editorial-driven deal website, the book provides tips, strategy and real-life examples of things he has personally done over the past 10 years as a professional bargain hunter. Learn how he: \nEarned 5m frequent flyer miles, all on the ground \nStayed two weeks in one of the nicest hotels in Europe for free \nMoved his credit score from 400 to almost 800 \nFound discounts on new cars of up to 25% off \nThe entire basis for thinking about how best to shop, spend, travel, bank--essentially all aspects of being a consumer--has fundamentally changed. The power is now in your hands, and Do More, Spend Less shows you how to win as a consumer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a63ded24b49353015e6fd47ec6d91eb19a7e578","amp;dn":"Do+More%2C+Spend+Less+-+Brad+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a63ded24b49353015e6fd47ec6d91eb19a7e578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,99,222,210,75,73,53,48,21,230,253,71,236,109,145,235,25,167,229,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
