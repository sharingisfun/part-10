When their father has a health scare, they return to their childhood home in Cincinnati to helpâ€”and discover that the sprawling Tudor they grew up in is crumbling and the family is in disarray.\r\n\r\nYoungest sisters Kitty and Lydia are too busy with their CrossFit workouts and Paleo diets to get jobs. Mary, the middle sister, is earning her third online masterâ€™s degree and barely leaves her room, except for those mysterious Tuesday-night outings she wonâ€™t discuss. And Mrs. Bennet has one thing on her mind: how to marry off her daughters, especially as Janeâ€™s fortieth birthday fast approaches.\r\n\r\nEnter Chip Bingley, a handsome new-in-town doctor who recently appeared on the juggernaut reality TV dating show Eligible. At a Fourth of July barbecue, Chip takes an immediate interest in Jane, but Chipâ€™s friend neurosurgeon Fitzwilliam Darcy reveals himself to Liz to be much less charming. . . . \r\n\r\nAnd yet, first impressions can be deceiving.\r\n\r\nPraise for Eligible\r\n\r\nâ€œEven the most ardent Austenite will soon find herself seduced.â€â€”O: The Oprah Magazine\r\n\r\nâ€œBlissful . . . Sittenfeld modernizes the classic in such a stylish, witty way youâ€™d guess even Jane Austen would be pleased.â€â€”People (book of the week)\r\n\r\nâ€œ[A] sparkling, fresh contemporary retelling.â€â€”Entertainment Weekly\r\n\r\nâ€œ[Sittenfeld] is the ideal modern-day reinterpreter. Her special skill lies not just in her clear, clean writing, but in her general amusement about the world, her arch, pithy, dropped-mike observations about behavior, character and motivation. She can spot hypocrisy, cant, self-contradiction and absurdity ten miles away. Sheâ€™s the one you want to leave the party with, so she can explain what really happened. . . . Not since Clueless, which transported Emma to Beverly Hills, has Austen been so delightedly interpreted. . . . Sittenfeld writes so wellâ€”her sentences are so good and her story so satisfying. . . . As a reader, let me just say: Three cheers for Curtis Sittenfeld and her astute, sharp and ebullient anthropological interest in the human condition.â€â€”Sarah Lyall, The New York Times Book Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69bd1e40bc2e6ade9deaff8dc8cb9a35572f8d02","amp;dn":"Eligible+%28Curtis+Sittenfeld%29+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69bd1e40bc2e6ade9deaff8dc8cb9a35572f8d02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,189,30,64,188,46,106,222,157,234,255,141,200,203,154,53,87,47,141,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
