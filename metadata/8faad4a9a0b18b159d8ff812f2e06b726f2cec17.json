As such, topics specific to the construction industry are presented, as well as essential areas for Level 2 craft NVQs for example, costing calculations, labor costs, cost of materials and setting out of building components.\nEnd of chapter exercises cover a range of theoretical as well as practical problems commonly found in construction practice, and two project-based assignments give students the opportunity to apply the knowledge they have gained. Answers to all exercises are included at the end of book. A chapter detailing the use of a scientific calculator for performing construction calculations will prove invaluable for students with no prior experience of their use.\nConstruction Mathematics addresses all the mathematical requirements of Level 2 construction NVQs from City &amp; Guilds/CITB and Edexcel courses, including the BTEC First Diploma in Construction. Additional coverage of the core unit Analytical Methods from BTEC National Construction, Civil Engineering, and Building Services courses makes this an essential revision aid to students who do not have Level 2 mathematics experience before commencing their BTEC National studies, or any reader who wishes to refresh their mathematics knowledge.\nSolutions to the assignments are available to lecturers only at http://textbooks.elsevier.com\n* Focuses on construction topics not found in traditional technician-level mathematics textbooks - essential for students learning how to apply mathematics in building and construction\n* Content matched to the learning outcomes of CITB / City &amp; Guilds and Edexcel construction courses at Levels 2 and 3, including the core unit Analytical Methods for BTEC National, and the new VGCSE in Construction and the Built Environment\n* Technically accurate construction images provide graphical representation of key construction scenarios in which mathematics topics are introduced\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8faad4a9a0b18b159d8ff812f2e06b726f2cec17","amp;dn":"Construction+Mathematics+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8faad4a9a0b18b159d8ff812f2e06b726f2cec17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,170,212,169,160,177,139,21,157,143,248,18,242,224,107,114,111,44,236,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
