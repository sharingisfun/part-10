The trio first met in London, where they began performing live. America achieved significant popularity in the 1970s, and was famous for the trio's close vocal harmonies and light acoustic folk sound. This popularity was confirmed by a string of hit albums and singles, many of which found airplay on pop stations.\n\nThe band came together shortly after the members' graduation from high school, and a record deal with Warner Bros. Records followed. Their debut, a 1971 self-titled album, produced the transatlantic hits &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot; and &quot;I Need You&quot;. Homecoming (1972) produced the single &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, and preceded Hat Trick (1973), which fared poorly on the charts. 1974's Holiday featured the hits &quot;Tin Man&quot; and &quot;Lonely People&quot;, and 1975's Hearts generated the number one single &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot;, alongside &quot;Daisy Jane&quot;. History: America's Greatest Hits, a compilation of singles, was released the same year and was certified multi-platinum in the United States and Australia. Peek left the group in 1977 and their commercial fortunes declined, despite a brief return to the top in 1982 with the single &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot;.\n\nFour decades into their career, the group continues to record material and tour with regularity. Their 2007 album Here &amp; Now was a collaboration with a new generation of musicians who credited the band as an influence. America has been inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHomecoming is a 1972 album by America. Acoustic guitar-based, with a more pronounced electric guitar and keyboard section than their first album, their second effort helped continue the band's success, and includes one of their best known hits, &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;.\n\nHomecoming peaked at #9 on Billboard's Pop Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA. It produced three hit singles: &quot;Ventura Highway&quot; which peaked at #8 on the Billboard singles chart and #3 on the adult contemporary chart; &quot;Don't Cross the River&quot; which hit #35 on Billboard and #23 on the AC chart; and &quot;Only in Your Heart&quot; peaked at #62 on Billboard's Pop singles chart. Several other songs received radio airplay on FM stations playing album tracks, including &quot;To Each His Own&quot;, &quot;California Revisited&quot;, and &quot;Cornwall Blank&quot;.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\nDan Peek: guitar, piano, vocals\n\nGerry Beckley: guitar, piano, vocals, bass guitar on &quot;Till the Sun Comes Up Again&quot; and &quot;Head &amp; Heart&quot;\n\nDewey Bunnell: guitar, piano, vocals, percussion on &quot;Head &amp; Heart&quot;\n\nJoe Osborn: bass guitar\n\nHal Blaine: drums, percussion\n\nGary Mallaber: drums and percussion on &quot;Till the Sun Comes Up Again&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9f6f5bf8b2ffc442a022b525dfb44b81a19b06","amp;dn":"America+-+Homecoming+%5B1972%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BSACD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b9f6f5bf8b2ffc442a022b525dfb44b81a19b06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,159,111,91,248,178,255,196,66,160,34,181,37,223,180,75,129,161,155,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
