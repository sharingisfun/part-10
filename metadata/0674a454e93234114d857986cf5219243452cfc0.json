Chamish&amp;#039;s other books primarily expose Israel&amp;#039;s inner politcal corruption and warned that it was threatening the viability of the nation. In Israel Betrayed readers will learn why Yitzhak Rabin was murdered, how Baruch Goldstein was framed for a massacre he did not commit, how murder was used to keep &quot;peace&quot; on track, who is behind Israel&amp;#039;s suicide, and why the israeli people don&amp;#039;t suspect the truth. Israel Betrayed is vital reading for anyone who loves Israel and wishes to save the country from its real enemies without, and from the traitors within. 95 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0674a454e93234114d857986cf5219243452cfc0","amp;dn":"Chamish+-+Israel+Betrayed+%28New+World+Order+against+Israel%29+%282000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0674a454e93234114d857986cf5219243452cfc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,116,164,84,233,50,52,17,77,133,121,134,207,82,25,36,52,82,207,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
