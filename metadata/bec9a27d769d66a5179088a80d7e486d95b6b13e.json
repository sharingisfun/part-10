Episode numbers will not match IMDB as the 2 part episodes are\ncombined in one file, saw no reason to change them.\n\nThe extras are included - best way to check quality\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103405/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103405/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStoryline\n\nThe fifth daughter of a wealthy Boston physician, Michaela Quinn defies the conventions of post-Civil War society by following in her father's footsteps. After his death, 'Dr. Mike' leaves Boston and moves to the frontier town of Colorado Springs, where she finds the citizens less than thrilled by the concept of a woman doctor. While she struggles to earn their trust, Mike's life is complicated by a growing relationship with mountain man Byron Sully, and the unexpected responsibility of raising three orphaned children.\n\nReview\n\nDespite being such a simple series, It is probably one of the best for that reason. The 'EastEnders' of nowadays is becoming way too stereotypical and predictable that this masterpiece of a series has a somewhat timelessness to it. I mean, I'm a 16 year old, and I'M ADDICTED TO IT! The acting is of a high standard and there is no part of it I can deem as typical.\n\nThe best thing is, that if you miss a few episodes and pick it up from a random episode, it still makes sense and you still enjoy watching it. It's not like one of those series that if you miss one episode, you don't really understand what's going on in all the episodes following it. That is why this series is so viewer-friendly.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec9a27d769d66a5179088a80d7e486d95b6b13e","amp;dn":"Dr.+Quinn+Medicine+Woman+Season+02+Ep+01+-+12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec9a27d769d66a5179088a80d7e486d95b6b13e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,201,162,125,118,157,102,165,23,144,136,168,13,126,72,109,149,182,177,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
