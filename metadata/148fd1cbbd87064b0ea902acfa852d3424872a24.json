There is no cure. In a few days 90 percent of its victims are dead. A secret military SWAT team of soldiers and scientists is mobilized to stop the outbreak of this exotic &quot;hot&quot; virus. The Hot Zone tells this dramatic story, giving a hair-raising account of the\nappearance of rare and lethal viruses and their &quot;crashes&quot; into the human race. Shocking, frightening, and impossible to ignore, The Hot Zone proves that truth really is scarier than fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148fd1cbbd87064b0ea902acfa852d3424872a24","amp;dn":"The+Hot+Zone+-+Richard+Preston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148fd1cbbd87064b0ea902acfa852d3424872a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,143,209,203,189,135,6,75,14,169,2,172,250,133,45,52,36,135,42,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
