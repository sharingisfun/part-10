Beginning with a last-minute request from ex-governor Jesse Ventura, the narrative winds between the author's own story of covering &quot;deep politics&quot; and the facts he has uncovered. The ongoing campaign against Victor Bout, the &quot;Merchant of Death,&quot; is revealed as &quot;move/countermove&quot; in a game of geopolitics, set against the background of a crumbling Soviet Union, a nascent Russia, bizarre assassinations, wars and smuggling.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Daniel Estulin is an award-winning investigative journalist and the author of The True Story of the Bilderberg Group","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db55835e17cb1fb83d7b81e596264921d7e4a39b","amp;dn":"Shadow+Masters+-+Daniel+Estulin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db55835e17cb1fb83d7b81e596264921d7e4a39b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,85,131,94,23,203,31,184,61,123,129,229,150,38,73,33,215,228,163,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
