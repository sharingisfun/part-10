The film is an adaptation of the book A Seal Called Andre, which in turn was based on a true story.\n\nToni Whitney, a nine-year-old girl, and her Rockport, Maine family adopt an orphaned baby seal, naming it Andre. Andre is manageable when he is young but as Andre gets older and starts getting into mischief, he antagonizes some of the local fishermen. Toni forms an inseparable bond with Andre, but their relationship becomes threatened when the fishermen do not want to deal with Andre's antics any longer. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109120/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109120/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff016ac51f69bbd4775994f188bf0db023c6a66","amp;dn":"Andre+%281994%29+DVD+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff016ac51f69bbd4775994f188bf0db023c6a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,240,22,172,81,246,155,189,71,117,153,79,24,139,240,219,2,60,106,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
