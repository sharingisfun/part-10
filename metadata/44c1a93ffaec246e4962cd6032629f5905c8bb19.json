It's a craft that requires extensive knowledge of the marketsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½involving a whole lot more than just finding the next great trading opportunityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a process that addresses many aspects of both the market's, and your own, behavior.\n\nNobody understands this better than author and longtime trader Peter Brandt. During his thirty-plus years in this field, he has made every mistake possible and learned some major lessons along the way. He also developed a set of guidelines, rules, and practicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which he refers to as the Factor Trading PlanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that direct his trading decisions.\n\nNow, in Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader, Brandt shares the experiences he has gained trading price charts over the years, and through a real-time journalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which spans an arbitrary time frame of 21 weeks (from December 2009 to April 2010)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½skillfully shows how he goes about the difficult endeavor of trading the commodity and forex markets using classical charting principles.\n\nDivided into four comprehensive parts, this personal and unique guide clearly reveals the uncertainty and emotions that surround trading and details an effective approach towards speculation that will give you an edge.
