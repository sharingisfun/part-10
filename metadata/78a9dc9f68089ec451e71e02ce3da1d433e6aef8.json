Plant dealer Laroche was determined to find and clone the rare Ghost Orchid for profit. Along the way, Orlean met people in the plant business. In their and Laroche's struggles and oddities, she glimpsed true passion for the first time in her life.\n\nThe book was later adapted by Charlie Kaufman for Spike Jonze's film Adaptation (2002), with Nicolas Cage as Charlie and Donald Kaufman, Tilda Swinton as Valerie Thomas, Meryl Streep as Orlean and Chris Cooper as Laroche. The film is a satire on the process of adaptation, in which Orlean's book is turned into a formulaic Hollywood thriller.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction/General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78a9dc9f68089ec451e71e02ce3da1d433e6aef8","amp;dn":"The+Orchid+Thief+by+Susan+Orlean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78a9dc9f68089ec451e71e02ce3da1d433e6aef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,169,220,159,104,8,158,196,81,231,30,2,206,61,161,212,51,230,174,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
