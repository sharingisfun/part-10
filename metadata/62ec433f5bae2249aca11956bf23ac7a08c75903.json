The band\nmade their name through some stunning love shows, mixing math-rock\nrhythms, guitar pyrotechnics and screeching electronics.\n\nA stunning live act, the London based band have already released\nseveral EPs. Once vowing never to name their songs - preferring instead\nto number them - Three Trapped Tigers dropped this schtick a long time\nago.\n\nFocussing on actual songs, Three Trapped Tigers have broadened their\nsound. Due to be released on Blood &amp; Biscuits this May, debut album\n'Route One Or Die' contains a blistering eight tracks.\n\nSwapping numbers of genuine names, the band have confirmed tracks such\nas 'Creepies', 'Noise Trade' and 'Cramm'. Ending with 'Reset' the album\nis the group's most ambitious statement yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ec433f5bae2249aca11956bf23ac7a08c75903","amp;dn":"Three+Trapped+Tigers+-+Route+One+Or+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ec433f5bae2249aca11956bf23ac7a08c75903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,236,67,63,91,174,34,73,172,161,25,86,191,35,172,122,8,199,89,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
