Despite being relatively young, he has been able to establish himself among the top in the musical universe. He learnt the sarod from his father Hafiz Ali Khan. \n\nHe was born in 1945. He comes from a family of musicians. His great-grand father, Gulam Ali Khan, was a court musician at Gwalior and is credited with modifying the difficult rabab into the sarod. His grandfather Nannhe Khan was also a court musician in Gwalior. Amjad Ali Khan studied under his father Hafiz Ali Khan. By the age of ten he was holding public performances and matured into a recognized talent by 15. Amjad Ali Khan has contributed immensely towards making the sarod popular as a solo instrument in the western world. He made many changes to the conventional style and structure of the sarod. The sarod, as designed and constructed earlier, could not convey the subtle shades of classical music. It tended to distort the tonal facets emphasising more on staccato than legato features. Nor could it produce the fast tans and gamakas. He researched these problems and made changes in the design of the instrument and gauze of the strings used. He also introduced the gayaki in the sarod, which has added new dimensions to performances on this instrument. He plays with his nails to produce precise, clear and microtonal sounds and with the fleshy part of his fingers which produces a flat sound known as rui dhunna, which refers to the sound made when fluffing and cleaning cotton wool by hand. \n\n\n[Note: Some of the albums have already been uploaded earlier by my dear friend Ryabov or by me (on Demonoid).
