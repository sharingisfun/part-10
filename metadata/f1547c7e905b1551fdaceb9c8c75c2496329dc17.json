Great efforts have been put into preserving as much of the original signal as possible during the noise reduction process. As a result, DeNoise can reduce or in many cases completely remove the noise in a very transparent manner without loss of transients, attacks or Ã¢â‚¬Å“airÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the recording.\n\n\n   DeHum targets hum and buzz typically introduced by poorly grounded electrical equipment, but also other tonal noise sources like electrical motor noise.\n\n\n   DeClick is designed to remove impulsive noise such as clicks and crackle. These distortions are frequently encountered on LP and 78 RPM records, but also occur in digital recordings due to drop-outs or distorted data packets.\n\n\n   DeClip restores audio recordings distorted by analog or digital clipping.\n\n\nPlatforms and Plug-in Formats\n\n   Available as VST or AAX plug-ins on PC (Windows)\n   Native 32 bit or 64 bit versions of all plug-ins are available\n   Support sampling rates up to 96 kHz\n\n\n\nPC Version (Windows)\n\n   A Pentium IV or higher\n   Minimum 256 MB RAM (1 GB recommended)\n   Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista or Windows XP\n   A host application that is compatible with VST or AAX (32 bit or 64 bit)\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n\n              1.
