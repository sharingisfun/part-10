The colorful, metropolis-inhabiting characters like Billericay Dickie or Plaistow Patricia he sung about, and the ever so cockney music hall accent he chose to sing in, were a big part of that. But mostly, it was the detailed, poetic way he cataloged English life and the melting pot of musical styles he used to do so, from punk and funk to jazz and rock'n'roll, which left no doubt that Dury's work could only come from one place: the very heart of England. So few were surprised when after his death Sir Paul McCartney, Robbie Williams, Madness and more all lined up to pay their respects with cover versions of some of his best loved songs. You'll find plenty of them here, in their original versions, culled from his entire career from the mid-'70s with pub rockers Kilburn &amp; The High Roads through the golden years with the majestic Blockheads right up to the last studio recordings at the start of the '90s. 2 CD set is comprised of 34 tracks. \n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Wake Up And Make Love With Me\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[02] Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[03] Sweet Gene Vincent\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[04] My Old Man\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[05] Razzle In My Pocket\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[06] What A Waste\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[07] Rough Kids\t---&gt; Kilburn &amp; The High Roads\n[08] The Roadette Song\t---&gt; Kilburn &amp; The High Roads\n[09] Pam's Moods\t---&gt; Kilburn &amp; The High Roads\n[10] Reasons To Be Cheerful, Part 3\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[11] Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[12] There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[13] Inbetweenies\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[14] Don't Ask Me\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[15] I Want To Be Straight\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[16] Superman's Big Sister\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[17] Yes &amp; No (Paula)\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[18] That's Not All\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[19] Fucking Ada\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[20] The Bus Driver's Prayer\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n\n\tDisc 01 Play Time 01h:11m:43s\n\nDosc 02\n\n[01] Jack Shit George\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[02] Bed O' Roses No. 9\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[03] Dance Little Rude Boy\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[04] Mash It Up Harry\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[05] It Ain't Cool\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[06] Books And Water\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[07] Really Glad You Came\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Music Students\n[08] Peter The Painter\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Music Students\n[09] Profoundly In Love With Pandora\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[10] Poor Joey\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[11] Poo-Poo In The Prawn\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[12] Clever Trevor\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[13] If I Was With A Woman\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[14] Billericay Dickie\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[15] Spasticus Autisticus\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n[16] Blockheads\t---&gt; Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n\n\tDisc 02 Play Time 01h:18m:35s\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 02h:30m:18s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 354mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Alternative Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 03 October 2005\nRecord Company\t&gt; Demon Music Group\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.iandury.co.uk\n\t&gt; http://www.theblockheads.com\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Dury\n\t&gt; http://www.iandury.com/Albums \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c4b2f8e044e1c01b90bdc92b22461629d01bbb8","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Reasons+To+Be+Cheerful+%28The+Best+Of%29+-+Ian+Dury+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c4b2f8e044e1c01b90bdc92b22461629d01bbb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,75,47,142,4,78,28,1,185,11,220,146,178,36,97,98,157,1,187,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
