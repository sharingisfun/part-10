McMurtry&amp;#039;s ninth\nalbum, which features 12 new songs, is a follow-up to 2005&amp;#039;s critically\nacclaimed and award-winning project, Childish Things. \n\nMcMurtry has long been known as fine storyteller, but he has lately received\nnationwide attention for his role as a musical activist. On Just Us Kids,\nMcMurtry picks up where he left off with his controversial anthem ?We Can&amp;#039;t Make\nIt Here.&quot; On ?Cheney&amp;#039;s Toy,&quot; McMurtry once again reminds us that the war in Iraq\nis still going on, with veiled references to Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and the\nstark image of a soldier who returned from the conflict, blind and brain\ndamaged. The lyrics of ?God Bless America&quot; call out the corporate profiteering\nand cronyism of the heads of state who led the country to war. McMurtry&amp;#039;s songs\nintroduce the listener to characters that exist on the fringes of society. Drug\naddicts, murderers, crooked politicians, and other unsavory folks all play a\npart on Just Us Kids. \n\nThe self-produced album shows that McMurtry has developed a skill as producer\nthat matches his songcraft. The songs on Just Us Kids vary widely in texture and\ninstrumentation. The Faces&amp;#039; Ian McLagan&amp;#039;s piano playing is all over the album\nwhile Timbuk3&amp;#039;s pat mAcdonald&amp;#039;s harmonica peppers several tracks. Austin\nsinger/songwriter John Dee Graham contributes a wailing guitar solo to ?Fireline\nRoad.&quot; Grammy-nominated Louisiana rocker, C.C. Adcock, adds a swampy guitar part\nto the album opener, ?Bayou Tortous.&quot; The rhythm section is McMurtry&amp;#039;s longtime\nroad band, Daren Hess and Ronnie Johnson. \n\nJust Us Kids will be the first release for Nashville-based Lightning Rod\nRecords, distributed by Thirty Tigers/RED. Label president Logan Rogers\npreviously worked as director of A&amp;R for Compadre Records on the release of\nMcMurtry&amp;#039;s last two albums. ?Working with James McMurtry has been a career\nhighlight for me. He is a phenomenal artist with tremendous integrity, and I can\nthink of no better debut release for Lightning Rod Records,&quot; said Rogers. \n\nAuthor Stephen King described Ft. Worth native McMurtry as ?the truest, fiercest\nsongwriter of his generation&quot; in Entertainment Weekly. The son of acclaimed\nauthor Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment), James grew up on a\nsteady diet of Johnny Cash and Roy Acuff records. His first album, released in\n1989, was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of\nacclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill. In 2003, McMurtry released the\nuniversally lauded Live in Aught-Three (Compadre Records). 2005&amp;#039;s Childish\nThings garnered some of the highest critical praise of McMurtry&amp;#039;s career and\nspent six weeks at number one on R&amp;R&amp;#039;s Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and\n2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and ?We Can&amp;#039;t Make It Here&quot; won the\nAmericana Music Awards for album and song of the year, respectively. \n\nIn 2007, McMurtry performed on PBS&amp;#039; long running music program, ?Austin City\nLimits,&quot; for the second time in his career. This year, McMurtry and his band\nwill launch a national tour in support of &amp;#039;Just Us Kids.&amp;#039;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:155b77c6283bc973c2f534c73da5939e11442c7e","amp;dn":"James+McMurtry-Just+Us+Kids+%282008-VBR-Country%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"155b77c6283bc973c2f534c73da5939e11442c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,91,119,198,40,59,201,115,194,245,52,199,61,165,147,158,17,68,44,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
