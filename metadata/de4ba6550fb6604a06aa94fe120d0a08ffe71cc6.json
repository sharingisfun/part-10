Fortunately, besides the old boring math problem worksheets given out in most traditional classrooms, there is an almost endless variety of ways that mathematics can be presented to unenthusiastic learners that will arouse their interest and make them want to dig deeper thus stretching and improving their minds.\n\nOptical Illusions Brain Teasers for Everyone, created by our expert Mind Hurdles math professionals, is just such a book. You might ask how can a book filled with optical illusions help my child improve in math? The simple answer is that anyone, regardless of their age, is forced to begin to solve the illusion the moment their eyes see it. Optical illusions demand that the mind think.
