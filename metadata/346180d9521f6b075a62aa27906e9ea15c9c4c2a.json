Hardy throws himself into the subject in a serious but unpretentious way. Travelling to Botswana, Tanzania and South Africa, he meets rangers, farmers, conservationists and journalists to ask simple questions just as you or I would. He also swears a bit, which we all might do when invited to feed oranges to a massive wild elephant or pat its huge belly. The facts and horrendous pictures of slaughtered rhinos and elephants speak for themselves, though. More than 600 rhinos were shot by poachers in 2012 because their horns are more valuable than gold. &quot;It's a helluva price to have on your head,&quot; sighs Hardy who also talks to locals who have understandably been tempted to turn poacher because of financial rewards. Watch out for the most extraordinary scene when Hardy becomes the quarry for a herd of elephants trained to track poachers.\n\n\n1)  1 \nBafta award-winning actor Tom Hardy (Inception, The Dark Knight Rises) travels to Africa to uncover the truth about why the poaching of elephants and rhinos has reached crisis point. He begins his journey in South Africa, where he meets people who are trying to save rhinos using a variety of different techniques, including the implementation of anti-poaching organisations and the more controversial approach of dehorning. These individuals provide an insight into the illicit trade.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nTom Hardy continues his journey through Africa to uncover the truth about elephant and rhino poaching. Meeting Tshekedi Khama, the Botswanan Minister for the Environment, Wildlife and Tourism, Tom finds out how harmful the authorities consider the illicit ivory trade. He then joins members of a crack team from the Botswana Defence Force as they scour the country's northern borders for illegal poaching activities, and, in Mozambique, he encounters a civil war veteran who explains how two decades' work nurturing elephants has been undone in recent years. The actor completes his journey at a rhino sanctuary in Tanzania, where a baby elephant turns up to bid him a surprise farewell.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6311/ud25.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6311/ud25.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/2929/xki7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/2929/xki7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/9880/ht4k.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/9880/ht4k.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/6444/rsbc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/6444/rsbc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/4594/pa0f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/4594/pa0f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/985/pdy6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/985/pdy6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/7284/2i4h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/7284/2i4h.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6057/wdnc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6057/wdnc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/6303/dpl7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/6303/dpl7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d890b1bfb09894ebf6e8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1970 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 46mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 2\n * Part Size: 642 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10259735/Poaching-Wars-with-Tom-Hardy-ITV-review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10259735/Poaching-Wars-with-Tom-Hardy-ITV-review.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:346180d9521f6b075a62aa27906e9ea15c9c4c2a","amp;dn":"ITV+Poaching+Wars+with+Tom+Hardy+1of2+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"346180d9521f6b075a62aa27906e9ea15c9c4c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,97,128,217,82,31,107,7,90,98,170,39,144,110,158,161,92,156,76,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
