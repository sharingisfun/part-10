The only constant factor was guitarist Neal Schon (born February 27, 1954), a music prodigy who had been a member of Santana in 1971-1972. The original unit, which was named in a contest on KSAN-FM in San Francisco, featured Schon, bassist Ross Valory, drummer Prairie Prince (replaced by Aynsley Dunbar), and guitarist George Tickner (who left after the first album). Another former Santana member, keyboard player and singer Gregg Rolie, joined shortly afterward. This lineup recorded Journey (1975), the first of three moderate-selling jazz-rock albums given over largely to instrumentals.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Only The Young\n02.Don't Stop Believin'\n03.Wheel In The Sky\n04.Faithfully\n05.Any Way You Want It\n06.Ask The Lonely\n07.Who's Crying Now\n08.Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\n09.Lights\n10.Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\n11.Open Arms\n12.Girl Can't Help It\n13.Send Her My Love\n14.When You Love A Woman\n15.I'll Be Alright Without You\n16.After The Fall\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Chain Reaction\n02.Message Of Love\n03.Somethin' To Hide\n04.Line Of Fire\n05.Anytime\n06.Stone In Love\n07.Patiently\n08.Good Morning Girl\n09.The Eyes Of A Woman\n10.Be Good To Yourself\n11.Still They Ride\n12.Baby I'm A Leavin' You\n13.Mother, Father\n14.Just The Same Way\n15.Escape\n16.The Party's Over (Hopelessly In Love)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9e7fb2fd4f3fb7434d2e0cb4a163f142c41c5a8","amp;dn":"Journey+-+The+Essential+Journey+2CD+%282001%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9e7fb2fd4f3fb7434d2e0cb4a163f142c41c5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,231,251,47,212,243,251,116,52,210,224,203,74,22,63,20,44,65,197,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
