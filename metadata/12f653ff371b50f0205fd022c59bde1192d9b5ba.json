Their members include Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) and his two older brothers, Soda (Rob Lowe) and Darry (Patrick Swayze), as well as Johnny Cade (Ralph Macchio), Dally Winston (Matt Dillon), Two-Bit Matthews (Emilio Estevez), and Steve Randle (Tom Cruise). Their fateful rivalry is with the Socs (pronounced &quot;soashes,&quot; short for the word 'Social'), a gang of preppier, wealthier kids. There is a series of confrontations. Five of the Socs jump Ponyboy and cut his neck with a switchblade; Johnny had been attacked similarly a month earlier. Bob Sheldon (Leif Garrett) and Randy Adderson (Darren Dalton), two of the Socs, confront Johnny, Ponyboy, and Two-Bit, who have befriended their girlfriends, Cherry (Diane Lane) and Marcia (Michelle Meyrink), at a drive-in. The girls defuse the situation by going home with the Soc boys. Ponyboy and Johnny are attacked later in a park by Bob, Randy and two other Socs. They begin dunking Ponyboy in a fountain, but Johnny comes to his rescue by pulling out his own switchblade and stabbing Bob, killing him.\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: The Outsiders 1983 720p BRRip\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile size: 2425.63 MiB\nDuration: 1h 54mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 950 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-11-24 09:06:42\nSubtitles: English\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: avc1\nAverage video bitrate: 2 500 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: 1080p Blu-ray Thanks\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, Noir, Blackjesus, PhoenixRG, SiNiSTER, BTVRG, Twentyforty and all other Releasers we respect....
