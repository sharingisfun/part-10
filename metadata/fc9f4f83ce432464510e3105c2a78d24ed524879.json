That could be because it's the first album that they recorded in their own state-of-the-art Atlas Studio in Paris. They also supply all of the vocal parts, and included longtime collaborator Joey Waronker on drum duty. Judging by the first single, &quot;Do the Joy,&quot; Love 2 is based on the same meticulous arrangements and air-light (sorry) synths that the duo is known for.\n~ Matthew Blackwell\n\n----\n\nJust when we were beginning to forget that French musicians don't traffic exclusively in EQed-to-death monster-house jams, Phoenix came along with the weightless Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and reminded us that, oh yeah, the French can also be pretty great at luminously suave pop music. Now that our appetite for smoove, starry-eyed Gallic studio-rat music has been restored, it's the perfect time for Air to drop a new album. And that's exactly what they're doing.\nOn October 6, Astralwerks will release Love 2, the fifth studio album from the Paris duo. This will be the first album that Air recorded at their own Atlas Studio, which I have to imagine is the most luxurious recording studio on the planet. Jean-Benoit Dunckel and Nicolas Godin handle all the album's vocals by themselves, and L.A. gun-for-hire drummer Joey Waronker sits in on the entire record.\n\nAnd yes, to answer your question, the album does include a song called &quot;African Velvet&quot;. There's also one called &quot;So Light Is Her Footfall&quot;. This might be a pretty good time to invest in a new lava lamp.\n\n&quot;Do the Joy&quot; will be available as a &quot;viral single&quot; on July 7, according to a press release. On August 25, they'll drop the album's first proper single, &quot;Sing Sang Sung&quot;.\n\nAir - Love 2\n\n01 Do the Joy\n02 Love\n03 So Light Is Her Footfall\n04 Be a Bee\n05 Missing the Light of the Day\n06 Tropical Disease\n07 Heaven's Light\n08 Night Hunter\n09 Sing Sang Sung\n10 Eat My Beat\n11 You Can Tell It to Everybody\n12 African Velvet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9f4f83ce432464510e3105c2a78d24ed524879","amp;dn":"Air+-+Love+2+%282009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9f4f83ce432464510e3105c2a78d24ed524879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,159,79,131,206,67,36,100,81,14,49,5,194,167,141,36,237,82,72,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
