The album's\nabrasive and aggressive sound was a departure from the polished production\nof the band's breakthrough second album, Nevermind (1991), due in part to\nthe selection of recording engineer Steve Albini. The subject matters of the\nsongs included dysfunctional family, cancer, issues of privacy, and abortion.\n&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was the first single released from the album, followed by\n&quot;All Apologies/Rape Me&quot;, which was released as a double A-side single due to\nthe explicit nature of the latter song. Both singles topped the Billboard Modern\nRock Tracks chart in the United States. &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; was intended to be\nreleased as the third single in April 1994, but was cancelled after the death of\nthe band's frontman, Kurt Cobain.\n\nWhile In Utero did not sell as well as Nevermind, it was a commercial and\ncritical success. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry\nAssociation of America by the end of 1993; it was most recently certified 5x\nplatinum, and now ranks in the top 100 bestselling albums in the US.\n\n\n1.
