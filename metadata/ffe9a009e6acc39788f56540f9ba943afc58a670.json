Cheers!\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nMÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e were one of the most influential hair metal bands of the '80s, boasting a striking visual presence and hedonistic reputation rivaled only by Guns N' Roses. By combining Alice Cooper's shock rock with the bluesy, metallic stomp of the New York Dolls and Aerosmith, they helped establish hair metal as a commercial genre, sending their first five albums to platinum status in the process. Such success was at least partially due to MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e's reputation as a riotous pack of rabble-rousers, replete with drug addictions, near-death experiences, groupie encounters, and celebrity girlfriends. Of course, that same self-indulgence nearly derailed the band, forcing the musicians to embrace sobriety during the creation of their most successful album to date, 1989's Dr. Feelgood. Like most hair metal bands, MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e's album sales waned during the 1990s, as the popularity of grunge overshadowed most of the music that immediately prefaced it. Nevertheless, the band soldiered through the decade with modest success, releasing two gold-selling albums along the way. The new millennium brought similar luck, as MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e established themselves as a fashionable touring act (with CrÃƒÂ¼e Fest becoming the summer's highest-grossing festival in 2008) while continuing to release new material. \n\n\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2003\nQuality..............: mp3 (CBR 320) Insane\n\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Wild Side\n02.Too Fast For Love\n03.Shout At The Devil\n04.A Rat Like Me\n05.Primal Scream\n06.Let Us Prey\n07.Dancing On Glass\n08.Bitter Pill\n09.Dr. Feelgood\n10.You're All I Need\n11.Piece Of Your Action\n12.Red Hot\n13.Find Myself\n14.Hell On High Heels\n15.Tonight (We Need A Lover)\n16.Poison Apples\n17.Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\n18.Starry Eyes\n19.Danger\n\nCD2\n\n01.Kickstart My Heart\n02.Looks That Kill\n03.Louder Than Hell\n04.Take Me To The Top\n05.Girls, Girls, Girls\n06.Afraid\n07.Hooligan's Holiday\n08.Knock 'Em Dead, Kid\n09.Slice Of Your Pie\n10.Merry-Go-Round\n11.All In The Name Of...\n12.Too Young To Fall In Love\n13.Glitter\n14.Smokin' In The Boys Room\n15.Punched In The Teeth By Love\n16.Beauty\n17.Live Wire\n18.Same Ol' Situation (S.O.S.)\n19.Home Sweet Home\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe9a009e6acc39788f56540f9ba943afc58a670","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+Loud+As+Fuck+%282003%29+%7B320%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe9a009e6acc39788f56540f9ba943afc58a670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,233,160,9,230,172,195,151,136,245,101,64,249,186,148,58,252,88,166,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
