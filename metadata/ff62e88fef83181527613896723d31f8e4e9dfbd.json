Material presets (.mc6) do nothing in D|S, and most use multiple image layers or internal colour manipulation that do mot load up (use LIE to make you own combinations using the provided texture maps, and play with the diffuse channel to change colours quickly). Lights load with no shadow settings, the water needs a serious makeover (shaders are great), but otherwise a nice little scene to race around, like those electric car sets that never really stayed on the track.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nHere is a test render I made in D|S with a few of those surfaces corrected:\r\nLayered image on the road, diffuse to red on some trees, a shader for the water surface.\r\n \nhttps://pximg.xyz/images/3eabb1ecdb3cb2f468154070cf17b8fd.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff62e88fef83181527613896723d31f8e4e9dfbd","amp;dn":"Poser+%7E+DAZ3D+%3A+Road+and+Track+Scenery+%5BRO+100032%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff62e88fef83181527613896723d31f8e4e9dfbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,98,232,143,239,131,24,21,39,97,56,150,114,61,49,248,228,233,223,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
