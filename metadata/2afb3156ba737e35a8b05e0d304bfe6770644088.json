When U.S. troops entered Afghanistan in the weeks following September 11, 2001, they overthrew the Afghan Taliban regime and sent the terrorists it harbored on the run. But AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s initial easy victory is in sharp contrast to the difficulties it faces today in confronting the Taliban resurgence.\nOriginally published in 2002, Stephen TannerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Afghanistan has now been completely updated to include the crucial turn of events since America first entered the country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2afb3156ba737e35a8b05e0d304bfe6770644088","amp;dn":"Afghanistan+by+Steven+Tanner+-+Traitor.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2afb3156ba737e35a8b05e0d304bfe6770644088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,251,49,86,186,115,126,53,168,176,94,13,48,75,254,103,112,100,64,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
