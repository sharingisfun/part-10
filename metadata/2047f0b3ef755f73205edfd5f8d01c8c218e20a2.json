The pianistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trio featured Jimmy Cobb on drums, and two different bassists, Ron Carter and Larry Ridley, replacing the regular member Paul Chambers, who for some reason couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t attend the shows. These performances took place a few months before the well-known recordings made by Montgomery and Kelly for Verve at the same venue, issued as SmokinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at the Half Note.\n\nAmong the many highlights, these programs contain an amazing unaccompanied guitar version of WesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Mi Cosa, his only live readings of All the Things You Are, and his own composition Cariba, as well as the guitaristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only existing versions of BirksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Works, Laura and I Remember You!
