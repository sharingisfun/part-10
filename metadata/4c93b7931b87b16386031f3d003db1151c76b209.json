This audiobook distills the best of these workshops and combines a spiritual perspective of money with sound practical advice. \n\nTHE ENERGY OF MONEY is not an investment or budgeting course, nor is it a treatise on prosperity consciousness. Rather, it is an intensely introspective course that requires listeners to examine their beliefs, habits and deeply ingrained behavior patterns surrounding money. \n\nUsing powerful techniques and exercises, Nemeth addresses such topics as: the three symptoms of driven behavior, binging and purging with money, scarcity, unfinished money business, plugging money leaks, &quot;busyholism,&quot; and creating and meeting realistic financial goals. A helpful study guide accompanies the set. \n\nTHE ENERGY OF MONEY is a rewarding work, impeccably presented and recorded, and worth repeated listening. C.S. Winner of AUDIOFILE Earphones Award.
