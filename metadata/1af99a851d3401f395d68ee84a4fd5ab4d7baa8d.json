Their oldest son, Elvis, just lost his best friend in an accident and is going through a bit of an identity crisis. Their daughter, Sue, is what you would call extraordinarily ordinary. However, this is not the case with their seven-year-old, Brick, who is different from other kids his age. Brick's best friend is his backpack. Executive producers Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline bring you The Middle and its take on life in the part of the country we don't often see. It may not be glamorous or showy, but it's a place where family comes first, and you do whatever it takes to keep your family together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1af99a851d3401f395d68ee84a4fd5ab4d7baa8d","amp;dn":"The.Middle.S04E20.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1af99a851d3401f395d68ee84a4fd5ab4d7baa8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,249,154,133,29,52,1,243,149,214,142,232,74,79,213,171,77,123,170,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
