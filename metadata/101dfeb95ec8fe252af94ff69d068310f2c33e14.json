Will the success enjoyed by 50 Cent, Eminem and The Game work for Busta? Surprisingly, Busta has never sounded so mature -- joining a brigade of over 30 rappers who are thinking beyond the corner. Songs like \\&quot;In the Ghetto,\\&quot; \\&quot;Been Through the Storm\\&quot; and \\&quot;You CanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t Hold a Torch\\&quot; reflect a more grown-man outlook, which is a refreshing departure. There are the requisite fast-chatter club tracks, some predictably formulaic (\\&quot;Touch It\\&quot;), some better than expected (\\&quot;I Love My Bitch\\&quot;), some that will leave you scratching your head (\\&quot;IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll Do It All,\\&quot; featuring Latoya Jackson). Unfortunately, the album is also overloaded with more guests than needed --Stevie Wonder and Q-Tip were good, while Rick James middling and Swizz Beatz should stick to producing. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s hard to tell what expectations to put on this album. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s not going to trump 50 Cent sales but itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s also a better effort than Busta has put forth on his last few, and thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s worth letting it bang. --Oliver Wang\n\n\n1.
