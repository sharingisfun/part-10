And this allows us to start applying cybernetic principles to psychological and social issues. Memes are not about &quot;communication&quot; or transfer of data. Memes are programming instructions. They are tied to actions. Memes are just the packet on this network. And the packets are usually programs which get installed on the system that accepts them. That system is you and I. Because we are components in a very large system and made up of smaller systems and components the percentage of control we are generally capable of at least at first is really small because we are constrained both by our constituting components and the system of interactions within which we are embedded.\n\nWith a forward by Taylor Ellwood and introduction by Joseph Matheny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:557052ea524791b9ceead86328c8b8295f03226a","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Memetics%3A+Pirate+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"557052ea524791b9ceead86328c8b8295f03226a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,112,82,234,82,71,145,185,206,234,216,99,40,200,184,41,95,3,34,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
