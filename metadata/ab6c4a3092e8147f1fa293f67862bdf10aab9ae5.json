In Thirroul, in 1948, people chase their dreams through the books in the railway's library. Anikka Lachlan searches for solace after her life is destroyed by a single random act. Roy McKinnon, who found poetry in the mess of war, has lost his words and his hope. Frank Draper is trapped by the guilt of those his treatment and care failed on their first day of freedom. All three struggle with the same question: how now to be alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6c4a3092e8147f1fa293f67862bdf10aab9ae5","amp;dn":"The+Railwayman%27s+Wife+-+Ashley+Hay.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6c4a3092e8147f1fa293f67862bdf10aab9ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,108,74,48,146,232,20,127,31,162,147,246,120,98,189,241,10,171,154,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
