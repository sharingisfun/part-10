Gulezian's use of bottleneck slide on 12-string guitar, coupled with his command of reverse analog reverbs have made his recordings notable for their dream-like sonic atmosphere. Gulezian inhabits a musical territory between his mentor John Fahey, and his friend and colleague Michael Hedges.\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums...

He has a fluid style that shifts gears through simultaneous jazzy chording, leads, and bass lines, while weaving in and out of musical thoughts faster than a Formula One racer...\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums.\n\n_______________________________\n\nLaurence Juber - Solo Flight\nLaurence Juber - Altered Reality\nLaurence Juber - Lj\nLaurence Juber - Mosaic\nLaurence Juber &amp; Preston Reed - Grove Masters\nLaurence Juber - Naked Solos\nLaurence Juber - Winter Guitar\n\n\t\n*****************************\n\nISATO NAKAGAWA\n\nIsato Nakagawa is a japanese guitarist.\nThere's no official site available in western languages as far as I can see, so little I can say about his musical career...\n\nHe makes a great use of open tunings and percussive techniques.\n\nI associate his music to the japanese concept of &quot;shibumi&quot;: a not glaring beauty, founded on the essence of shapes, hues and materials. It's a subtle balance obtained through a search for simplicity, without useless ornamentation. They say you cant learn shibumi: you got to find it in yourself: it's a path where Nakagawa has threaded far...\n\nIt would be nice if some japanese friends would provide more albums of this marvelous artist with a western transliteration of the titles (a friend of mine did this for the album &quot;Footprints&quot;). It's sad that such an artist would remain hidden because of an alphabet difference. \n\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums.\n\n_______________________________\n\nIsato Nakagawa - Footprints\nIsato Nakagawa - Dream Catcher\nIsato Nakagawa - Rainbow Chaser\nIsato Nakagawa - Tree Circle\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d44cb50f161cd952f51d2d61f41c9263b3db0ac","amp;dn":"Guitar+Masters+09+of+16+Dykes%2C+Gulezian%2C+Juber%2C+Nakagawa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d44cb50f161cd952f51d2d61f41c9263b3db0ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,68,203,80,241,97,205,149,47,81,210,214,31,65,201,38,59,61,176,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
