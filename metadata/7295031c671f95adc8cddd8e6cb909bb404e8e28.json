But Henry adores his new bride and Katerynâ€™s trust in him grows as she unites the royal family, creates a radical study circle at the heart of the court, and rules the kingdom as Regent.\r\n\r\nBut is this enough to keep her safe? A leader of religious reform and the first woman to publish in English, Kateryn stands out as an independent woman with a mind of her own. But she cannot save the Protestants, under threat for their faith, and Henryâ€™s dangerous gaze turns on her. The traditional churchmen and rivals for power accuse her of heresyâ€”the punishment is death by fire and the kingâ€™s name is on the warrantâ€¦\r\n\r\nFrom an author who has described all of Henryâ€™s queens comes a deeply intimate portrayal of the last: a woman who longed for passion, power, and education at the court of a medieval killer.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7295031c671f95adc8cddd8e6cb909bb404e8e28","amp;dn":"The+Taming+of+The+Queen+-+Philippa+Gregory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7295031c671f95adc8cddd8e6cb909bb404e8e28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,149,3,28,103,31,149,173,200,205,221,142,108,185,9,187,64,78,142,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
