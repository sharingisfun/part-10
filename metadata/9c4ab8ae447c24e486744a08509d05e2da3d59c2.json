HowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bayou?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ considered the single most spectacularly drawn of all of ECÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horror stories, with a climax that would give body-horror king David Cronenberg nightmares.\n\nIngels specialized in depicting the unimaginable. If you ever wondered what the vengeful, decaying corpse of an elephant stomping a woman to death would look like, it's in here (&quot;Squash...Anyone?&quot;). Or living rats sewn into the bodies of a tyrannical king and queen (&quot;A Grim Fairy Tale&quot;)... or the results of injecting a &quot;poison-pen&quot; letter writer with literal poison and reducing him to, in the words of Al Feldstein's script, a &quot;foul-smelling, oozing pool of putrescence&quot; (&quot;Notes to You!&quot;). One of the two Ray Bradbury adaptations in the book, &quot;There Was an Old Woman&quot; (about a deceased crone who simply refuses to stay dead) provides the closest thing to a note of sweetness that you'll find here Ã¢â‚¬â€ perhaps with the exception of the genuinely romantic &quot;A Little Stranger!&quot; and its loving marriage between a dead vampire and a dead werewolf.\n\nSucker Bait and Other Stories features 25 classic stories from Tales from the Crypt, Shock SuspenStories, Vault of Horror, and Ingels and his &quot;Old Witch&quot; character's special showcase Haunt of Fear Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus the usual fascinating historical, critical, and biographical material.\n\n&quot;No one could draw a rotted, walking corpse like Graham Ingels.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donald Vaughan, (Florida) Sun-Sentinel\n\n&quot;I love Ingels Ã¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ George A.
