At only ten tracks, the album still manages to seem padded. Let&amp;#039;s face it, once you&amp;#039;ve heard the pop chestnut &quot;Eye of the Tiger,&quot; which has aged surprisingly well (that opening guitar sting remains potent after all these years), there&amp;#039;s really no reason to keep listening. If you do, however, you&amp;#039;ll be treated to the unique sound of not just one, but three songs from Sly Stallone&amp;#039;s lesser-known brother Frank. An actor as well as a crooner, Frankie contributes two versions of a little ditty called &quot;Take You Back&quot; and the truly hilarious (unintentionally so, of course) disco/pop number &quot;Pushin.&quot; Chock-full of howlers like &quot;Keep on pushin/don&amp;#039;t give up the fight,&quot; the song sounds like a long-lost collaboration between the Bee Gees and the Village People. Considerably less amusing are the album&amp;#039;s instrumental tunes, composed by Bill Conti; with the exception of the requisite rendition of Rocky&amp;#039;s theme song &quot;Gonna Fly Now, each of these tracks is painfully generic. Conti could have just recorded white noise in place of songs like &quot;Decision&quot; and the pointlessly long &quot;Conquest,&quot; and no one would have known the difference. It&amp;#039;s difficult to imagine anyone actually wanting to purchase Rocky III, but the CD does make a good gag gift if you have a friend who finds this kind of thing amusing. Just make sure you have a real present waiting in the wings.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Eye of the Tiger - Survivor  [3:53]\n02 - Take You Back (Tough Gym) - Frank Stallone  [1:48]\n03 - Pushin&amp;#039; - Frank Stallone  [3:11]\n04 - Decision - Bill Conti  [3:22]\n05 - Mickey - Frank Stallone  [4:40]\n06 - Take You Back - Frank Stallone  [3:40]\n07 - Reflections - Bill Conti  [2:05]\n08 - Gonna Fly Now - Bill Conti  [2:50]\n09 - Adrian - Bill Conti  [1:42]\n10 - Conquest - Bill Conti  [4:45]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e608cfe25288851af824d402662f2be91ff1e99","amp;dn":"Rocky+III+-+Soundtrack+%281982%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e608cfe25288851af824d402662f2be91ff1e99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,96,140,254,37,40,136,81,175,130,77,64,38,98,242,190,145,255,30,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
