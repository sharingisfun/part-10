Shashi Menon (Elsevier, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9780123838674\r\n\r\nPipeline Planning and Construction Field Manual aims to guide engineers and technicians in the processes of planning, designing, and construction of a pipeline system, as well as to provide the necessary tools for cost estimations, specifications, and field maintenance. The text includes understandable pipeline schematics, tables, and DIY checklists. This source is a collaborative work of a team of experts with over 180 years of combined experience throughout the United States and other countries in pipeline planning and construction. \r\n\r\nComprised of 21 chapters, the book walks readers through the steps of pipeline construction and management. The comprehensive guide that this source provides enables engineers and technicians to manage routine auditing of technical work output relative to technical input and established expectations and standards, and to assess and estimate the work, including design integrity and product requirements, from its research to completion. \r\n\r\nDesign, piping, civil, mechanical, petroleum, chemical, project production and project reservoir engineers, including novices and students, will find this book invaluable for their engineering practices.\r\nBack-of-the envelope calculations\r\nChecklists for maintenance operations\r\nChecklists for environmental compliance\r\nSimulations, modeling tools and equipment design\r\nGuide for pump and pumping station placement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b809edea4c4dcbb77e9c303b5f964f6fb75c007","amp;dn":"Pipeline+Planning+and+Construction+Field+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b809edea4c4dcbb77e9c303b5f964f6fb75c007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,128,158,222,164,196,220,187,119,233,195,3,181,249,100,246,251,117,192,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
