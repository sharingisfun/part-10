Lustig, M.D., the late Milton H. Erickson, considered by many to be the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;father\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; of modern medical hypnosis and brief strategic psychotherapy, completed an historic project ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the creation of his definitive clinical documentary. That documentary is The Artistry of Milton H. Erickson, M.D., a two-part audiovisual program showing Dr. Erickson demonstrating his innovative combination of psychotherapy and hypnotherapy with two patients. The therapy sessions were recorded in the Phoenix, Arizona, studios of KOOL-TV on April 28, 1975. Monde, the first patient, had met with Dr. Erickson for several sessions prior to the programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interview. Nick, the second patient, had never had any professional contact with Dr. Erickson. The Artistry of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. has been acclaimed throughout the world for its presentation of Dr. EricksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s subtle and powerful clinical skills and for being \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;one more of EricksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s valuable contributions to the art of therapeutic communication\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;.\n\nPart One (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Monde\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;): Dr. Erickson dramatically elicits many of the classical hypnotic phenomena and integrates them into the psychotherapy.\n\nPart Two (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Nick\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;): Dr. Erickson powerfully utilizes the trance experience to impart new attitudes and concepts to Nick and to the viewer.\n\nThe Artistry of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. has been carefully digitally re-mastered for the Silver Jubilee Edition that is now being offered for sale to individuals and institutions. The Silver Jubilee Edition is available on VHS videocassettes in the NTSC, PAL and SECAM formats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400a612658b7281d81518e357121a5b49a0eae63","amp;dn":"The+Artistry+of+Milton+H.+Erickson%2C+M.D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400a612658b7281d81518e357121a5b49a0eae63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,10,97,38,88,183,40,29,129,81,142,53,113,33,165,180,154,14,174,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
