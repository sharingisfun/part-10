His commentaries on the conquest of Gaul as well as his memoirs of the civil war he fought to dominate the Roman republic are valuable descriptions of Roman military strategy. As well, CaesarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership abilities present themselves in everything that he does.\n\nIncluded in this book is Suetonius's &quot;Life of the Divine Julius Caesar&quot; as well as a character study of the man by Thomas DeQuincy.\n\nInterspersed within this edition are not only active links to all the chapters but small explanations and summaries along the way. \n\nPart of the History Alive! series, this book allows a person who was present at the time to tell us, in his own words, what happened. When we read his words, history resounds in our minds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:300f3f2cf0de3d2fd3009a9f4500432441e4e253","amp;dn":"Julius+Caesar+-+The+Gallic+War+%26amp%3B+The+Civil+War+%28History+Eboo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"300f3f2cf0de3d2fd3009a9f4500432441e4e253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,15,63,44,240,222,61,47,211,0,154,159,69,0,67,36,65,228,226,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
