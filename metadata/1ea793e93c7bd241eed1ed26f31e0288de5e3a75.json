Reflecting a greater sense of urgency within the field of chemical defense since this event, research related to chemical warfare agents (CWAs) continues to expand at a remarkable pace.\n\nChemical Warfare Agents: Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutics, Second Edition explores the latest methods and products for preventing, diagnosing, and treating the acute and chronic effects of toxic CWA exposure. This edition citesthe key developments in chemical defense research since 2001, including new epidemiological or clinical studies of exposed or potentially exposed populations; new treatment concepts and products; improved organization of the national response apparatus in the U.S. addressing the potential for CWA terrorism; and improved diagnostic tests that enable rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nLeading researchers explain how these breakthroughs help researchers determine physiologically relevant detection thresholds and develop more effective countermeasures and national response procedures. Chemical Warfare Agents provides first responders and emergency medical teams with the most up-to-date information they need to prepare for and handle natural disasters, chemical spills, terrorism, and warfare situationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½quickly and effectively.&quot;\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea793e93c7bd241eed1ed26f31e0288de5e3a75","amp;dn":"Chemical+Warfare+Agents%3A+Chemistry%2C+Pharmacology%2C+Toxicology%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea793e93c7bd241eed1ed26f31e0288de5e3a75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,167,147,233,60,123,210,65,238,209,237,38,243,30,2,136,222,94,58,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
