But prosecutor Elsie Arnold is determined to change that.\n\nWhen she is assigned to prosecute a high-profile incest case in which a father is accused of abusing his three young daughters, Elsie is ready to become the Ozarks' avenging angel.\n\nBut as Elsie sinks her teeth into the case, everything begins to turn sour. The star witness goes missing; the girls refuse to talk about their father, who terrorizes the courtroom from the moment he enters; and Elsie begins to suspect that their tough-as-nails mother has ulterior motives. To make matters worse, Elsie receives gruesome threats from local extremists, warning her to mind her own business.\n\nWhile Elsie swears not to let a sex offender walk, she realizes the oddsÃ¢â‚¬â€and maybe the townÃ¢â‚¬â€are against her, and her life begins to crumble. But amidst all of the conflict, the safety of three young girls hangs in the balance ...\n\nA powerful debut, with the haunting atmosphere of Winter's Bone and the page-turning suspense of Alafair Burke's thrillers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d8e25703b0d603030a3137f0e6392065770f8f","amp;dn":"Nancy+Allen+-+The+Code+of+the+Hills+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d8e25703b0d603030a3137f0e6392065770f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,216,226,87,3,176,214,3,3,10,49,55,240,230,57,32,101,119,15,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
