Statics addresses the forces acting on and in mechanical objects and systems. Statics with MATLABÃ‚Â® develops an understanding of the mechanical behavior of complex engineering structures and components using MATLABÃ‚Â® to execute numerical calculations and to facilitate analytical calculations.\n\nMATLABÃ‚Â® is presented and introduced as a highly convenient tool to solve problems for theory and applications in statics. Included are example problems to demonstrate the MATLABÃ‚Â® syntax and to also introduce specific functions dealing with statics. These explanations are reinforced through figures generated with MATLABÃ‚Â® and the extra material available online which includes the special functions described.\n\nThis detailed introduction and application of MATLABÃ‚Â® to the field of statics makes Statics with MATLABÃ‚Â® a useful tool for instruction as well as self study, highlighting the use of symbolic MATLABÃ‚Â® for both theory and applications to find analytical and numerical solutions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72401268010d17e199be9490d4635268f0946305","amp;dn":"Statics+with+MATLAB+%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72401268010d17e199be9490d4635268f0946305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,64,18,104,1,13,23,225,153,190,148,144,212,99,82,104,240,148,99,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
