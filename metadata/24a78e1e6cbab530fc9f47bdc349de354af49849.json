The text presents an integrated review of algebra and trigonometry while covering fundamental calculus concepts, and providing the solid grounding in analysis and graphing that is necessary to make a successful transition to calculus. This streamlined text provides all the mathematics that students need--without bogging them down in review material or overwhelming them with too much, too soon. The authors have purposely kept this book, unlike many available Precalculus books, at a length that can be covered in one term. \n\n\n    * Precalculus, 5th Edition\n    * J.
