But if you want to hear an eccentric genius (Glenn Gould) perform these sonatas in a way that you have never heard before, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in the right place. Originally, these pieces were released on 5 LPs, but were later collected and released by Sony on 4 CDs.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a78b0a976007cfc2b8002ee8ab26e45b01c5a3d8","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+The+Piano+Sonatas+-+Gould","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a78b0a976007cfc2b8002ee8ab26e45b01c5a3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,139,10,151,96,7,207,194,184,0,46,232,171,38,228,91,1,197,163,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
