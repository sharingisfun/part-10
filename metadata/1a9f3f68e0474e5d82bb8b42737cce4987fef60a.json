Just learning this P2P stuff so bear with me. This is the original version so this ones' copyright has expired and is legal. see comments for why. I have a lot of survival books but this is the one of the few I actually printed on my printer. hehe, If the world as we know it ends, (TWAWKI) this is one book I don't want to rely on my laptop and solar energy to get to. Call me paranoid if you want but shit is happening that is unprecedented and if I am going to make it, I need to know this stuff...or at least have access to it without electricity...\n\nPlease seed as I have comcast and host several other ebooks and am limited to 250 Gb total capacity. I will seed until 200Gb then I gotta stop for a bit as I want to have internet the rest of the month.  This book has been flying off the shelf lately and I may not have enough capacity... Thanks for understanding and if you think it is useful and virus free, please post a comment on your thoughts as others would like to know your feelings. I think we are all going to need these skills, I am not happy about that but that don't mean shit. If you can't provide for yourself, you can't do anyone any good anywhere. This is the stuff you need to know if you can't afford monumental prices or even buy stuff from the market anymore. Will it happen? I don't have a clue but luck favors the prepared...\n\nOriginally published in 1909, &quot;Handy Farm Devices&quot; is more than an engaging trip down memory lane. For any small farmer or homesteader, the techniques and devices described in detail are just as useful, durable, and fully functional today as they were 75 years ago. You will learn to build a portable chicken coop, a stone boat (for moving stone), a lightweight orchard ladder, gates that don't sag, and a handy wood splitter, as well as rudimentary farm structures, well houses, bee hives, a baby's cradle, a cheese press and much more. The charming, turn-of-the-century language and useful and inspirational quotes from Shakespeare, the Bible, Bacon, Longfellow and many others make this book a delight to read. --Mark A. Hetts  --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\nCountry Living Magazine, April, 1997\nA reprint of a 1910 classic, this well-illustrated 288-page paperback is filled with clever ideas and useful information. Even those of us who'd rather pass on making a movable brooder house for chickens of fashioning a baby cradle from an old barrel will find wisdom in this thrift-conscious and often environmentally wise celebration of self-sufficiency","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9f3f68e0474e5d82bb8b42737cce4987fef60a","amp;dn":"Handy+farming+devices+and+how+to+make+them","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9f3f68e0474e5d82bb8b42737cce4987fef60a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,159,63,104,224,71,78,93,130,187,139,66,115,124,206,73,135,254,246,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
