The first episode of season 1, ripped from dvd format. This is actually the second official episode with the Pilot episode being &quot;Come What May&quot; which will be up soon! It took me forever to get this ripped and in order right. The DVD they made for it wasn't constructed properly. Each ACT/commercial break was separated into titles instead of one consecutive a single title with the ACTs separated as chapters.\n\nEpisode Description:\n\nIn an adventure that spans centuries, Captain Kirk fights alongside a U.S.S. Enterprise from the past to stop the devastating &quot;Doomsday Wars&quot; that should never have happened. In a universe forever changed by those events, the crew of the Enterprise must once again battle the powerful juggernaut known as the &quot;Doomsday Machine.&quot; Guest starring Original Series alumni Barbara Luna, Malachi Throne. and William Windom as Commodore Matthew Decker.
