Prior to 1973, Pink Floyd maintained a relentless gigging schedule and by the time they came to record &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; had already created many of the basic tracks. &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; would be the first Pink Floyd (post Syd Barrett) album where Roger Waters would supply all the lyrics around a concept: The Circle of Life. With the timeless qualities of its production and musicality, allied to the hypnotic evocation of its central themes - alienation, paranoia, madness, war and death, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; would become the album that would dominate the 70's and 80's (with a record number of 741 consecutive weeks in the Billboard 200).\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 550 MiB for 49mn 0s 312ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : DVD5\nLanguage          : English UK\nSuntitles         : Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish\nGenre             : Rock/Music/Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 333 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 352 (1.818) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:954e1de92e33ad54acf1b1a43413648525055586","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd-The+Making+of+The+Dark+Side+of+the+Moon+%282003%29.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"954e1de92e33ad54acf1b1a43413648525055586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,78,29,233,46,51,173,84,172,241,177,164,52,19,100,133,37,5,85,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
