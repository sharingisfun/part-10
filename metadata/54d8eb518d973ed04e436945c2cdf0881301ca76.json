He received his Master of Green Chemistry as specialization from University of Toulouse. His current research interest is the integration of innovative techniques (e.g. ultrasound and microwave) and agro-based solvents (e.g. vegetable oils, terpenes, etc.) for the green extraction of bioactive compounds from natural bio-resources, which leads to greener processing procedures and novel value-added end-products with great potential in food, cosmetics, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nAnne-Sylvie Fabiano-Tixier is associate professor of Chemistry in GREEN Extraction Team at Avignon University (France) and ORTESA LabCom Naturex-UAPV. She holds Ph.D. degree in Chemistry of Biomolecules from the University of Toulouse. Her expertise is extraction techniques (especially microwave, ultrasound and green solvents) and antioxidant activity applied to food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic domains. More than 25 scientific peer-reviewed papers, 3 patents and 50 communications in events document her research activity.\n\nFarid Chemat is a full Professor of Chemistry at Avignon University, Director of GREEN Extraction Team (alternative techniques and solvents), co-director of ORTESA LabCom research unit Naturex-UAPV, and scientific coordinator of Ã¢â‚¬Å“France Eco-ExtractionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ dealing with dissemination of research and education on green extraction technologies. His main research interests are focused on innovative and sustainable extraction techniques, protocols and solvents (especially microwave, ultrasound and bio-based solvents) for food, pharmaceutical, fine chemistry, biofuel, and cosmetic applications. His research activity is documented by more than 140 scientific peer-reviewed papers, 9 books and 7 patents\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2014 edition (12 August 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319084488\nISBN-13: 978-3319084480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d8eb518d973ed04e436945c2cdf0881301ca76","amp;dn":"%5BYing+Li+%2C+Anne-Sylvie+Fabiano-Tixier+%2C+Farid+Chemat%5DEssential+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d8eb518d973ed04e436945c2cdf0881301ca76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,216,235,81,141,151,62,208,78,67,105,69,194,205,240,136,19,1,202,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
