(bass) and Grzegorz Wawrze?czuk (keyboards), during the fall of communism in Poland. They gained a wide popularity in Poland in the early nineties, mainly after releasing the &quot;MÃƒÂ³j Dom&quot; album, with the hit title song, which was still during their garage and semi-professional days. They also gained some local popularity amongst the Polish-speaking citizens in the United States, where they lived and worked for few months. After signing a professional contract back in Poland, they released a few albums which didn&amp;#039;t prove to be commercially successful (except for the &quot;MÃƒÂ³j Dom&quot; follow-up, which was &quot;IRA 1993&quot;), and the band disbanded afterwards.\nThe name &quot;IRA&quot; comes from a latin word IRA, meaning anger (this was the band founders&amp;#039; intention), however most people think they used an acronym for Irish Republican Army.\n\nmore on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRA_%28Polish_heavy_metal_band%29\n\n1989 - Ira\n1992 - Moj Dom\n1993 - 1993\n1994 - Live\n1994 - Znamie\n1995 - Ogrody\n1998 - Artur Gadowski\n2000 - Artur Gadowski - G.A.D\n2002 - Ballady\n2002 - Tu i Teraz\n2004 - Live 15-lecie\n2004 - Ogien\n2007 - Londyn 8.15\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:635c7a9bbc86d93dc7e6085a250b0378d5cbffac","amp;dn":"IRA+-+Discography+%281989-2007%29+%7Bmp3%40VBR%5D+%5BPL%5D+Hard+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"635c7a9bbc86d93dc7e6085a250b0378d5cbffac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,92,122,155,188,134,217,61,199,230,8,90,37,11,3,120,213,203,255,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
