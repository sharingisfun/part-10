No one has ever been able to determine their origins, and even the Basques' language, EuskeraÃ¢â‚¬â€the most ancient in EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â€is related to none other on earth. For centuries, their influence has been felt in nearly every realm, from religion to sports to commerce. Even today, the Basques are enjoying what may be the most important cultural renaissance in their long existence.\n\nMark Kurlansky's passion for the Basque people and his exuberant eye for detail shine throughout this fascinating book. Like Cod, The Basque History of the World blends human stories with economic, political, literary, and culinary history into a rich and heroic tale.\n\nAmong the Basques' greatest accomplishments:\n\n    ExplorationÃ¢â‚¬â€the first man to circumnavigate the globe, Juan Sebastian de Elcano, was a Basque and the Basques were the second Europeans, after the Vikings, in North America\n    Gastronomy and agricultureÃ¢â‚¬â€they were the first Europeans to eat corn and chili peppers and cultivate tobacco, and were among the first to use chocolate\n    ReligionÃ¢â‚¬â€Ignatius Loyola, a Basque, founded the Jesuit religious order\n    Business and politicsÃ¢â‚¬â€they introduced capitalism and modern commercial banking to southern Europe\n    RecreationÃ¢â‚¬â€they invented beach resorts, jai alai, and racing regattas, and were the first Europeans to play sports with balls\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Basque-History-World-Nation/dp/0140298517/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348155572&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+basque+history+of+the+world&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Basque-History-World-Nation/dp/0140298517/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348155572&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+basque+history+of+the+world&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:763a32378e2711de8c927a6850022f194bb20f07","amp;dn":"The+Basque+History+of+the+World%3A+The+Story+of+a+Nation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"763a32378e2711de8c927a6850022f194bb20f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,58,50,55,142,39,17,222,140,146,122,104,80,2,47,25,75,178,15,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
