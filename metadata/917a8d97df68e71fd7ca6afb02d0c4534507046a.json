These two periods correspond neatly to the house bands in residence at Channel One, with the Revolutionaries providing the rhythms behind the first phase, and Roots Radics powering the second. This two-disc history of the studio shows that whatever the differences were between early and later Channel One releases, a crisp, clear sound was the constant, and the hits here from the Mighty Diamonds (&quot;I Need a Roof,&quot; &quot;Right Time&quot;), Barrington Levy (&quot;Dances Are Changes&quot;), Delroy Wilson (&quot;Sharing the Night Together&quot;), the Jays (a cover of &quot;Queen Majesty&quot; by the Impressions), John Holt (&quot;Up Park Camp&quot;) and Sugar Minott (&quot;Babylon&quot;) all feature that same sharp, fresh feel and tone, making this a wonderful introduction to a vital Jamaican institution. ~ Steve Leggett\n\nRecording information: Channel One Studio, Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nEditor: Paul Shields.\n\nPhotographers: Dave Hendley; Simon Buckland.\n\nPersonnel: Eradication Squad (horns).\n\nLiner Note Author: Dave Hendley.\n\n\n\tReggae Anthology: The Channel One Story CD DISC 1:\n\n\t1.\tI Need a Roof - The Mighty Diamonds\n\t2.\tDon't Smoke the Seed - DJ Frankie Jones\n\t3.\tRight Time - The Mighty Diamonds\n\t4.\tNatty Dread Have Credentials - Don Carlos\n\t5.\tNatty Burial - Lone Ranger\n\t6.\tWoman Is Like a Shadow - The Meditations\n\t7.\tRoad Block - Sammy Dread\n\t8.\tBurial - Revolutionaries\n\t9.\tThings &amp; Time - Wailing Souls\n\t10.\tCokane in My Brain - Dillinger (DJ mix)\n\t11.\tFar East - Barry Brown\n\t12.\tC.B. 200 - Dillinger\n\t13.\tWelding - I-Roy\n\t14.\tWorries in the Dance - Frankie Paul\n\t15.\tHerbman Smuggling - Yellowman\n\t16.\tDances Are Changes - Barrington Levy\n\t17.\tShow Me That You Love Me Girl - Sugar Minott\n\t18.\tI Know Myself - Ernest Wilson\n\t19.\tTruly (DJ Mix) - Ranking Trevor\n\t\t\n        Reggae Anthology: The Channel One Story Songs DISC 2:\n\n\n\t1.\tTruly - The Jays\n\n\t2.\tHard to Confess - The Tamlins\n\n\t3.\tBallistic Affair - Leroy Smart\n\n\t4.\tSatisfaction - John Holt\n\n\t5.\tRagnampiza - Dillinger\n\t6.\tM.P.L.A. - Revolutionaries\n\t7.\tDeath in the Arena - Revolutionaries\n\t8.\tPrema Ballerina - Clint Eastwood\n\t9.\tSharing the Night Together - Delroy Wilson\n\t10.\tBabylon - Sugar Minott\n\t11.\tSmoke Ganja Hard - Little John\n\t12.\tFade Away - Junior Byles\n******\t13.\tQueen Majesty - The Jays/Jays &amp; Ranking Trevor  ***** yaho yaho\n\t14.\tWithout Love - Leroy Smart\n\t15.\tUp Park Camp - John Holt\n\t16.\tYaho - The Jays\n\t17.\tRoach Killer - Super Chick\n\t18.\tM. 16 - Lone Ranger\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡  Don t smoke the seeds : 1st  : u'll kill the breed \n\n                           2nd  : it is not smokable anyway\n\nas some might not believe (do you believe this ? arf )\n\nSÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£D KILLERZ MUST SUFFERZ !
