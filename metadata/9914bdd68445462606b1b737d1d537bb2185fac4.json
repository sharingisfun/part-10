When the mysteriously alluring Sissy Young becomes her field hockey coach, Faith finds a compassionate spirit and much-needed mother figure. Little does she know that Sissy is the head of a centuries-old witches' coven that uses the fruit of an ancient cherry tree in a secret ritual that restores life to the dead and dying. Offering to cure her father in exchange for a child, Sissy strikes a bargain with Faith, who suddenly finds herself pregnant with a baby that's growing at an alarming rate. But with the clock to the child's birth ticking down and the true intention of Sissy's plans for humanity becoming more apparent, Faith and her father must stand together in order to save both their lives.\r\n\r\nDirector: David Keating\r\nWriter: Brendan McCarthy\r\nStars: Naomi Battrick, Patrick Gibson, Sam Hazeldine\r\nGenres: Horror\r\nCountry: Ireland\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: Cherry.Tree.2015.BDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO                                             \r\n\r\n SOURCE: o0o (Scene)                                               \r\n\r\n ViDEO: 1900 kbps XviD               \r\n\r\n RESOLUTiON: 720x384                           \r\n\r\n RUNTiME: 1h25m33sec      \r\n\r\n SUBTiTLES: N/A                               \r\n\r\n AUDiO: 448 CBR AC-3        \r\n\r\n LANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\n GREETS: Srkfan &amp; AQOS \r\n \r\n NOTES: Enjoy.           \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aSRZ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aSRe \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aSR4 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aSRB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9914bdd68445462606b1b737d1d537bb2185fac4","amp;dn":"Cherry.Tree.2015.BDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9914bdd68445462606b1b737d1d537bb2185fac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,20,189,214,132,69,70,38,6,177,183,55,209,213,55,187,33,133,250,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
