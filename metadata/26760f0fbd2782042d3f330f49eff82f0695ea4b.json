Each maneuver that you perform, such as flapping like a bird, or tumbling like a baton, changes its color. Match the ship's color with a shape's to pass through it, hit an obstacle as the wrong color and fail. The pace is unrelenting and, in a blink, the challenge resets without penalty. Flywrench is accompanied by an epic electronic music soundtrack curated by Daedelus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26760f0fbd2782042d3f330f49eff82f0695ea4b","amp;dn":"Flywrench","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26760f0fbd2782042d3f330f49eff82f0695ea4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,118,15,15,189,39,130,4,45,63,51,15,73,239,248,47,6,149,234,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
