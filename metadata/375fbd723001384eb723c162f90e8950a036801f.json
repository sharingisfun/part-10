These are the songs that most everyone will associate Dean Martin with. When Dean's name is brought into a conversation you immediately start to hum to yourself songs like &quot;That's Amore&quot;, &quot;Memories Are Made of This&quot;, &quot;Return To Me&quot;, and the unfogetable &quot;Volare&quot;. If you remember one or two of these tunes, and I'm very sure you, maybe even more, this compilation is the one to get. It'll even give you a taste of some of the classic Italian songs Dean recorded during his career. He just always seemed so relaxed whether he was singing or acting. I've been a very big fan of Deans' for years and a very big record collector as well and this compilation is now part of my collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375fbd723001384eb723c162f90e8950a036801f","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+Dean+Martin+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375fbd723001384eb723c162f90e8950a036801f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,95,189,114,48,1,56,78,183,35,193,98,249,14,137,80,160,54,128,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
