David Rasche (Sledge Hammer) was a overly violent, over-the-top detective who frequently talked and did everything with his gun. The charm of the show stems from his bone-headed clashes with Captain Trunk and partner Detective Doreau. Also his every attempt to solve problems with guns makes the show absolutely hilarious.\n\nHe doesn't like criminals, small children or babies. This NOT for the overly sensitive or politically correct types. This series was no where near the aforementioned attributes. The premise of the show was to show how silly violence could be in solving every problem that could possibly arise. Yes, it trivialized death. Yes, it dealt with guns in light-hearted way. Yes, there were random incidences of unnecessary violence. But that is where the humor is at. If you don't understand that statement, you'll never get this series so just walk away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3a687b4c8f1a9454a99a20a8f40bb7a4911b8a7","amp;dn":"Sledge+Hammer+-+Complete+Season+2+-+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3a687b4c8f1a9454a99a20a8f40bb7a4911b8a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,166,135,180,200,241,169,69,74,153,162,10,143,64,187,122,73,17,184,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
