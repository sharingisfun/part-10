After being separated from his friends in a bandit attack, Tatsumi unsuccessfully attempts to enlist in the army and is swindled out of his money in the Capital. He is then taken in by a noble family, but when an assassin group called Night Raid attacks, he learns that his noble hosts actually intended to torture and kill him as they had done with his friends. As a result, he joins Night Raid, which consists of the swordswoman Akame, a young woman armed with a huge pair of scissors named Sheele, the string manipulator Lubbock, the armored warrior Bulat, the sniper Mine, the beast fighter Leone and their leader Najenda, a former general of the imperial army. Night Raid is also part of the revolutionary forces assembled to overthrow Prime Minister Honest, who manipulates the young emperor for his personal gain despite the rest of the nation falling to poverty and strife.\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nVideo Source: Blu ray\r\nVideo Codec: H.265/HEVC\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nCodec: AC3\r\nTrack 1: English 5.1ch\r\nTrack 2: Japanese Stereo\r\n\r\nSubtitles\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\n Please Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:652b5b759fcfc20ec8f6b531b84b787f5b87dade","amp;dn":"Akame+Ga+Kill%21+1-24+%28BDRip+1080p+AC3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"652b5b759fcfc20ec8f6b531b84b787f5b87dade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,43,91,117,159,207,194,14,200,246,181,49,184,75,120,127,91,135,218,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
