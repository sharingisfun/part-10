Featuring stories of interest to gun enthusiasts of every kind â€“ from competitive shooters and hunters to reloaders and gun collectors â€“ the monthly magazine also delivers impartial reviews of rifles, shotguns, handguns and shooting equipment, technical analysis and expert advice, state and federal legislative updates, and regional reports on local events and facilities.\r\n\r\nAmerican Rifleman is a United States-based monthly shooting and firearms interest publication, owned by the National Rifle Association (NRA). It is the 33rd most-widely distributed consumer magazine and the NRA's primary magazine.[2] The magazine has its headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia.\r\n\r\nArthur Corbin Gould, an avid shooter and member of the Massachusetts Rifle Association, published The Rifle in 1885 as an effort to focus discussion on the sport of rifle shooting.[4] The Rifle later changed its title to Shooting &amp; Fishing in 1888, branching out into other outdoor sports. In 1894, while the magazine was titled Shooting and Fishing, Gould attended the National Rifle Association matches held at Sea Girt and was impressed with the level of competition, leading him to write several editorials urging the public to join.[5] This call eventually led to the revitalization of the National Rifle Association and established a Board of Directors to help manage the nationwide organization.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ee93669af6d1724df5474b6c9290d06eb334e0","amp;dn":"American+Rifleman+-+September+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ee93669af6d1724df5474b6c9290d06eb334e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,238,147,102,154,246,209,114,77,245,71,75,108,146,144,208,110,179,52,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
