She gave it her authorization.\n\nThe Jack Kirby Collector was first published in limited quantities as a small, black-and-white magazine focusing on Kirby artwork and articles by Morrow and a few fellow collectors, and fans.  As each issue grew in size, it began to include rare and/or previously unpublished Kirby art, as well as uninked pencil versions of published art.  Soon, the magazine was being published on better paper, with glossy color covers.  New and veteran comics artists were given the chance to ink reproductions of Kirby's original pencil work.  Each issue carried the notation, &quot;Fully Authorized by the Kirby Estate.&quot;  The magazine went on to be nominated for several awards.\n\nThe Morrows have also launched fundraiser projects to fund the preservation of the thermostatic copies of Kirby's uninked pencils by scanning over 5,000 pages and cleaning them for future researchers and readers.\n\nThis torrent contains ALL 59 issues of this publication.  Kirby fans can't get enough of this highly acclaimed magazine for Kirby fans!\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5472c1a2eba0d09ba3b16138f3af0e6b08b4ae","amp;dn":"The+Jack+Kirby+Collector+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5472c1a2eba0d09ba3b16138f3af0e6b08b4ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,84,114,193,162,235,160,208,155,163,177,97,56,243,175,14,107,8,180,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
