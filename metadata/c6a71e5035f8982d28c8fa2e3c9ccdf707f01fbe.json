Born in 1972 in the small Jamaican village of St. Mary's, Marion Hall signed to the Jamaican grassroots label VP Records and debuted in 1994 with Lover Girl. Lady Saw soon proved she was up to the challenge of Jamaica's rudest boys by teaming up with Shabba Ranks on the single &quot;Want It Tonight.&quot; Her second album, Give Me the Reason, was followed by 1997's Passion, which featured her X-rated vocal swaggering on duets with Shaggy (&quot;Mr. Lover Lover&quot;) and Beenie Man (&quot;Healing&quot;). The album was her most popular, prompting the 1998 release of two greatest-hits packages, Collection and Raw: The Best of Lady Saw. In 2004 she released Strip Tease, then three years later the ambitious Walk Out. In 2010 she formed her own label, Divas Records, which released her album My Way that same year.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nWhen she burst on the scene in 1994, no one would have believed that the gutsy, gruff, and extremely lewd Lady Saw would still be relevant some fifteen years later. So much ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpum pumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ talk and so many cheap thrills usually make for a short-lived career, but this dancehall diva is all that and more. My Way is the rock solid proof as Saw offers a dizzying mix of hard sex and girl power over backing tracks that run the gamut. Anyone familiar with reggae singer GyptianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mega-hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHold YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will recognize the chilled riddim underneath SawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great answer song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMe Hold You,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but if you want furious, jump to the wild highlight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTightaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which utilizes the over-the-top ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCosa NostraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ riddim for controlled chaos. Many of the cuts come from the production house of Marion Hall who pushes the envelope with the fabulous space disco beats he lays on the catty and fierce ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYour Chick.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The title cut is arguably the singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best roots cut to date, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œParty till DecemberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an infectious pop number you can play in mixed company, and the closing slow jam ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is strong, poignant, and honest. While the X-rated elements of My Way canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be oversold, it is important to note that the versatile Saw is able to adjust from porno to political to personal like Prince in his early days. Highly recommended, just have your ID ready. \n\n01.Every Way Mi Go\n02.Your Chick\n03.Bigga Than\n04.He's At My House\n05.My Way\n06.Part Till December\n07.Tighta\n08.Cyaan Get Me\n09.Crazy Love\n10.Me Hold Yuh\n11.Muscle Control\n12.5 Minutes\n13.Facebook\n14.I Can't Wait\n15.I'm A Woman\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a71e5035f8982d28c8fa2e3c9ccdf707f01fbe","amp;dn":"Lady+Saw+-+My+Way+%282010%29+Reggae+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a71e5035f8982d28c8fa2e3c9ccdf707f01fbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,167,30,80,53,248,152,45,40,200,250,46,60,156,205,247,7,240,31,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
