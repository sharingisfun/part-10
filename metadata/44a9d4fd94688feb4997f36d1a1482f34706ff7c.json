They are some of the most challenging violin pieces to master, but Perlman tears through them like he is playing Chop Sticks. \n\nWhen Perlman shines he radiates like a supernova. For Sarasate, this is the most you will find of him by Perlman on one CD; it's a shame he didn't devote the whole CD to Sarasate! \n\nIf you really want a CD to listen to some excellent violin playing this is it.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44a9d4fd94688feb4997f36d1a1482f34706ff7c","amp;dn":"Itzhak+Perlman+-+Virtuoso+Violin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44a9d4fd94688feb4997f36d1a1482f34706ff7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,169,212,253,148,104,143,235,73,151,243,109,26,20,130,243,71,6,255,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
