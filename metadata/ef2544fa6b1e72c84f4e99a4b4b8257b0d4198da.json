A young man catches the spinning sun with a lasso to slow it down and lengthen the day. A giant boar raises the earth from beneath the sea with its enormous tusks. These are just a few of the thousands of myths belonging to cultures from around the world. They are tales of powerful gods and goddesses, of fearless heroes facing down frightening monsters, of ingenious tricks and epic battles.\nBut these powerful stories do more than just widen our eyes, catch our breaths, and stretch our imaginations. They are the keys to truly grasping the ways that principles, rituals, codes, and taboos are woven into the fabric of a particular society or civilization. It's through myths that we can answer these and other fundamental questions:\n\nHow was the universe created, and why?\nWhat is the purpose of evil in the world?\nWhy is human society organized the way it is?\nHow did natural features like rivers, mountains, and oceans emerge?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2544fa6b1e72c84f4e99a4b4b8257b0d4198da","amp;dn":"TTC+Myth+in+human+history","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef2544fa6b1e72c84f4e99a4b4b8257b0d4198da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,37,68,250,107,30,114,200,79,78,153,164,180,184,37,123,13,65,152,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
