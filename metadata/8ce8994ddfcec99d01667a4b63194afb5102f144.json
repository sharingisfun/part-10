The book begins with an introduction to the fundamental aspects of electrode electron transfer and methods for the electrochemical measurement of organic molecules. It then goes on to discuss organic electrosynthesis of molecules and macromolecules, including detailed experimental information for the electrochemical synthesis of organic compounds and conducting polymers. Later chapters highlight new methodology for organic electrochemical synthesis, for example electrolysis in ionic liquids, the application to organic electronic devices such as solar cells and LEDs, and examples of commercialized organic electrode processes. Appendices present useful supplementary information including experimental examples of organic electrosynthesis, and tables of physical data (redox potentials of various organic solvents and organic compounds and physical properties of various organic solvents). \n\n\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (24 September 2014)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00NXRMBZO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce8994ddfcec99d01667a4b63194afb5102f144","amp;dn":"%5BToshio+Fuchigami+%2C+Mahito+Atobe%2CShinsuke+Inagi%5DFundamentals+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce8994ddfcec99d01667a4b63194afb5102f144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,232,153,77,223,206,201,157,1,102,122,75,99,25,74,251,81,2,241,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
