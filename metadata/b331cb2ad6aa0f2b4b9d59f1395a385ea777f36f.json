In this classic and unique volume that answers this question, William Blum serves up a forensic overview of U.S. foreign policy spanning sixty years. For those who want the details on our most famous actions (Chile, Cuba, Vietnam, to name a few), and for those who want to learn about our lesser-known efforts (France, China, Bolivia, Brazil, for example), this book provides a window on what our foreign policy goals really are.\n\nIf you flip over the rock of American foreign policy of the past century, this is what crawls outÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ invasions Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ bombings Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ overthrowing governments Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ occupations Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ suppressing movements for social change Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ assassinating political leaders Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ perverting elections Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ manipulating labor unions Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ manufacturing Ã¢â‚¬Å“newsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ death squads Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ torture Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ biological warfare Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ depleted uranium Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ drug trafficking Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ mercenaries Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a pretty picture.
