Lynne began to\nwrite the album in response to criticisms from his father, a classical\nmusic lover, who said that Electric Light Orchestra's repertoire &quot;had\nno tune&quot;. The influence of the Beatles is prevalent, especially in the\nmelody of the verse of &quot;Mister Kingdom&quot; which resembles the Beatles'\nAcross the Universe.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01 - Eldorado Overture [02:12]\n  02 - Can't Get It Out Of My Head [04:21]\n  03 - Boy Blue [[05:19]\n  04 - Laredo Tornado [05:29]\n  05 - Poor Boy (The Greenwood) [02:57]\n  06 - Mister Kingdom [05:29]\n  07 - Nobody's Child [03:56]\n  08 - Illusions In G Major [02:37]\n  09 - Eldorado [05:17]\n  10 - Eldorado Finale [01:34]\n  11 - Eldorado Instrumental Medley [07:56]\n  12 - Dark City [00:46]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Electric Light Orchestra\nGenre: Symphonic rock / progressive rock\nAlbum Release Year: 1974\nNumber of Tracks: 12\nTotal Duration: 48 Minutes\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 882 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original CD Release\nConverter: EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheet, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 304 MB\n\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8daf46cbdc991d3c86dcb0df3bd9cf0b5382c853","amp;dn":"Electric+Light+Orchestra+-+Eldorado+1974+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8daf46cbdc991d3c86dcb0df3bd9cf0b5382c853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,175,70,203,220,153,29,60,134,220,176,223,59,217,207,11,83,130,200,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
