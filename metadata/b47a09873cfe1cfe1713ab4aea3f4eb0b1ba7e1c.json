Gaza gets their name from the heavily feudal area of the middle east, often referred to as the gaza strip, that resides along the Mediterranean Sea. Gaza's music is heavily technical, feauturing temp changes, complex time signatures, and intricate riffs. Their music has an angry, misanthropic feel to it. \n\nGaza has released two full-length albums. They are:\n-I Don't Care Where I Go When I die (2006)\n-He Is Never Coming Back (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47a09873cfe1cfe1713ab4aea3f4eb0b1ba7e1c","amp;dn":"Gaza+Discography+%282006-2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47a09873cfe1cfe1713ab4aea3f4eb0b1ba7e1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,122,9,135,60,254,28,254,23,19,171,74,234,63,78,176,177,186,126,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
