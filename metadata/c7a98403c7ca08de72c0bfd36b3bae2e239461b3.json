Released from prison, Brando learns that Malden has become a wealthy and influential lawman. Brando thirsts for revenge, but bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike. In the meantime, Brando spitefully seduces Malden's adopted daughter Pina Pellicer. After participating in a botched holdup, Brando is publicly whipped by the powerful Malden. When Brando's old gang accidentally kills a child during another holdup, Malden has the perfect excuse to eliminate the troublesome Brando once and for all by hanging him. But that's not what happens at all. Stripped to its fundamentals, One-Eyed Jacks is a workable western, worthy of perhaps 90 minutes' running time. But when Marlon Brando succeeded Stanley Kubrick in the director's chair, he allowed the film's 60-day shooting schedule to stretch into six months, and delivered a finished product running in excess of four hours! The current 141-minute version of One Eyed Jacks isn't as ponderous as some critics have claimed, but is still too much of a good thing. While Brando the director isn't precisely in the Kubrick class, Brando the actor delivers one of his finest and most focused performances (though he is upstaged throughout by Karl Malden).\n\nFile Name .............: One-Eyed.Jacks.cd1.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 732,669,952 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:12:34 (104396 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 672x368 () [=] [=1.826]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1309 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.221 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 32 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave ............: 96 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nFile Name .............: One-Eyed.Jacks.cd2.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 735,117,312 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:08:26 (98446 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 672x368 () [=] [=1.826]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1235 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.208 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave ............: 96 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\nIMDB: tt0055257\n\nEnglish audio, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by discogail","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7a98403c7ca08de72c0bfd36b3bae2e239461b3","amp;dn":"Marlon+Brando+-+One-Eyed+Jacks+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7a98403c7ca08de72c0bfd36b3bae2e239461b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,169,132,3,199,202,8,222,114,192,191,211,107,59,174,46,35,148,97,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
