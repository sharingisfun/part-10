The publication will firstly comprise a collection of refereed papers representing a breadth of activity and research around the issues of drawing within the broad context of art and design activity. The second dimension of the book will be an examination of the drawing processes of high profile practitioners. \n\nThe publication will encompass the best contemporary investigation of a subject pivotal to art and design activity, and should be recognized as a fundamental text for students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce9c4341d2d2afdc607a897a640c6c616e26dc2","amp;dn":"Drawing+-+The+Process","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce9c4341d2d2afdc607a897a640c6c616e26dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,233,196,52,29,45,42,253,198,7,168,151,166,64,198,198,22,226,109,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
