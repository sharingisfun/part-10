When challenged to a drag, the women accept, but are forced     \n    off of a bridge. It appears that all are drowned, until Mary, quite      \n    some time later, amazingly emerges from the river. After recovering,     \n    Mary accepts a job in a new town as a church organist, only to be        \n    dogged by a mysterious phantom figure that seems to reside in an old     \n    run-down pavilion. It is here that Mary must confront the personal       \n    demons of her spiritual insouciance.                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
