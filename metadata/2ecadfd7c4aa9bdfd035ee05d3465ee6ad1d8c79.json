Some writings were published in the New Yorker in summer 2006. A larger assortment was published as a book by Random House last September. The film drew upon the submissions by soldiers for the book. It's a remarkable portrait of troops at war - the complexities, doubts, and fears - written with honesty [...]. The visual approaches range from poet Brian Turner reading directly to camera, to archival footage, to an animated 'graphic novel', to a still photo sequence shot by photographer Antonin Kratochvil.&quot;\n\n-&gt; Documentary nominated for Oscar in 2008. Won Special Jury Award at Florida Film Festival.\n-&gt; Voices-over, among others, by Robert Duvall, Aaron Eckhart, Blair Underwood, and Beau Bridges.\n\n============================================================\n\n--&gt;&gt; SCREENSHOTS, G-SPOT QUALITY REPORT, AND MORE NFO HERE: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=20243&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=20243&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(Scroll down a little bit)\n\n============================================================\n\nReport fake torrents, spam torrents, and spam comments here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy uploads:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=20243&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=20243&lt;/a&gt;\n\n============================================================\n\nSeed a bit after you finish your download so that others can have it too. \nOther than that, enjoy.\nroom101bellboy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ecadfd7c4aa9bdfd035ee05d3465ee6ad1d8c79","amp;dn":"Operation+Homecoming.Writing+the+Wartime+Experience+%282007%29%5B101%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ecadfd7c4aa9bdfd035ee05d3465ee6ad1d8c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,202,223,215,196,170,155,223,208,53,238,5,211,70,94,230,173,29,140,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
