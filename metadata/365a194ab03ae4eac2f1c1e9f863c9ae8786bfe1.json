Trumpeter Donald Byrd and a septet that also includes tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, guitarist Kenny Burrell, and pianist Herbie Hancock are joined by an eight-voice choir directed by Coleridge Perkinson. The arrangements by Duke Pearson are masterful and one song, &quot;Cristo Redentor,&quot; became a bit of a hit. This is a memorable effort that is innovative in its own way, a milestone in Donald Byrd's career.
