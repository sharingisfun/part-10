Understanding Secure Sockets Layer takes the complicated subject of using TLS/SSL with public key infrastructure (PKI) for trusted encryption and identity verification, and breaks it down into easy-to-understand components that entry-level IT technicians, consultants, and support staff need to knowÃ¢â‚¬â€regardless of the types of computers, users, or networks supported. Join author Sean Colins for a focused and approachable course that will extend your knowledge of common SSL concepts and practices, including:\n\n\t* SSL communications\n\t* Certificate authorities\n\t* Public key infrastructures\n\t* Symmetric and asymmetric key pairs\n\t* Cryptographic hash functions\n\t* Encryption algorithms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cafea4ffb508a0fa00b5557135e4de6468eb633d","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Understanding+Secure+Sockets+Layer+-+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cafea4ffb508a0fa00b5557135e4de6468eb633d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,254,164,255,181,8,160,250,0,181,85,113,53,228,222,100,104,235,99,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
