Join the unlikely  duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventures as they leave their mark on monumental events and keep history from becomingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ well history...\n\nI have all 91 Episodes which were all a part of the Rocky and Bullwinkle show which ran for 5 years (form 1959 to 1964).  I am posting 5 torrents - one for each year.\n\nPlease note:  Since Peabody and his boy Sherman were incorporated in the RB show, I have cut out just their segments - each program runs for about 5 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdee3584f166e4bdf4ce1c32f2ab106865063769","amp;dn":"Mr.+Peabody+and+Sherman+-+Season+2+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdee3584f166e4bdf4ce1c32f2ab106865063769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,238,53,132,241,102,228,189,244,206,28,50,242,171,16,104,101,6,55,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
