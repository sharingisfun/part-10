As of December 4, 2007, a slim majority of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes judged the film &quot;rotten&quot;, with the consensus view being that the film &quot;Has strong performances, but relies too heavily on holiday movie clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s.&quot;[3] The score on Metacritic is 63 out of 100, &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.[4]Despite some bad reviews the movie ranked number 2 in the box office (next to Enchanted). The film became a box office hit after opening with $17,958,183.[5] It went on to gross $49,121,934 domestically on a budget of just $13 million.[6]\n\nThis is the story of a solidly middle-class African-American family that reunites for Christmas for the first time in seveal years. Ma&amp;#039;dere (Loretta Devine) is the Matriarch who&amp;#039;s Los Angeles home is where the vast majority of the story takes place. As with any family gathering there are topics that are best not discussed. When they are discussed here they end up in fights -verbal or physical (an excellent sister-on sister catfight stands out here). One sister is encouraging the siblings to sell the family dry cleaning business and split the profits. One bother is running from loan sharks. One brother is AWOL from the Marine Corps and One sister has brought along the man she&amp;#039;s dating at a historically Black college. Despite what the trailers and TV commercials may lead you to think this is not a warm syurpy comedy. There are dramatic moments, violence and course language. It is however very much a slice-of-life that not enough hollywood features present. This family, warts and all, is definitely not a hollywood feel-good film with blackfaces. It is authentic in it&amp;#039;s portrayal of themes facing African-Americans in particular but Americans in general.\n\n\nHAVE A NICE MOVIE !!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92b47a1f92ee9d29519bedf00332d1c8db8d795","amp;dn":"This.Christmas.FRENCH.DVDRiP.SHANOU13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92b47a1f92ee9d29519bedf00332d1c8db8d795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,43,71,161,249,46,233,210,149,25,190,223,0,51,45,28,141,184,215,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
