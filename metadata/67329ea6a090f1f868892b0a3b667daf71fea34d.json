Here are all 21 Videos and also is the PDF workbook he has included. \n\nHere is from his site \n&quot;Dear Friend,\n\nI have some important questions for you. Be honest with yourself as you answer them...\n\nAre you terrified of evoking a demon, because you're afraid it could hurt you?\n\n   Have you ever wanted to evoke an angel, but felt nervous that you'd make a beginner's mistake and upset the spirit?\n   Are you intimidated by the ridiculously complicated rituals inside most grimoires?\n   Have you tried evocation, but never saw or heard the entity... and you felt skeptical about whether the spirit even showed up?\n   Are you at the point where you've had such negative experiences with evocation that you're about ready to just give up?\n\nThe truth is, I already know you said YES to some of my questions.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause every highly successful evocator I know had these EXACT experiences.\n\nOut of all the topics inside the world of magick and the occult, evocation has suffered the most misinformation, superstition, and fear-mongering.\n\nSo if you're struggling just to get BASIC success with evocation, then I have exciting news for you... you're normal!\nI Unveil The Holy Grail Of Evocation\n\nI discovered an extremely valuable secret, that annihilates conventional occult wisdom.\n\nThrough years of personally showing thousands of magicians how to go from novice to magus with evocation, I'm convinced that the art of summoning spirits has an exponential learning curve.\n\nIn other words, the more you do it, the better your results get.\n\nThis obvious truth goes against the traditional belief that only magicians from special bloodlines can perform evocation.\n\nIn my experience, it's NOT a matter of genes. It's a matter of PRACTICE.\n\nThere's a certain transformation of consciousness you NEED to undergo in ritual to finally awaken your omnipotent power, evoke spirits to physical appearance, and cause change according to your will.\n\nThis &quot;Transfiguration of Consciousness&quot; is the veritable Holy Grail of evocation, because it forever unlocks your power to summon spirits at will.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67329ea6a090f1f868892b0a3b667daf71fea34d","amp;dn":"E.A.+Koetting+MAstering+Evocation+Full+Program+Vids+%26amp%3B+Compan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67329ea6a090f1f868892b0a3b667daf71fea34d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,50,158,166,160,144,241,248,104,137,43,10,59,102,125,175,113,254,163,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
