In case anyone reading this is unaware of this bedrock work of American history, let me offer some background. Anyone reading this who might have considered majoring in American History would have been required not only to READ this tome, but just about to commit it to memory. This is AS fundamental and bedrock a work as exists in the American Canon of historical books. In 1835, French Nobleman Alexis De Tocqueville published in France his work examining the American experiment with self-rule. In its day, this was more read than ANY book is today, with the possible exception of the Bible. If you wish to gain a functional understanding of what America looked like between the Revolution and the Civil War (1776-1860), this is the place to start. As both a student and teacher of American history, I cannot stress enough the importance of this particular book. Anyone of ANY political bent who claims the title of expert in American History is full of it if they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know this book. Sadly, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll take a bet that most of the victims of what passes for American education these days have never even heard of it.\n\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville, 1805-1859 De la DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mocratie en Amerique (Democracy in America)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.top-audiobook-downloads.com/title.aspx?titleId=5405&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.top-audiobook-downloads.com/title.aspx?titleId=5405&lt;/a&gt;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlexis de Tocqueville, a young French aristocrat, captured the essence of nineteenth-century America in his penetrating work, Democracy in America. The democratic concept of equality was emerging as a political reality in America, and it threatened the aristocracy of Europe; it produced a society of individualists hungry for self improvement. In this classic treatise, Tocqueville weighed the advantages of democracy against its dangers. He asked: Is the tendency toward equality a tendency toward liberty? Can the majority be restrained to protect the freedom of individuals and minorities?\n     \nIn pondering these questions, Tocqueville presented an unsurpassed picture of American government, culture, and attitudes. He proclaimed a new nation with a new theory of human interaction: America, ruled by the will of the majority.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_America&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_America&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDe la dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mocratie en AmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rique (published in two volumes, the first in 1835 and the second in 1840) is a classic French text by Alexis de Tocqueville on the democratic institutions of the United States in the 1830s and its strengths and weaknesses. A &quot;literal&quot; translation of its title is Of Democracy in America, but the usual translation of the title is simply Democracy in America. It is regarded as a classic account of the democratic system of the United States and has been used as an important reference ever since. The work is regarded as a seminal text in economics and a key work in the foundation of economic sociology.\nIn 1831, twenty-five-year-old Alexis de Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont were sent by the French government to study the American prison system. They arrived in New York City in May of that year and spent nine months traveling the United States, taking notes not only on prisons, but on all aspects of American society, including the nation's economy and its political system. The two also briefly visited Canada, spending a few days in the summer of 1831 in what was then Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec) and Upper Canada (modern-day Ontario).\nAfter they returned to France in February 1832, Tocqueville and Beaumont submitted their report, entitled Du systÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nitentiaire aux ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tats-Unis et de son application en France, in 1833. When the first edition was published, Beaumont, sympathetic to social injustice, was working on another book, Marie, ou, L'esclavage aux Etats-Unis (two volumes, 1835), a social critique and novel describing the separation of races in a moral society and the conditions of slaves in America.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSummary\n\nThe primary focus of Democracy in America is an analysis of why republican representative democracy has succeeded in the United States while failing in so many other places. Tocqueville seeks to apply the functional aspects of democracy in America to what he sees as the failings of democracy in his native France.\n\nTocqueville speculates on the future of democracy in the United States, discussing possible threats to democracy and possible dangers of democracy. These include his belief that democracy has a tendency to degenerate into &quot;soft despotism&quot; as well as the risk of developing a tyranny of the majority. He observes that the strong role religion played in the United States was due to its separation from the government, a separation all parties found agreeable. He contrasts this to France where there was what he perceived to be an unhealthy antagonism between democrats and the religious, which he relates to the connection between church and state.\n\nInsightful analysis of political society was supplemented in the second volume by description of civil society as a sphere of private and civilian affairs.\n\nTocqueville's views on America took a darker turn after 1840, however, as made evident in Aurelian Craiutu's Tocqueville on America after 1840: Letters and Other Writings.\n\nImportance\n\nDemocracy in America was published in numerous editions in the 19th century. It was immediately popular in both Europe and the United States, while also having a profound impact on the French population. By the twentieth century, it had become a classic work of political science, social science, and history. It is a commonly assigned reading for undergraduates of American universities majoring in the political or social sciences, and part of the introductory political theory syllabus at Oxford.\n\nTocqueville's work is often acclaimed for making a number of predictions that were eventually borne out. Tocqueville correctly anticipates the potential of the debate over the abolition of slavery to tear apart the United States (as it indeed did in the American Civil War). On the other hand, he predicts that any part of the Union would be able to declare independence. He also predicts the rise of the United States and Russia as rival superpowers (which they did become after World War II], with Russia as the central component of the Soviet Union.)\n\nAmerican democracy was seen to have its potential downside: the despotism of public opinion, the tyranny of the majority, conformity for the sake of material security, the absence of intellectual freedom which he saw to degrade administration and bring statesmanship, learning, and literature to the level of the lowest. Democracy in America predicted the violence of party spirit and the judgment of the wise subordinated to the prejudices of the ignorant.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69dd78b8f5a3234b2d0d778e31fafabaef459e92","amp;dn":"Alexis+de+Tocqueville+-+Democracy+in+America+%5Bunabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69dd78b8f5a3234b2d0d778e31fafabaef459e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,221,120,184,245,163,35,75,45,13,119,142,49,250,250,186,239,69,158,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
