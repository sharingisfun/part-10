The chief philosophical work included here is the 3-volume ONTOLOGY OF SOCIAL BEING (1978-80), a systematic treatment of dialectical philosophy in its materialist form.\n\nLukÃƒÂ¡cs was also an influential literary critic because of his theoretical developments of realism and of the novel as a literary genre.  His important work in literary criticism began early in his career, with THE THEORY OF THE NOVEL (1971), a seminal work in literary theory and the theory of genre.  The book is a history of the novel as a form, and an investigation into its distinct characteristics.\n\nIn SOUL AND FORM (1974), LukÃƒÂ¡cs provides a series of critical readings of Rudolph Kassner, Soren Kierkegaard, Novalis, Theodor Storm, Stefan George, and others.\n\n\nThe following 5 books are in PDF format:\n\n* THE ONTOLOGY OF SOCIAL BEING, VOL. 1: Hegel's False and His Genuine Ontology (Merlin Press, 1978).
