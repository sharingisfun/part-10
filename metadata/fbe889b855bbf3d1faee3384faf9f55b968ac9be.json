(documentary)\n\nFrom Senator John Decamp:\nIn mid-1993, after The Franklin Cover-Up had been circulating for almost a year, \nthe British-based TV ... all station, Yorkshire Television, sent a top-notch team \nto Nebraska to launch its own investigation of the Franklin case. Yorkshire had a \ncontract with the Discovery Channel to produce a documentary on the case for American \ntelevision.\n\nFinally, the big day came. Their documentary was to air nation-wide on the \nDiscovery Channel on May 3, 1994. It was advertised in the TV Guide and in \nnewspapers for that day. But no one ever saw that program. At the last minute, \nand without explanation, it was pulled from the air. It was not shown then, and \nhas never been broadcast anywhere since.\n\nI have a copy of that program, which arrived anonymously in my mail in \nlate 1995. When I watched this pirated copy, I could see clearly why the program \nhad been suppressed. Conspiracy of Silence proved, beyond doubt, that the essential \npoints I had stressed in the book (and more) were all true.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbe889b855bbf3d1faee3384faf9f55b968ac9be","amp;dn":"Conspiracy+of+Silence+Illuminati+Pedophiles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbe889b855bbf3d1faee3384faf9f55b968ac9be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,232,137,184,85,187,243,209,250,238,51,132,250,249,245,91,150,138,201,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
