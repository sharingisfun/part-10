Was it a dream.\nPicked up me body for the ride of a lifetime is what it seemed.\nHope got me started. Put you to the centre, so it seemed.\nDon?t you hurry ?cause you?ll reach your goals, is what it reads.\nGot caught in the rain and it washed all my senses down the drain.\nDrop me a line when you?re given the time and we?ll talk some more.\n\nWoke up this morning with a head full of snow.\nWas it a dream? Don?t you worry cause you?ll reach your goals is what it reads.\n\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life now\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life now \n\nPicked up my mail to the 1040 exit to the streets\nDrew some money then shook hands with the angel next to me.\nCaught in the rain and it washed all my senses down the drain.\nWoke up this morning with a head full of snow. Was it a dream?\n\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life now\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life\n\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life now\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life\n\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life now\nThis is the time of you life\nThis is the time of you life\n\n?.To fade?.\n\n\nTrack 4: Written by Oakenfold, Osborne, Davis, Smith, Larsen and Wright.

Its Anita Baymont Hunter Thompson?s assistant, I&amp;#039;m going through the messages, just getting back to you to let you know that Hunter did get the CD&amp;#039;s, I&amp;#039;ve listened to them and I&amp;#039;m excited and Hunter has listened to them and ... he is interested. So eh we&amp;#039;ll give you call back in a couple of days, yeah so um great stuff we&amp;#039;ll talk soon thanks bye.&quot;\n\nHunter: &quot;Let me just read this.&quot;\n\n&quot;Nixon?s spirit will be with us for the rest of our lives whether your are me or Bill Clinton or you or Kurt Cobain or Bishop Tutu or Keith Richards or Aimee Fisher or Boris Yeltsin?s daughter or her finance&amp;#039;s sixteen year old beer drunk brother with his braided goatee with his whole like a thunder cloud right in front of him.&quot;\n\n&quot;This is not a generational thing you don&amp;#039;t even have to know who Richard Nixon was to be a victim of his ugly nazi experiments.&quot;\n\n&quot;He has poisoned our water for ever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest, but he also shit in our nest and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory as a brand. By disgracing and degrading the presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream...&quot;\n\nTrack 7: Written by Oakenfold, Gray &amp; Torrini.
