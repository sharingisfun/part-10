Caught with his pants down, he finds himself bucked right off the PBR tour until he can get his act together.\n\nHollywood actress Ava Dumond became the tabloids' favorite target when her longtime boyfriend was outed as gay. Now she wants a place to lay low and a chance to prove to herself that she can satisfy a red-blooded man between the sheets. The sexy, rugged cowboy she finds holed up in her Wyoming hideaway seems like the answer to her every fantasy.\n\nBut Chase has sworn off women. Forever. Or at least a month. Whichever comes first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba90f7978e6a6d8483c2156bf08c9850ceb4f85","amp;dn":"Lorelei+James-Chasin+Eight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba90f7978e6a6d8483c2156bf08c9850ceb4f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,169,15,121,120,230,166,216,72,60,33,86,191,8,201,133,12,235,79,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
