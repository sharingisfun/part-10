The untold story is that birthrates in Muslim nations are declining faster than anywhere elseÃ¢â‚¬â€at a rate never before documented. Europe, even in its decline, may have the resources to support an aging population, if at a terrible economic and cultural cost. But in the impoverished Islamic world, an aging population means a civilization on the brink of total collapseÃ¢â‚¬â€ something Islamic terrorists know and fear.\n\nMuslim decline poses new threats to America, challenges we cannot even understand, much less face effectively, without a wholly new kind of political analysis that explains how desperate peoples and nations behave.\n\nIn How Civilizations Die, David P. GoldmanÃ¢â‚¬â€author of the celebrated Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpenglerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ column read by intelligence organizations worldwideÃ¢â‚¬â€reveals how, almost unnoticed, massive shifts in global power are remaking our future.\n\nGoldman reveals:\nHow extinctions of peoples, cultures, and civilizations are not unthinkableÃ¢â‚¬â€but certain\nHow for the first time in world history, the birthrate in the West has fallen below replacement level\nWhy birthrates in the Muslim world are falling even faster\nWhy the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arab SpringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the precursor of much more violent change in the Islamic world\nWhy looming demographic collapse may encourage Islamic terrorists to Ã¢â‚¬Å“go for brokeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nHow the United States can survive the coming world turmoil\n\nIn How Civilizations Die, David P. Goldman has written an essential book for understanding what lies in the future for America and the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33507567e6a29b173a618ef377fcf8173ca6d004","amp;dn":"David+P.+Goldman+-+How+Civilizations+Die+%5BV6%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33507567e6a29b173a618ef377fcf8173ca6d004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,80,117,103,230,162,155,23,58,97,142,243,119,252,248,23,60,166,208,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
