It has the same real 3-oscillator flexibility as the award winning K-Station, with powerful filters, 8-voice polyphony, simultaneous Novation FX.\n\nProgramming V-Station is simple. All the primary controls are on the main screen. Recall a named factory preset, tweak it and instantly save it in any of the 400 program locations. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find additional functions and controls on three further tabs.\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Uninstall previous versions.\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Install the setup...\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it! Done.\n\n\n\n                         3Nj0Y!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fc3702a09671974118fe80ceac2dc66ec2ef8f","amp;dn":"Novation+V-Station+v2.0+-+R2R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fc3702a09671974118fe80ceac2dc66ec2ef8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,252,55,2,160,150,113,151,65,24,254,128,206,172,45,198,110,194,239,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
