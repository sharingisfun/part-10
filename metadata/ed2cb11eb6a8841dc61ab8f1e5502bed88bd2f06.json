Of all the major composers of the late Romantic era, Brahms was the one most attached to the Classical ideal as manifested in the music of Haydn, Mozart, and especially Beethoven; indeed, Hans von BÃƒÂ¼low once characterized Brahms' Symphony No. 1 (1855-1876) as &quot;Beethoven's Tenth.&quot; As a youth, Brahms was championed by Robert Schumann as music's greatest hope for the future; as a mature composer, Brahms became for conservative musical journalists the most potent symbol of musical tradition, a stalwart against the &quot;degeneration&quot; represented by the music of Wagner and his school. Brahms' symphonies, choral and vocal works, chamber music, and piano pieces are imbued with strong emotional feeling, yet take shape according to a thoroughly considered structural plan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed2cb11eb6a8841dc61ab8f1e5502bed88bd2f06","amp;dn":"Brahms+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed2cb11eb6a8841dc61ab8f1e5502bed88bd2f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,44,177,30,182,168,132,29,198,26,184,241,229,80,43,237,136,189,47,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
