Almost one-fourth of the images are hand colored, superb examples of a rich art form long since vanished. The Japan of this book too has disappeared, but author and compiler Terry Bennett has put together a unique portrait of the country at perhaps its most decisive turning point, a nation about to abandon its traditional ways and enter the modern age.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6d82220bf0559cec5c7b1e0abbfc9f088eb2501","amp;dn":"Early+Japanese+Images+%28Photography+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6d82220bf0559cec5c7b1e0abbfc9f088eb2501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,216,34,32,191,5,89,206,197,199,177,224,171,191,201,240,136,235,37,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
