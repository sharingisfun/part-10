It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.[/b]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nm6EriX.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d9119b3aa38829f81d641bb9a6342ff3f3bdb1","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.2005.8x10.In.The.Forest.Of.The.Night.HDTV.x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d9119b3aa38829f81d641bb9a6342ff3f3bdb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,217,17,155,58,163,136,41,248,29,100,27,185,166,52,47,243,243,189,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
