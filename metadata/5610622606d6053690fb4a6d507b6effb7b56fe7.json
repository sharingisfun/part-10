It was originally written in 1961 by members of an unsuccessful group called The Chateaus and recorded in late 1969 by former Chateaus members Paul Leka, Gary DeCarlo, and Dale Frashuer for use as a throwaway B-side for a now-forgotten single.  When the execs at Mercury heard the song they wanted it used for the A-side rather than the originally intended single.  Leka, Decarlo, and Frashuer were outraged and refused to allow their names as performers on the release, although they agreed to take credit for writing the song.  The imaginary band name &quot;Steam&quot; was dredged up and the single released.  When the song went to number one, &quot;Steam&quot; was expected to tour and perform.  Leka put together a six-member band for appearances sake and &quot;Steam&quot; released a few more singles.  &quot;I've Gotta Make You Love Me&quot; made the charts in 1970 but missed the top 40.\n\n1.
