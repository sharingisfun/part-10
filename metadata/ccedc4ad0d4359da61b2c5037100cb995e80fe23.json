He has been a major figure in music for five decades and has had immense influence on popular music.[1][2] Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of his early songs such as &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot; became anthems for the US civil rights[3] and anti-war[4] movements. Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan proceeded to revolutionize perceptions of the limits of popular music in 1965 with the six-minute single &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;.[5]\n\nHis lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie,[6] Robert Johnson,[7] Hank Williams, and the performance styles of Buddy Holly and Little Richard,[8] Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored numerous distinct traditions in American songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from folk, blues and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly, to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.[9]\n\nDylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.[1]\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.[10][11] As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008, a road called the Bob Dylan Pathway was opened in the singer's honor in his birthplace of Duluth, Minnesota.[12] The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for &quot;his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Band \n\n\nThe Band was an acclaimed and influential roots rock group. The original group consisted of Canadians Rick Danko (bass guitar, double bass, fiddle, trombone, vocals), Garth Hudson (keyboard instruments, saxophones, trumpet), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, baritone saxophone, vocals), Robbie Robertson (guitar, vocals), and American Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, vocals). All five members were notable musicians in their own right.\nThe members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, The Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963. Upon leaving Hawkins in 1964, they were briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet with sax player Jerry Penfound being the sixth member, then Levon and the Hawks after Penfound's departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name Canadian Squires, but returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for Atco later in 1965.[1] At about the same time, Bob Dylan recruited Helm and Robertson for two concerts, then the entire group for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966.[2] They also joined him on the informal recordings that later became The Basement Tapes.\nBecause they were always &quot;the band&quot; to various frontmen, Helm said the name &quot;The Band&quot; worked well when the group came into its own[3] and left Saugerties, New York, to begin recording their own material. They recorded two of the most acclaimed albums of the late 1960s: their 1968 debut Music from Big Pink (featuring the single &quot;The Weight&quot;) and 1969's The Band. In 2004, &quot;The Weight&quot; was ranked the 41st best song of all time in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.[4]\nThe Band broke up in 1976, but reformed in 1983 without founding guitarist Robbie Robertson. Although the Band was always more popular with music journalists and fellow musicians than with the general public, they have remained an admired and influential group. The group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989[5] and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.[6] In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them #50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time,[7] and in 2008, they received the Grammy's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\n\n\nThe Basement Tapes 1975\n\n\nThe Basement Tapes is a 1975 studio album by Bob Dylan and The Band. The songs featuring Dylan's vocals were recorded in 1967, eight years before the album's release, at houses in and around Woodstock, New York, where Dylan and the Band lived. Although most of the Dylan songs had appeared on bootleg records, The Basement Tapes marked their first official release.\n\nDuring his world tour of 1965ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“66, Dylan was backed by a five-member rock group, the Hawks, who would subsequently become famous as the Band. After Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident in July 1966, the Hawks' members gravitated to the vicinity of Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan was concealed from the public's gaze during an extended period of convalescence in 1967, they recorded more than 100 tracks together, comprising original compositions, contemporary covers and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde On Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties.\n\nWhen Columbia Records prepared the album for official release in 1975, eight songs recorded solely by the BandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in various locations between 1967 and 1975ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½were added to sixteen songs taped by Dylan and the Band in 1967. Overdubs were added in 1975 to songs from both categories. The Basement Tapes was critically acclaimed upon release, and reached number seven on the Billboard 200 album chart. Subsequently, the format of the 1975 album has led critics to question the omission of some of Dylan's best-known 1967 compositions and the inclusion of material by the Band that was not recorded in Woodstock.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nCD 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Odds and Ends&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:47\n2.\t&quot;Orange Juice Blues (Blues for Breakfast)&quot; (Richard Manuel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n3.\t&quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n4.\t&quot;Yazoo Street Scandal&quot; (Robbie Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n5.\t&quot;Goin' to Acapulco&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n6.\t&quot;Katie's Been Gone&quot; (Manuel, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n7.\t&quot;Lo and Behold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n8.\t&quot;Bessie Smith&quot; (Rick Danko, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n9.\t&quot;Clothes Line Saga&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n10.\t&quot;Apple Suckling Tree&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n11.\t&quot;Please Mrs. Henry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n12.\t&quot;Tears of Rage&quot; (Dylan, Manuel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n\n\n\nCD 2 \n\n\n13.\t&quot;Too Much of Nothing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n14.\t&quot;Yea!
