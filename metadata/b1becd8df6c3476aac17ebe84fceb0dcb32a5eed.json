Sharp, honest, funny, sad, and surprisingly optimistic, White Russians is an audio adaptation of Christian A. Dumais' autobiographical look at the schizophrenic decade leading into the new millennium through the eyes of those who drank through it. Wonderfully acted and beautifully realized with music and sound effects, this album of seven short stories captures all the madness and glory of a generation lost and out of control with none of the hangover. \n\nIncludes seven tracks: ILLUSION OF SWING / MUTED PORN / THE MARIACHI / EMPTY SOCRATES / $24.99 / THIS IS NOT FOR YOU / PAYING THE TAB. Approx. 70 min. Produced by SCREAMING SOUND.\n\nIf you enjoy these stories, then you might like my new book of short stories, available now at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Lonely-Countries-Christian-Dumais/dp/1440490880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1232139703&amp;sr=8-1\n\n\nEMPTY ROOMS LONELY COUNTRIES collects a decade's worth of short stories, wandering through two continents, five countries and multiple universes to explore love, loss and redemption in the 21st century.
