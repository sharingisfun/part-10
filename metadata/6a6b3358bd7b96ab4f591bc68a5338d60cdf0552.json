Originally produced for Russian television, it gives an unprecedented eastern perspective on the war's most decisive and bloody theater, all depicted through stunning computer-generated imagery and reconstructions.\n\nIt was a conflict of staggering scale and savagery. [u]Four out of five German soldiers killed in World War Two died on the Eastern Front[/u]. The Red Army suffered ten times as many dead as the Western Allies combined. The total dead on all sides was more than 30 million, most of them civilians. The war was seen by both sides as a struggle for existence. It meant that both Hitler and Stalin were prepared to accept losses on any scale to achieve final victory.\n\nSoviet Storm tells the story of this titanic clash of arms blow by blow. Across 18 episodes we explore some of the largest and most dramatic battles of history, from the murderous fighting amidst the ruins of Stalingrad to the horrors of the Siege of Leningrad, to the roaring of tank engines across the Russian steppe at the Battle of Kursk. We take close-up looks at the key personalities and decisive weapons of the war, including legendary tanks like the T-34 and the Tiger, and lesser known Soviet weapons including the B-5 howitzer ('Stalin's Sledgehammer') and the Ilyushin 2 ('The Flying Tank').\n\nProduction: [url=&quot;http://starmediafilm.com/en/historical/velikaya_vojna&quot;]Star Media Group[/url]\nYear of production: 2011\nNumber of episodes: 18\nDirected by:Anna Grazhdan\nWritten by:Artem Drabkin, Aleksey Isaev \nProduction designer:Valeriy Babich\nMusic by:Boris Kukoba\nProducers: Valeriy Babich , Vlad Ryashin , Sergey Titinkov , Konstantin Ernst \nPremiere:29/03/2010 (Russia), 03/05/2010 (Ukraine), 20/06/2011 (UK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The History channel)\n\nEpisode 1: Operation Barbarossa\nEpisode 2: Kiev, 1941\nEpisode 3: The Defence of Sevastopol\nEpisode 4: The Battle for Moscow \nEpisode 5: The Siege of Leningrad\nEpisode 6: Rzhev\nEpisode 7: Stalingrad\nEpisode 8: The Battle for Caucasus\nEpisode 9: The Battle of Kursk\nEpisode 10: The Liberation Of Ukraine\nEpisode 11: Operation Bagration\nEpisode 12: War in the Air\nEpisode 13: War in the Sea\nEpisode 14: The Partisan Movement\nEpisode 15: Secret Intelligence of the Red Army\nEpisode 16: The Battle for Germany\nEpisode 17: Battle of Berlin\nEpisode 18: War Against Japan\n\nTechnical info for files:\n\nFormat : MPEG-4/AVC 1080p\nBit rate : ~2 300 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : ~7 000 Kbps\nWidth : 1 920 pixels\nHeight : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nAudio : AAC\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6b3358bd7b96ab4f591bc68a5338d60cdf0552","amp;dn":"Soviet+Storm+-+WW2+in+the+East","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a6b3358bd7b96ab4f591bc68a5338d60cdf0552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,107,51,88,189,123,150,171,79,89,27,198,138,83,56,214,12,223,5,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
