Alan Bennett and Michael Palin voice Mole and Rat.\n\nTHIS VERSION IS NOT at TPB yet, the others are different versions. Chack and compare!\n\nIn segmented mpg format, plays on VLC (but you might have difficulty burning it).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c1c738619884195f819384705c3303b1e8918f5","amp;dn":"Wind+in+the+Willows+%281995%29+Vanessa+Redgrave+animated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c1c738619884195f819384705c3303b1e8918f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,28,115,134,25,136,65,149,248,25,56,71,5,195,48,59,30,137,24,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
