Christopher Wallace (Jamal Woolard) is seen sitting at his chair smoking. People, including Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) and Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs (Derek Luke), move to the music on the dance floor. Moments later, Biggie, Combs, and friends are driving away from the party. They stop at a red light, while Lil' Cease (Marc John Jefferies) is flirting with women outside. A black Chevrolet Impala pulls up and someone inside fires a single shot at Biggie. The film then flashes back to Biggie's childhood in the early 1980s, recounting his tough upbringing in Brooklyn. Biggie (Christopher &quot;CJ&quot; Wallace, Jr.) writes several rap songs, enduring the ridicule of some classmates. Biggie then starts selling drugs at the height of the crack epidemic. In 1990, after winning an important rap battle, he meets Kimberly Jones (Naturi Naughton) for the first time. Kim is attracted to Biggie instantly and they later have sex in her apartment. However, Kim is afraid to start a new relationship because of a past relationship when she was abused. Biggie assures her that he won't break her heart and they begin dating (even though he is dating Jan also). Prior to this, Biggie's mother, Voletta (Angela Bassett), throws him out of the house after discovering his involvement with drugs and his getting-ready to be a father.\n\nGenre: Biography | Drama | Music\n\nRelease date: 13 February 2009 (UK)\n\n\nCode:\n\nJamal Woolard\nAngela Bassett\nDerek Luke\nAnthony Mackie\nNaturi Naughton\nAntonique Smith\nMarc John Jefferies\nJulia Pace Mitchell\nChristopher &quot;CJ&quot; Wallace, Jr.\n\n\n\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Notorious 2009 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2086.73 MiB\nDuration: 2h 8mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 262 Kbps\n\n\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/67594128560490132978.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/67594128560490132978.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/42301079991180476057.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/42301079991180476057.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97453931663521217489.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97453931663521217489.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/46030973601582936628.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/46030973601582936628.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/58560270475264058612.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/58560270475264058612.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrackers\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInfo Hash: C70EA2F0ED8C85B34219E274D788BE33F2CA9CFE\n\nFollow HDScene RG on Facebook \n\nFollow HDScene RG on twitter   [url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c70ea2f0ed8c85b34219e274d788be33f2ca9cfe","amp;dn":"Notorious+2009++720p+BRRip+x264+aac+vice%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c70ea2f0ed8c85b34219e274d788be33f2ca9cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,14,162,240,237,140,133,179,66,25,226,116,215,136,190,51,242,202,156,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
