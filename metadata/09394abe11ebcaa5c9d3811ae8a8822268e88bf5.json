Here, along the world's tenth largest river, which rises in Tibet and joins the sea in Vietnam, traditions mingle and exquisite food prevails.\n\nAward-winning authors Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid followed the river south, as it flows through the mountain gorges of southern China, to Burma and into Laos and Thailand. For a while the right bank of the river is in Thailand, but then it becomes solely Lao on its way to Cambodia. Only after three thousand miles does it finally enter Vietnam and then the South China Sea.\n\nIt was during their travels that Alford and DuguidÃ¢â‚¬â€who ate traditional foods in villages and small towns and learned techniques and ingredients from cooks and market vendorsÃ¢â‚¬â€came to realize that the local cuisines, like those of the Mediterranean, share a distinctive culinary approach: Each cuisine balances, with grace and style, the regional flavor quartet of hot, sour, salty, and sweet. This book, aptly titled, is the result of their journeys.\n\nThe book's more than 175 recipes for spicy salsas, welcoming soups, grilled meat salads, and exotic desserts are accompanied by evocative stories about places and people. The recipes and stories are gorgeously illustrated throughout with more than 150 full-color food and travel photographs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09394abe11ebcaa5c9d3811ae8a8822268e88bf5","amp;dn":"Hot+Sour+Salty+Sweet+-+Jeffrey+Alford.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09394abe11ebcaa5c9d3811ae8a8822268e88bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,57,74,190,17,235,202,165,201,211,129,26,232,168,130,34,104,232,139,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
