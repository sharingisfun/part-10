With its refreshing candor and lyrical prose, To Explain the World is a delightful celebration of our passionate drive for understanding.&quot;\r\nâ€”Brian Greene \r\n\r\nA masterful commentary on the history of science from the Greeks to modern times, by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinbergâ€”a thought-provoking and important book by one of the most distinguished scientists and intellectuals of our time.\r\n\r\nIn this rich, irreverent, and compelling history, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg takes us across centuries from ancient Miletus to medieval Baghdad and Oxford, from Platoâ€™s Academy and the Museum of Alexandria to the cathedral school of Chartres and the Royal Society of London.
