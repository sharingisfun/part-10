Additionally there are auxiliary landing areas including the Burrows Island Lighthouse Helipad, Allan Island private airstrip and the 21H Skyline water landing area.\n\nThe entire city of Anacortes is represented, and also the Deception Pass Bridge (specifically for your low-flying adventures!), the detailed refinery area nearby and many other POIs. The scenery seamlessly integrates with KVBS Skagit Regional airport also from Orbx, and uses 7cm, 15cm and 60cm photoreal imagery.\n\nThis is Jarrad Marshall's finest hour for sure!\n\nFEATURES:\n\n    Ultra-detailed modelling and textures for Anacortes Airport (74S) \n    All 3D models include baked ambient occlusion\n    Six highly-detailed custom static aircraft\n    60cm coverage for city of Anacortes, Anacortes Refinery, Deception Pass State Park, Allan and Burrows Islands\n    15cm/custom ground poly (FSX native) for 74S Airport\n    Auxiliary landing areas nearby: Burrows Island Lighthouse Helipad, Allan Island private airstrip, 21H Skyline water landing \n    City of Anacortes and detailed refinery area included \n    Ultra-detailed Deception Pass Bridge (specifically for your low-flying adventures!) \n    Seamless integration with Hugh Johnston's upcoming Skagit Regional Airport (KBVS)\n\nNOTE: This is an Orbx FTX airport, and as such a copy of Orbx FTX NA BLUE Pacific Northwest must be installed prior to use.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce25675c0fd9ac391e61ff6026c88640f0f8b179","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+74S+-+Anacortes+%28ORBX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce25675c0fd9ac391e61ff6026c88640f0f8b179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,37,103,92,15,217,172,57,30,97,255,96,38,200,134,64,240,248,177,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
