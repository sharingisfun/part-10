In a matter of years, the skies of the imaginary world were filled with strange mutants, aliens, and vigilantes: Batman, Wonder Woman, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and the X-Menâ€”the list of names as familiar as our own. In less than a century, theyâ€™ve gone from not existing at all to being everywhere we look: on our movie and television screens, in our videogames and dreams.

In this exhilarating work of a lifetime, Morrison draws on art, science, mythology, and his own astonishing journeys through this shadow universe to provide the first true history of the superheroâ€”why they matter, why they will always be with us, and what they tell us about who we are . . . and what we may yet become","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48b3f08209167be53cc93acec24b4771f602a36","amp;dn":"Grant+Morrison+-+Supergods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48b3f08209167be53cc93acec24b4771f602a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,139,63,8,32,145,103,190,83,204,147,172,236,36,180,119,31,96,42,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
