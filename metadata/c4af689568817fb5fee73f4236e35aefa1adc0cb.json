But I'm even more surprised this title has been blessed with so much endearment. At the time, all I could do was pour my heart and soul into creating the score for Chrono Trigger, and it came with great angst and gratification. I couldn't even fathom how the audience would perceive it, nor did it cross my mind. But after 13 years, the reality that there are so many people who are still listening proves that every moment of my effort was worthwhile, and that the words and thoughts from everyone had a massive impact in my music composition and for that I am truly grateful.\n\nMusic is a strange thing; for each person who listens there is a different interpretation. I would be honored if those who have continued to love these songs would continue to love and feel the music of Chrono Trigger in their own way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4af689568817fb5fee73f4236e35aefa1adc0cb","amp;dn":"Chrono+Trigger+DS+-+Orchestra+Extra+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4af689568817fb5fee73f4236e35aefa1adc0cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,175,104,149,104,129,127,181,254,231,63,66,54,227,90,239,161,173,192,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
