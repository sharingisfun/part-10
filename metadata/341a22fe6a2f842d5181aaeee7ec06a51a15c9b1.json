Marshalling the thievesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ guilds under his control, he declares war against the Trifect, an allegiance of wealthy and powerful nobles.\n\nAaron Felhorn has been groomed since birth to be ThrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heir. Sent to kill the daughter of a priest, Aaron instead risks his own life to protect her from the wrath of his guild. In doing so, he glimpses a world beyond poison, daggers, and the iron control of his father.\n\nGuilds twist and turn, trading allegiances for survival. The Trifect weakens, its reputation broken, its money dwindling. The players take sides as the war nears its end, and Thren puts in motion a plan to execute hundreds.\n\nOnly Aaron can stop the massacre and protect those he lovesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAssassin or protector; every choice has its consequences.\n\n\n\n                          Book 01 - A Dance of Cloaks\n\n                          Book 02 - A Dance of Blades\n\n                          Book 03 - A Dance of Death\n\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341a22fe6a2f842d5181aaeee7ec06a51a15c9b1","amp;dn":"Shadowdance+Trilogy+by+David+Dalglish+%28Complete%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341a22fe6a2f842d5181aaeee7ec06a51a15c9b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,26,34,254,106,47,132,45,81,129,170,238,231,236,6,165,26,21,201,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
