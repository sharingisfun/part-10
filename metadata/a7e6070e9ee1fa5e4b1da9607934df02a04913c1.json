Interviewees include his sister Gaye Temple, his biographer Tony Peake, Tilda Swinton, Ron Peck, Nigel Terry, Peter Tatchell and Simon Fisher Turner. Super 8 interludes convey some of the textures of the films and there are some lovely photo-montages from all periods of his life. It was news to me that he considered both David Bowie and Terry Thomas for the part of Ariel! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thorough and engaging and makes an excellent introduction to Saint DerekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tom Charity/TIME OUT.\n\nBase Type:                          AVI(.AVI)                 \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:00:08                \nFrame Count:                                    90198             \nFrame Width x Height (pixels):                  640 x 480 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.333                     \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:                              25.000          \nPics Per Second:                                25.000            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1869                 \nMPEG-4:                                         MPEG-4                   \n[B-VOP][QPel][GMC][NVOP][H264]:                 [B-VOP][][][][]   \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.243&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7e6070e9ee1fa5e4b1da9607934df02a04913c1","amp;dn":"Derek+Jarman+-+Life+as+Art+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7e6070e9ee1fa5e4b1da9607934df02a04913c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,230,7,14,158,225,250,94,75,29,169,96,121,52,223,2,160,73,19,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
