The documentation, including what exact mods are included, whether meshes have been pyffi optimized, etc, is rather lacking.\n\n\n((Copy/pasted from 5.0 description!))\n\nThis is my very personal taste based modpack, you can like it or not, all mods added are intended mainly for immersion, realism and roleplaying, I do not want add content for content's sake mods like fancy body / location replacers / non-lore-friendly quests. I've even forced myself to do not keep much more than 100 Esps actived, so stability is assured.\n\nFCOM SuperPack includes a clean FCOM installation plus some mods you (well, I actually) cannot live without, and that are intended to do not break the FCOM game balance. The main difference with other modpacks is that this one is auto-installing, you won't even need to rebuild the bashed patch, just install and play!! Lot of esps have been cleaned, meshes have been pyffied (optimized), many compatibility fixes, even those not available on the Nexus but made by myself (SUPER Patch.esp), have been introduced, and overall everything is improved in the best way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d52d51b41816f9459a2183ef8a84383726d9093","amp;dn":"FCOM+Superpack+6.4.2.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d52d51b41816f9459a2183ef8a84383726d9093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,82,213,27,65,129,111,148,89,162,24,62,248,168,67,131,114,109,144,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
