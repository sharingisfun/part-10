He traces the path to war, making clear why Germany and Austria-Hungary were primarily to blame, and describes the gripping first clashes in the West, where the French army marched into action in uniforms of red and blue with flags flying and bands playing. In August, four days after the French suffered 27,000 men dead in a single day, the British fought an extraordinary holding action against oncoming Germans, one of the last of its kind in history. In October, at terrible cost the British held the allied line against massive German assaults in the first battle of Ypres. Hastings also re-creates the lesser-known battles on the Eastern Front, brutal struggles in Serbia, East Prussia and Galicia, where the Germans, Austrians, Russians and Serbs inflicted three million casualties upon one another by Christmas. \nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af1d8c194094364854292f7cb00d2e4a73f6044","amp;dn":"Catastrophe+Europe+Goes+to+War+1914+by+Max+Hastings.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af1d8c194094364854292f7cb00d2e4a73f6044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,241,216,193,148,9,67,100,133,66,146,247,203,0,210,228,167,63,96,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
