It acts as an anchor for roots, a purveyor of water and nutrients, a residence for a vast community of microorganisms and animals, a sanitizer of the environment, and a source of raw materials for construction and manufacturing. To develop lasting solutions to the challenges of balanced use and stewardship of the Earth, we require a fundamental understanding of soilÃ¢â‚¬â€from its elastic, porous three-phase system to its components, processes, and reactions.\nHandbook of Soil Sciences: Properties and Processes, Second Edition is the first of two volumes that form a comprehensive reference on the discipline of soil science. Completely revised and updated to reflect the current state of knowledge, this volume covers the traditional areas of soil science: soil physics, soil chemistry, soil mineralogy, soil biology and biochemistry, and pedology. Contributors discuss the application of physical principles to characterize the soil system and mass and energy transport processes within the critical zone. They present significant advances in soil chemistry; describe how minerals are formed and transformed; and provide an introduction to the soil biota. They also examine geomorphology, land use, hydropedology, and subaqueous soils as well as the classification and digital mapping of soil.\nCritical elements addressed in each section include:\nDescriptions of concepts and theories\nDefinitions, approaches, methodologies, and procedures\nData in tabular and figure format\nExtensive references\nThis cohesive handbook provides a thorough understanding of soil science principles and practices based on a rigorous, complete, and up-to-date treatment of the subject matter compiled by leading scientists. It is a resource rich in data, offering professional soil scientists, agronomists, engineers, ecologists, biologists, naturalists, and students their first point of entry into a particular aspect of the soil sciences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70674b2c53c57bc75ff009de480b1d9c22672abf","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Soil+Sciences%2C+Second+Edition+%28Two+Vdition+-+Pan+Min","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70674b2c53c57bc75ff009de480b1d9c22672abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,103,75,44,83,197,123,199,95,240,9,222,72,11,29,156,34,103,42,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
