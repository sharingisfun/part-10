The course introduces the latest hacking tools and techniques, and includes remote live labs for exercising the material presented to the students.\n\nThis course gives a solid understanding of the penetration testing process, and is equally important for those wanting to either defend or attack their network.\\&quot;\n\nWhat Is BackTrack?\n\nBackTrack is the result of the merging of two Innovative Penetration Testing live Linux distributions - Whax and Auditor. BackTrack has been dubbed as the best Security Live CD today, and has been rated 1st in its category, and 32nd overall in Insecure.org. Based on SLAX (Slackware), BackTrack provides user modularity. This means the distribution can be easily customised by the user to include personal scripts, additional tools, customised kernels, etc.\n\nThe courses are designed for busy professionals who need to step into the offensive security world, but do not have the time to attend a full blown course. Pre recorded sessions can be viewed in your own free time, at your leisure - and can be played over in case a topic needs further clarification.\n\nA student chatroom and forum allow you to interact with our trainers as well as other students and experience hacking tools and techniques in a real live computer lab. The lab is confined to a local network and is legally safe and sterile for exercise.\n\nUpon completion of the course, you may decide to take the Certification Challenge. In this final exam, your newly learned skills will be tested by a Hack Challenge in an unfamiliar environment. Once the challenge has been successfully completed, you will receive an OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) Certification.\n\nISC2 has accredited Offensive Security 101 v.2.0 with 40 ISC2 CPE Credits. This applies to students who submit their exercise documentation at the end of the course. \n\nCredits to : TheChiefPirate \n\nRAR Password : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;27574e55465342554e404f535467404a464e4b0944484a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c21692572f2f45b7181a1742aab8d03f9a34c4b","amp;dn":"Offensive+Security+101+-+Videos+%26+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c21692572f2f45b7181a1742aab8d03f9a34c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,33,105,37,114,242,244,91,113,129,161,116,42,171,141,3,249,163,76,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
