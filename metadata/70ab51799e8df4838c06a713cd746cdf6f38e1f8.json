Phonomancer David Kohl hadn't spared his old patron a thought for almost as long... at which point his mind starts to unravel. Can he discover what's happened to the Mod-Goddess of Britpop while there's still something of himself left? Dark modern-fantasy in a world where music is magic, where a song can save your life or end it.\n\nThe Singles Club:\n\nWe've put you on the guest list. Don't be late! This is one night you'll never forget! The second series of Phonogram separates itself from the frenzied mob of adoring critics just long enough to transform into this handsome collected volume, which features seven individual-yet-interconnected stories set in a single night in a single club, each starring a young phonomancer, and each exploring a different mystery of music and magic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70ab51799e8df4838c06a713cd746cdf6f38e1f8","amp;dn":"Phonogram+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70ab51799e8df4838c06a713cd746cdf6f38e1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,171,81,121,158,141,244,131,140,6,167,19,205,116,108,223,111,56,225,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
