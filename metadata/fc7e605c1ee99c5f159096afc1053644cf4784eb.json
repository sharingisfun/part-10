Heartbreaker\r\n\r\nBluecongo's Comments:\r\nI made this mix very &quot;wet &amp; nasty&quot;.  I really wanted to capture the energy\r\nof the crowd and the band reacting to it.  This new version I believe will \r\ncast a new light on the 1980 tour.  I did my best to include as much in \r\nbetween song banter as possible.  The Aud taper often paused his recorder \r\nin between songs to save tape apparently.  The warts of the Aud &amp; SB \r\nrecordings have been left in.  Drop outs, crackles, etc.  Kashmir switches \r\nfrom SB to Aud source midway through the song. \r\n\r\nComments: \r\nOne of the best shows from the 1980 tour, this show has a great version of \r\nHeartbreaker and The Train Kept a Rollin'. Jimmy flashes between inspired \r\nplaying and getting his fingers caught in the strings. The rest of the group \r\nplay well and seem to be having fun, although they totally botch Kashmir. \r\nThat caused Plant to commented it: &quot;If anybody's bootlegging that, you'll \r\nhave to scratch that number cause wasn't completely correct - somehow we got \r\nthrough it.&quot; Robert's voice is in great shape","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc7e605c1ee99c5f159096afc1053644cf4784eb","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1980.06.29+Zurich%2C+Switzerland+%28Matrix%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc7e605c1ee99c5f159096afc1053644cf4784eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,126,96,92,30,233,156,95,21,144,150,175,193,5,54,68,207,71,132,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
