Indeed, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite investors have long relied on alternative investments to produce their superior returns. Until now those options were the exclusive purview of institutions and the super wealthy, but today any informed investor can play the same game.\n\nA rainbow of investment options such as timber, startups, MLPs, hedged strategies, managed futures, infrastructure, cat bonds, peer-to-peer lending, farmland, and dozens of other non-traditional strategies can provide dramatically better gains, with less total risk, than the standard choices. In The Alternative Answer, Bob Rice, Bloomberg TVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alternative Investment Editor, leads an entertaining and easy-to-understand tour of this world, and suggests specific alternative investments for all four key Ã¢â‚¬Å“jobsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of a portfolio: safely generating more current income; decreasing risks of economic shocks; significantly increasing long-term profits; and protecting purchasing power over time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdbc2ac815dce1b01a7b0a28fdca0dee8bbf7062","amp;dn":"The+Alternative+Answer%3A+The+Nontraditional+Investments+That+Driv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdbc2ac815dce1b01a7b0a28fdca0dee8bbf7062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,188,42,200,21,220,225,176,26,123,10,40,253,202,13,238,139,191,112,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
