Her best-known work is The Joy Luck Club, which has been translated into 35 languages. In 1993, the book was adapted into a commercially successful film.\n\nTan has written several other bestselling novels, including The Kitchen God's Wife, The Hundred Secret Senses, The Bonesetter's Daughter and Saving Fish from Drowning. She also wrote a collection of non-fiction essays entitled The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings. In addition to these, Tan has written two children's books: The Moon Lady (1992) and Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat (1994), which was turned into an animated series which aired on PBS. She also appeared on PBS in a short spot encouraging children to write. Tan is also in a band with several other well-known writers, the Rock Bottom Remainders.\n\nTan was born in Oakland, California. She is the second of three children born to Chinese immigrants Daisy (nÃƒÂ©e Li), and John Tan, an electrical engineer and Baptist minister. When Tan was 15 years old, her older brother Peter and father both died of brain tumors within a year of each other. Daisy moved Amy and her younger brother John Jr. to Switzerland, where Amy finished high school. During this period in her life, Amy learned about her mother's former marriage to an abusive man in China, of their four children (a son who died as a toddler, and three daughters) and how her mother was forced to leave her children from a previous marriage behind in Shanghai. This incident provided the basis for Tan's first novel, 1989 New York Times bestseller The Joy Luck Club. In 1987 Amy traveled with Daisy to China. There, Amy met her three half-sisters.\n\nTan received her bachelor's and master's degrees in English and linguistics from San JosÃƒÂ© State University, and later did doctoral linguistics studies at UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley.\n\nIn a New York Times &quot;Room for Debate&quot; piece &quot;Deconstructing Lyme Disease&quot;, &quot;My Plight with the Illness&quot;, Amy Tan discussed her late-stage case.\n\nShe resides in Sausalito, California, with her husband, Louis DeMattei, a tax attorney whom she met on a blind date and married in 1974.\n\nTan was featured on The Simpsons episode &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot; on Season 12, Episode 3.\n\n\nThe torrent contains all the following books in ePUB format:\n\n\nNovels\n\n* The Joy Luck Club (1989)\n\n* The Kitchen God's Wife (1991)\n\n* The Hundred Secret Senses (1995)\n\n* The Bonesetter's Daughter (2000)\n\n* Saving Fish from Drowning (2005)\n\n* Rules for Virgins (2012)\n\n* The Valley of Amazement (2013)\n\n\nNon-fiction\n\n* The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings (2003)\n\n\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, check out the websites, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.harpercollins.com.au/author/authorExtra.aspx?authorID=50000456&amp;displayType=interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.harpercollins.com.au/author/authorExtra.aspx?authorID=50000456&amp;displayType=interview&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.amytan.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.amytan.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Tan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Tan&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/10/amy-tan-interview-valley-amazement&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/10/amy-tan-interview-valley-amazement&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10417111/Amy-Tan-a-life-thats-stranger-than-fiction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10417111/Amy-Tan-a-life-thats-stranger-than-fiction.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db199f213eb97cb73bf56749c4a03d5a610bf62","amp;dn":"Amy+Tan+-+Fictions+and+Non-Fiction+%288+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db199f213eb97cb73bf56749c4a03d5a610bf62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,177,153,242,19,235,151,203,115,191,86,116,156,74,3,213,166,16,191,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
