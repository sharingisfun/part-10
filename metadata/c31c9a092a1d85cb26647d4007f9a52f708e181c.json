More than a smooth-talker and someone she could trust. He had to overcome his reputation as a playboy, and his history with Harlow's half-sister, Nan, a woman with a reputation of her own.\n\nHarlow had taken the chance, falling hard and fast for the guy who thrilled her with his all-consuming desire. After a lifetime of avoiding bad boys like Grant, she had opened herself to the possibilities of love...\n\nBut a life-changing secret has torn them apart, and now Grant and Harlow must decide if they have enough fight to make it work - or if the pain of betrayal has permanently destroyed their future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c31c9a092a1d85cb26647d4007f9a52f708e181c","amp;dn":"Abbi+Glines-One+More+Chance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c31c9a092a1d85cb26647d4007f9a52f708e181c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,28,154,9,42,29,133,203,38,100,125,64,7,249,165,47,112,142,24,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
