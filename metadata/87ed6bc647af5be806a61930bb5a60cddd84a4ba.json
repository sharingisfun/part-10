IMDb does not list this 105 min. unrated Directors Cut version.]\n\nRated: R for partial nudity. (Nothing hardcore)\n\n  So bad it's good! &quot;Perils of Gwendoline&quot; boasts some of the worst acting in movie history, and some of the worst audio video synchronization since those cheap 1960's Kung Fu movies, but the constant parade of T&amp;A and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously guarantees that it will be seen and enjoyed long after thousands of &quot;better&quot; movies have faded into obscurity.\n  For bad-movie buffs everywhere, here is the shamelessly entertaining English-dubbed version of Just Jaekin's &quot;Gwendoline&quot; (&quot;The Perils of Gwendoline&quot;). Lavishly produced on a budget of less than $10 million, this tongue-in-cheek adventure plays like a campy parody of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, with sex kitten Tawny Kitaen making her dubious debut in the title role of Gwendoline (loosely based on John Willie's 1940's pioneering adult comic strip &quot;Sweet Gwendoline&quot;), a slim, sexy, and virginal adventuress on a globetrotting quest to find her missing father. The plot leads us to the mysterious land of an all-female slave culture known as the Yik Yak (where partial nudity can be found in abundance). Along the way, Gwendoline and her loopy friend Beth (played by French model/actress Zabou) recruit hunky mercenary Willard (Brent Huff) for a series of colorful misadventures including a chariot chase that must be seen to be believed.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\nGwendoline........Greece / West Germany\nAventuras de Gwendoline no ParaÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­so, As........Brazil\nGwendoline - vaarojen valtiatar........Finland\nGwendoline och jakten pÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥ Yik Yak........Sweden\nThe Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak....USA\n\n  Starring: Tawny Kitaen, Zabou Breitman, Brent Huff, Bernadette Lafont, Jean Rougerie.\n\n  Directed by: Just Jaeckin.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr.  45min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x  336\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87ed6bc647af5be806a61930bb5a60cddd84a4ba","amp;dn":"The+Perils+of+Gwendoline+%281985%29+%28Tawny+Kitaen%2C+Zabou+Breitman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87ed6bc647af5be806a61930bb5a60cddd84a4ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,237,107,198,71,175,91,232,6,166,25,48,187,90,96,205,221,132,164,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
