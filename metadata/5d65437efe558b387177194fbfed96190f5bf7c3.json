The Rashids are a powerful Arab family who pride themselves on financial success and an international reputation. So when they are sidestepped in critical oil-drilling negotiations, they swear an oath of vengeance against the one they hold responsible. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to operative Sean Dillion and a Washington colleague to keep the Rashids from their target--the President of the United States. Sweeping across the Middle East, Europe, and America, the RashidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ deadly plan escalates until the security of nations is at stake.
