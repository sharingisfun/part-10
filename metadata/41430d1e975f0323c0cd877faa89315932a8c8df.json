But it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t end there, and so the danger to men is all the greater. For in hotel rooms, trendy bookstores, television screens, and internet websites, there is enough viewing of pornographic materials to trap lives forever.\nIt is the world that author Henry Rogers reveals to us in a book that has too few peers. The Silent War, through interviews, statistics, and other facts, traces the unraveling of American men by the claws of pornography. Rogers, chaplain for Interstate Batteries, discusses his own battle with this terrible addiction, then builds concrete steps for helping others climb out of the pit.\nThe shame and devastation of porn addiction kills marriages every day, and this in-depth look at the problem sheds light on how to overcome this destructive obsession. Rogers tells his own story of addiction and how he overcame it, then gives practical help for others, and offers hope to thousands of people trapped in secret sin. Includes a chapter by a woman who suffered through the destruction of her own marriage, after her husband became addicted to pornography. The Silent War is a lifeline in a world in love with evil.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nHenry J. Rogers is the corporate chaplain for Interstate Batteries in Dallas, Texas.
