Hence an unfinished painting or sculpture often shows revealing features which are lost in the finished work. Antique statues are almost incomprehensible to us in their technique because the greatest effects are here achieved by the smallest means. The present text explains in a lucid and always interesting way how the Greek sculptors produced their works. The illustrations, mainly from unfinished sculptures, show the use of the different tools and make it clear how the artist proceeded from the first\ninspiration to the last stroke. This book gives a deeper insight into Greek art than many a bulky text-book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde97b380cabff6498933ac863187ec397a716ff","amp;dn":"Greek+sculptors+at+Work+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde97b380cabff6498933ac863187ec397a716ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,233,123,56,12,171,255,100,152,147,58,200,99,24,126,195,151,167,22,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
