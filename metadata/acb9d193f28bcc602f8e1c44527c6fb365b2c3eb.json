It is not a sequel to Quake; it merely uses the name of the former game due to id's difficulties in acquiring a trademark for alternative titles.[1] The soundtrack for Quake II was mainly provided by Sonic Mayhem, with some additional tracks by Bill Brown.&quot;\n\n\n\nThis is the Australian-Asian version of Quake 2.
