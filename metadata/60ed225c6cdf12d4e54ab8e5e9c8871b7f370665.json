Business cards are a major design challenge; creating successful cards is all about the clever use of space. Grouped according to aesthetic approach, the cards featured in the book address design issues such as the need to make a splash, stand out from the crowd or differentiate members of a team. Some cards are designed to function as portfolios or to express in miniature the holder's preferred aesthetic or personal worldview; some are elaborately designed, others are intended to be personalized with handwriting or stickers. Materials are also important: not all cards are machine printed, and the book includes cards on metal, plastic, paper and corrugated cardboard, or made from recycled stationery or subway tickets; text is applied using foil-blocking, spot varnish, letter press, colour Xerox and rubber stamping.\n\n\nPDF format / 272 pages in total\nLanguage - English\n\n\nPlease SEED\nLong Live Pirate Bay!\n\n\nPeace to all \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60ed225c6cdf12d4e54ab8e5e9c8871b7f370665","amp;dn":"Business+Cards+-The+Art+of+Saying+Hello","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60ed225c6cdf12d4e54ab8e5e9c8871b7f370665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,237,34,92,108,223,18,212,229,74,184,229,233,200,135,27,127,55,6,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
