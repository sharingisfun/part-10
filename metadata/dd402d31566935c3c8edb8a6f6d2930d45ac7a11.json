Hughes (1904Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1993) was a mystery author and literary critic. Born in Kansas City, she studied at Columbia University, and won an award from the Yale Series of Younger Poets for her first book, the poetry collection Dark Certainty (1931). After writing several unsuccessful manuscripts, she published The So Blue Marble in 1940. A New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased mystery, it won praise for its hardboiled prose, which was due, in part, to HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s editor, who demanded she cut 25,000 words from the book.\n\nHughes published thirteen more novels, the best known of which are In a Lonely Place (1947) and Ride the Pink Horse (1946). Both were made into successful films. In the early fifties, Hughes largely stopped writing fiction, preferring to focus on criticism, for which she would go on to win an Edgar Award. In 1978, the Mystery Writers of America presented Hughes with the Grand Master Award for literary achievement\n\nIn a Lonely Place\n&quot;Puts Chandler to shame . . . Hughes is the master we keep turning to.&quot; -- Sara Paretsky, author of the V. I. Warshawski novels. &quot;A superb novel by one of crime fiction's finest writers of psychological suspense. . . . What a pleasure it is to see this tale in print once again!&quot; -- Marcia Miller, author of the Sharon McCone novels. &quot;This lady is the queen of noir, and In a Lonely Place is her crown.&quot; -- Laurie R. King, author of the Mary Russell novels. Postwar Los Angeles is a lonely place where the American Dream is showing its seamy underside -- and a stranger is preying on young women. The suggestively names Dix Steele, a cynical vet with a chip on his shoulder about the opposite sex, is the LAPD's top suspect. Dix knows enough to watch his step, especially since his best friend is on the force, but when he meets the luscious Laurel Gray -- a femme fatale with brains -- something begins to crack. The basis for extraordinary performances by Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame in the 1950 film version of the book, In a Lonely Place tightens the suspence with taut, hard-boiled prose and stunningly undoes the convential noir plot.\n\nThe Bamboo Blonde: Beautiful But Dead\nWhen Con Satterlee picked up the half-intoxicated blonde in the Bamboo Bar, Griselda was annoyed. When he- walked out with the blonde, leaving Griselda flat, she was furious. She was frightened, too, returning alone to the isolated, ramshackle beach cottage. And this was to have been their second honeymoon!\nCon came back rattling a handful of shells which he said he had taken from the blonde's revolver. But the blonde didn't come back. The police found her corpse the next morning. And then Con was arrested. That left Griselda alone, behind a door with a lock that a bent hairpin could open. Quite defenseless, she had to face the sinister Major Pembrooke, who wanted something from Con; beautiful, lying Kathie; Dare, so very possessive as far as Con was concerned; and the debonair Kew, who was intent on helping Griselda, for selfish reasons.\n\nThe Blackbirder: A classic World War II-era noir with a page-turning plot, a cast of colorfully sinister characters and a protagonist who is thrust into the heart of political intrigue, this captivating 1943 novel parallels the spy novels of Grahame Greene, Eric Ambler, and the films of Hitchcock and Lang. But in -signature Hughes fashion, The Blackbirder has a genre-bending twist: its hardboiled protagonist is a woman.\nBorn of American expatriate parents, Julie Guilles was a pretty, sheltered rich girl growing up in Paris, a favorite of the &quot;Ritz Bar&quot; set. But everything changed when the Nazis rolled into the City of Lights. After three years of life underground, Julie is hiding out in New York; but she knows trouble is coming when the corpse of an acquaintance appears on her doorstep. With a host of possible dangers on her tail-the Gestapo, the FBI and the New York cops-she embarks on a desperate journey to Santa Fe in search of her last, best hope. &quot;The Blackbirder&quot;is a legend among refugees, a trafficker in human souls who flies under the radar to bring people to safety across the Mexican border-for a price.\nWith no resources at her disposal but a smuggled diamond necklace and her own razor-sharp wits, Julie must navigate a tangle of dangers-and take a stand in the worldwide struggle that has shattered the lives of millions. In contrast to the typical representations of wartime women as &quot;Mrs. Minivers&quot; guarding home and hearth, Dorothy B. Hughes gives her intrepid heroine a place at the heart of the action.\n\nRide the Pink Horse\nIn Ride the Pink Horse, during Fiesta, three desperate men converge in a perilous New Mexico town. It takes four days for Sailor to travel to New Mexico by bus. He arrives broke, sweaty, and ready to get whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the annual Fiesta, and the locals burn an effigy of Zozobra so that their troubles follow the mythical character into the fire. But for former senator Willis Douglass, trouble is just beginning. Sailor was WillisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal secretary when his wife died in an apparent robbery-gone-wrong. Only Sailor knows it was Willis who ordered her murder, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agreed to keep his mouth shut in exchange for a little bit of cash. On SailorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tail is a cop who wants the senator for more than a payoff. As Fiesta rages on, these three men will circle one another in a dance of death, as they chase truth, money, and revenge.\n\nThe Scarlet Imperial\nA fashionable young woman with a taste for adventurous men, she made the mistake of falling in love with Towner ClayÃ¢â‚¬â€a New York City playboy whose international jetsetting conceals dangerous secrets. On TownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behalf, she has spent six months pretending to be Eliza Williams, a dowdy Midtown secretary. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dull work until the day Gavin Keane, a blue-eyed associate of TownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, leaves her with a mysterious package. Eliza understands that protecting it is a question of life and death. When he comes to pick up the package that night, Gavin is followed, and he shoots the man to protect the parcelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret. With blood on her carpet and a mystery on her hands, the woman who is not Eliza will have to act quickly to survive.\n\nThe So Blue Marble\nThe so blue marble. It promised treasure, but now it's missing. The result is murder. The dashing twin brothers want the marble, or else... they'll do to Griselda what they've done to others. But Griselda doesn't have it. And why is her baby sister hanging out with the psychotic twins? \n\nDavidian Report\nWhen bad weather forces his flight to Los Angeles to land outside of town, Steve Wintress agrees to share a car with three of his fellow travelers: a timid young soldier, a powerful Justice Department official, and a taciturn Hollywood beauty. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know it yet, but all four strangers have something in commonÃ¢â‚¬â€and one of them might kill to get it.\nA Communist defector has smuggled the priceless Davidian report out of East Berlin, and every secret agency in the world wants to get its hands on it. The report is somewhere in Los Angeles, and Steve will have to battle the CIA, FBI, and the Communist Party to secure it for himself. As he knows all too well, in a game like this, the last thing you should trust is a friendly face.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd402d31566935c3c8edb8a6f6d2930d45ac7a11","amp;dn":"Dorothy+B.+Hughes+Novels+%28Crime%2C+Noir%2C+Mystery%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd402d31566935c3c8edb8a6f6d2930d45ac7a11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,64,45,49,86,105,53,195,200,237,184,166,246,210,147,13,69,172,122,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
