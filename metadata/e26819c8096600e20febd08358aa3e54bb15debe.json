Radhakrishna Rao, M. Bhaskara Rao;\nWorld Scientific Pub Co Inc; 1st edition (September 15, 1998).\n\nWritten by two top statisticians with experience in teaching matrix methods for applications in statistics, econometrics and related areas, this book provides a comprehensive treatment of the latest techniques in matrix algebra. A well balanced approach to discussing the mathematical theory and applications to problems in other areas is an attractive feature of the book. It can be used as a textbook in courses on matrix algebra for statisticians, econometricians and mathematicians as well. Some of the new developments of linear models are give in some detail using results of matrix algebra.\n\nContents:\n========\n 1 Vector Spaces\n 2 Unitary and Euclidean Spaces\n 3 Linear Transformation and Matrices\n 4 Characteristics of Matrices\n 5 Factorization of Matrices\n 6 Operations on Matrices\n 7 Projectors and Idempotent Operators\n 8 Generalized Inverses\n 9 Majorization\n10 Inequalities for Eigenvalues\n11 Matrix Approximations\n12 Optimization problems in statistics and econometrics\n13 Quadratic Subspaces\n14 Inequalities with Applications in Statistics\n15 Non-negative matrices\n16 Miscellaneous complements\n   References\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Matrix-Algebra-Applications-Statistics-Econometrics/dp/9810232683&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Matrix-Algebra-Applications-Statistics-Econometrics/dp/9810232683&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e26819c8096600e20febd08358aa3e54bb15debe","amp;dn":"Matrix+Algebra+and+Its+Applications+to+Statistics+and+Econometri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e26819c8096600e20febd08358aa3e54bb15debe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,104,25,200,9,102,0,226,15,235,208,131,88,170,62,84,187,21,222,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
