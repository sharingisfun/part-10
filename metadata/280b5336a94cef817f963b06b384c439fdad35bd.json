During his voyage on the big German windjammer, Johnson compiled unequaled footage of the crew's daily activities, and spectacular images of a wild storm as the ship made the dangerous passage around. Johnson's narration of the trip is a delight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:280b5336a94cef817f963b06b384c439fdad35bd","amp;dn":"Around+Cape+Horn+%281929%29+%5BDVD5+ISO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"280b5336a94cef817f963b06b384c439fdad35bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,11,83,54,169,76,239,129,127,150,59,6,179,132,196,57,253,173,53,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
