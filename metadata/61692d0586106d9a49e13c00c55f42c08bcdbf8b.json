The files are .avi and are reasonable sound and picture quality considering they were saved from VHS recordings from the telly. You must expect a little bit of warbling on the sound and some fuzzy lines and video glitches, but nothing that spoils the enjoyment of the show!\n\nI will follow this up with series 6,7 and 8, but as I only have a slow Broadband connection, it will probably take a week or so before I can stop seeding this one and get on with the next ones, so I&amp;#039;m relying one someone seeding this after I have completed at least one upload. Please help, this doesn&amp;#039;t deserve to stay in obscurity!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61692d0586106d9a49e13c00c55f42c08bcdbf8b","amp;dn":"Onedin+Line+Season+5+at+last%21+ripped+from+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61692d0586106d9a49e13c00c55f42c08bcdbf8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,105,45,5,134,16,109,154,73,225,60,0,197,95,66,192,139,205,191,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
