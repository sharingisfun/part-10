HER FRIENDS HAVE TURNED. After her identity is revealed during the Inundation, Princess Wilhelmina is kept prisoner by the Indigo Kingdom, with the Ospreys lost somewhere in the devastated city. When the Ospreysâ€™ leader emerges at the worst possible moment, leaving Wilâ€™s biggest ally on his deathbed, she must become Black Knife to set things right. HER MAGIC IS UNCONTROLLABLE. Wilâ€™s power is to animate, not to give true life, but in the wraithland she commanded a cloud of wraith mist to save herself, and later ordered it solid. Now there is a living boy made of wraithâ€”destructive and deadly, and willing to do anything for her. HER HEART IS TORN. Though sheâ€™s ready for her crown, declaring herself queen means war. Caught between what she wants and what is right, Wilhelmina realizes the throne might not even matter. Everyone thought the wraith was years off, but already itâ€™s destroying Indigo Kingdom villages. If she canâ€™t protect both kingdoms, soon there wonâ€™t be a land to rule","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3376f8dc74394cb2ac7ad32decc6e42854d5d04d","amp;dn":"The+Mirror+King+by+Jodi+Meadows+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3376f8dc74394cb2ac7ad32decc6e42854d5d04d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,118,248,220,116,57,76,178,172,122,211,45,236,198,228,40,84,213,208,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
