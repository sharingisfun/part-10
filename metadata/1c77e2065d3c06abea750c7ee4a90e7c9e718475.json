All of the known bootleg sources of Woodstock as of 2004. We're working on the new version, but this'll hold you till then. We included Hendrix, even though its officially released, as the official version is missing two songs plus it was edited so much that other parts are missing.\n\nThe idea is to get this and then buy the official sources and put your own version of Woodstock Complete together. There's a file included which tells you what cds to buy.\n\nThere are TWO versions of the artwork here - one for this Complete Bootleg Woodstock and one for Woodstock Complete (the one you put together at home from official + bootleg sources).\n\nThis *will* take a few days to seed. Be patient. Why didn't I seed it in parts? It wouldn't be worth it to have 4 parts and only 2 or 3 of them available months from now. A year ago, I seeded the bootleg Live Aid (the stuff not on the official dvd) and almost a year later, its still on The Pirate Bay!\n\nPass this onto your friends. When I see people write, &quot;don't encode to mp3&quot;, on other torrents, I laugh to myself -- its none of my business what you convert this to once you have it. All file extensions were created equal. I prefer wav/flac/shn/lossless, but its not an ideology, its a hobby!!\n\nHere's the setlist:\n\n------- \nDISC ONE:\n-------  \n\nRichie Havens:\n1.
