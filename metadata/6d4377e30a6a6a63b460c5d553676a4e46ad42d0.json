This set includes:\nDVD shrink - Lets you keep .iso format but shrink an image by video compression or by removing things like audio tracks or menus (if one menu then all)\nDVD Decrypter - On the rare occasion protection is in place that won't be read by DVD Shrink this program can usually get around it.  Also good for burning ANY .iso (that I have tried..including xbox) file to a dvd+/-r (won't create a .iso though if it isn't from a DVD).\nRipit4me - works with DVD Decrypter to crack discs that have the newer form of protection (bad title lists or corrupted sectors that aren't supposed to be read, passes on a list to DVD Decrypter to let it skip these parts, then cleans up the files afterward).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4377e30a6a6a63b460c5d553676a4e46ad42d0","amp;dn":"Dvd+Decrypter+3.5.4.0+-+DVD+Shrink+3.2.0.15+-+Ripit4me+1.7.1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4377e30a6a6a63b460c5d553676a4e46ad42d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,67,119,227,10,106,106,99,180,96,197,213,83,103,106,78,70,173,66,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
