The Contest, which has been broadcast every year since its debut in 1956, is one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. The Contest's winner has been determined using numerous voting techniques throughout its history; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or televoters. The country awarded the most points is declared the winner.[1] The first Eurovision Song Contest was not won on points, but by votes (two per country), and only the winner was announced.[2]\n\nThere have been 54 Contests, with one winner each year except the tied 1969 Contest, which had four. Twenty-five different countries have won the contest. Switzerland won the Contest on their debutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the first Contest, in 1956. The country with the highest number of wins is Ireland, with seven. Portugal is the country with the longest history in the Contest without a win; it made its forty-second appearance at the 2009 Contest. The only person to have won more than once as performer is Ireland's Johnny Logan, who performed &quot;What's Another Year&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; in 1987. Logan is also one of only five songwriters to have written more than one winning entry (&quot;Hold Me Now&quot; 1987 and &quot;Why Me?&quot; 1992, performed by Linda Martin).[3] This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his/her credit, as either singer, songwriter or both.\n\nWinning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a unique opportunity for the winning artist(s) to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by launching or furthering their international career. However, throughout the history of the Contest relatively few names have gone on to be huge international stars. The most notable winning Eurovision artists whose career was directly launched into the spotlight following their win were ABBA, who won the Contest for Sweden in 1974 with their song &quot;Waterloo&quot;. ABBA went on to be one of the most successful bands of their time.[4] Another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame and success was CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line Dion, who won the Contest for Switzerland in 1988 with the song &quot;Ne partez pas sans moi&quot;, though her international singing career came some years later and is not generally directly associated to her winning the contest.[5]\n\n1956 - Switzerland - Refrain                                \n1957 - Netherlands - Net Als Toen                           \n1958 - France - Dors Mon Amour                              \n1959 - Netherlands - Een Beetje                             \n1960 - France - Tom Pillibi                                 \n1961 - Luxembourg - Nous Les Amoureux                       \n1962 - France - Un Premier Amour                            \n1963 - Denmark - Dansevise                                  \n1964 - Italy - Non Ho LEta                                  \n1965 - Luxembourg - Poupee De Cire, Poupee De Son           \n1966 - Austria - Merci, Cherie                              \n1967 - United Kingdom - Puppet On A String                  \n1968 - Spain - La, La, La                                   \n1969 - France - Un Jour, Un Enfant                          \n1969 - Netherlands - De Troubadour                          \n1969 - Spain - Vivo Cantando                                \n1969 - United Kingdom - Boom Bang-a-bang                    \n1970 - Ireland - All Kinds Of Everything                    \n1971 - Monaco - Un Banc Un Arbre Une Rue                    \n1972 - Luxembourg - Apres Toi                               \n1973 - Luxembourg - Tu Te Reconnaitras                      \n1974 - Sweden - Waterloo                                    \n1975 - Netherlands - Ding-a-dong                            \n1976 - United Kingdom - Save Your Kisses For Me             \n1977 - France - L oiseau Et L enfant                        \n1978 - Israel - A-Ba-Ni-Bi                                  \n1979 - Israel - Hallelujah                                  \n1980 - Ireland - What's Another Year                        \n1981 - United Kingdom - Making Your Mind Up                 \n1982 - Germany - Ein Bisschen Frieden                       \n1983 - Luxembourg - Si La Vie Est Cadeau                    \n1984 - Sweden - Diggi-loo Diggi-ley                         \n1985 - Norway - La Det Swinge                               \n1986 - Belgium - J aime La Vie                              \n1987 - Ireland - Hold Me Now                                \n1988 - Switzerland - Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi                 \n1989 - Yugoslavia - Rock Me                                 \n1990 - Italy - Insieme 1992                                 \n1991 - Sweden - Fangad Av En Stormvind                      \n1992 - Ireland - Why Me                                     \n1993 - Ireland - In Your Eyes                               \n1994 - Ireland - Rock n Roll Kids                           \n1995 - Norway - Nocturne                                    \n1996 - Ireland - The Voice                                  \n1997 - United Kingdom - Love Shine A Light                  \n1998 - Israel - Diva                                        \n1999 - Sweden - Take Me To Your Heaven                      \n2000 - Denmark - Fly On The Wings Of Love                   \n2001 - Estonia - Everybody                                  \n2002 - Latvia - I Wanna                                     \n2003 - Turkey - Every Way That I Can                        \n2004 - Ukraine - Wild Dances                                \n2005 - Greece - My Number One                               \n2006 - Finland - Hard Rock Hallelujah                       \n2007 - Serbia - Molitva                                     \n2008 - Russia - Believe                                     \n2009 - Norway - Fairytale                                   \n\n\nEleven Eurovision winners (alongside three non-winners) featured at the Congratulations concert in 2005, in which ABBA's &quot;Waterloo&quot; was voted the most popular song of the Contest's first fifty years.[7] The most successful country never to have won the Contest is Malta, having finished second and third twice. The lowest total is the eighteen points scored by the four winning countries in 1969. The largest margin of victory was that of Alexander Rybak in 2009, who won by 169 points. Rybak won 387 points, a record score, winning twelve points from sixteen out of 41 countries (excluding themselves).\n\nThe United Kingdom has finished second fifteen times at Eurovision, more than any other country. Ireland has finished first seven times, more than any other country, Ireland also won the contest for three consecutive years (1992, 1993,1994), more consecutive years than any other country. Since the introduction of the current voting system in 1975, the winner of the Contest has been decided by the final voting nation on ten occasions.[N 6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6bb9f8a81bf6d71b1672a109baf478359aa0bd3","amp;dn":"Eurovision+Best+Song+Winners+1956-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6bb9f8a81bf6d71b1672a109baf478359aa0bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,187,159,138,129,191,109,113,177,103,42,16,155,175,71,131,89,170,11,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
