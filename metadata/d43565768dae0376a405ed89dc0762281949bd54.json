Readers will master both the C++ language and Qt libraries, as they learn to develop maintainable software with well-defined code layers and simple, reusable classes and functions.\n\nEvery chapter of this edition has been improved with new content, better organization, or both. Readers will find extensively revised coverage of QObjects, Reflection, Widgets, Main Windows, Models and Views, Databases, Multi-Threaded Programming, and Reflection. This edition introduces the powerful new Qt Creator IDE; presents new multimedia APIs; and offers extended coverage of Qt Designer and C++ Integration. It has been restructured to help readers start writing software immediately and write robust, effective software sooner.\n\nThe authors introduce several new design patterns, add many quiz questions and labs, and present more efficient solutions relying on new Qt features and best practices. They also provide an up-to-date C++ reference section and a complete application case study.\n\nMaster C++ keywords, literals, identifiers, declarations, types, and type conversions.\nUnderstand classes and objects, organize them, and describe their interrelationships.\nLearn consistent programming style and naming rules.\nUse lists, functions, and other essential techniques.\nDefine inheritance relationships to share code and promote reuse.\nLearn how code libraries are designed, built, and reused.\nWork with QObject, the base class underlying much of Qt.\nBuild graphical user interfaces with Qt widgets.\nUse templates to write generic functions and classes.\nMaster advanced reflective programming techniques.\nUse the Model-View framework to cleanly separate data and GUI classes.\nValidate input using regular expressions and other techniques.\nParse XML data with SAX, DOM, and QXmlStreamReader.\nMaster todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most valuable creational and structural design patterns.\nCreate, use, monitor, and debug processes and threads.\nAccess databases with QtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SQL classes.\nManage memory reliably and efficiently.\nUnderstand how to effectively manage QThreads and use QtConcurrent algorithms.\nBook Details\nHardcover: 768 pages\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 2nd Edition (September 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0132826453\nISBN-13: 978-0132826457","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43565768dae0376a405ed89dc0762281949bd54","amp;dn":"Prentice.Hall.Introduction.to.Design.Patterns.in.CPP.with.Qt.2nd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d43565768dae0376a405ed89dc0762281949bd54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,53,101,118,141,174,3,118,164,5,237,137,220,7,98,40,25,73,189,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
