The newly resurrected, but no less rebellious, Lestat addresses a mysterious twenty-first century vampire genocide with the same panache, self-absorption, and drama readers have come to know and love. Rice masterfully populates the present-day storyline with a cast of characters from her previous novels along with new blood, so to speak, and reading this book is like seeing old friends whom youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d sort of forgotten about, but are thrilled to meet againÃ¢â‚¬â€even if you are reading about them for the first time. Prince Lestat raises interesting questions about the boundaries of science, conflicting beliefs, and a universal need to belong; a welcome return to a narrative that spawned an entire subgenre of fiction. --Seira Wilson\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Rice] retakes her throne as Queen of the Damned . . . visceral and gritty . . . [Prince Lestat] infuses new life into the Vampire Chronicles and sets the stage for a new era.\n\n-Elise de los Santos, Chicago RedEye\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“No one does what Anne Rice does . . . Not only does she find waysÃ¢â‚¬â€brilliant waysÃ¢â‚¬â€to tease new narrative potential from old stories, she does so while acknowledging that those stories are already part of the other charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ psyches. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know of any other novelist doing that . . . she has not lost any of her flair for description, allowing us to experience the world the way her vampires do, with the sensory volume turned up to 11 . . . fun, sexy, and irresistible.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-January Magazine\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Irrepressively seductive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-John Russell, Next Magazine\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Bloody marvelous . . . Prince Lestat is saving the undead from banality and overfamiliarity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-Daniel DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Addario, Time\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Chilling.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-Us Magazine\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Anne Rice reminds us just how immense and rich with history her universe of poetic, morally questioning vampires is, and Prince Lestat serves as a palate cleanser to the hormone-soaked teen dramas of the past few years. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice to have a real grown-up back in the game.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-Cotton Codinha, Elle\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ambitious...Rice never lost touch with the exuberant, often witty, and always fearless voice of irrepressible vampire Lestat de Lioncourt... Rice has offered us a tale of tremendous ambition, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absolutely delivered.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-Matthew Jackson, BookPage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2631e1138005afd3cb4d10f46df0b662b9a14a5","amp;dn":"Prince+Lestat+-+Anne+Rice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2631e1138005afd3cb4d10f46df0b662b9a14a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,99,30,17,56,0,90,253,60,180,209,15,70,223,11,102,43,154,20,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
