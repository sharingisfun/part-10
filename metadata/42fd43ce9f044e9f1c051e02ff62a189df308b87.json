Enter the League of Incredible Vegetables! Friends Bob the Tomato (Thingamabob), Petunia Rhubarb (Vogue), Mr. Lunt (S-Cape), and Junior Asparagus (Ricochet) all reveal their superhero personas to LarryBoy as the group teams up to take on Dr. Flurry, a mad scientist who is determined to freeze all of Bumblyburg in fear.
