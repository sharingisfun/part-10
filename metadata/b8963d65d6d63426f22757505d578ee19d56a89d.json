It is sure to stir debate and capture headlines around the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8963d65d6d63426f22757505d578ee19d56a89d","amp;dn":"George+Friedman+-+America%5C%27s+Secret+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8963d65d6d63426f22757505d578ee19d56a89d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,150,61,101,214,214,52,38,242,39,87,80,93,87,142,225,157,86,168,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
