Neurologic Differential Diagnosis is the answer. Unlike other texts which are divided into disease entities, this book uses a case study approach to focus on the patients' symptoms. Each chapter is dedicated to a specific presenting symptom or sign and includes a comprehensive, yet succinct table of clinical features to aid clarification of the broad list of diagnostic possibilities. This allows the clinician to quickly reference specific symptoms such as dizziness, mental status change or diplopia; or signs such as foot drop or psychotic behavior, and then immediately generate diagnostic possibilities. Written from the authors' extensive clinical experience, Neurologic Differential Diagnosis is an invaluable text for neurologists and psychiatrists at all stages of training.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aef62031d89e2b858ebbf0a7f6ad4e534170477","amp;dn":"Neurologic+Differential+Diagnosis+%28Cambridge%29+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aef62031d89e2b858ebbf0a7f6ad4e534170477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,239,98,3,29,137,226,184,88,235,191,10,127,106,212,229,52,23,4,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
