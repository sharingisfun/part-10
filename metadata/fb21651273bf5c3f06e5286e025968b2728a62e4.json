Any of the four decks in TRAKTOR PRO 2.5 can be switched to be a Remix Deck.\n\nEach Remix Deck offers four different Slots (columns), ideal for arranging sounds and loops by instrument groups e.g. different drum, bass, percussion loops. Play one sound per column - a total of four samples at any one time. Use loops from the included sound content or import any loops and sounds of your own. Develop your own unique trademark sound and build a personal arsenal of sounds by live-capturing your favorite loops while DJing.\n\n\nRegistered users of TRAKTOR PRO 2 can access a wealth of top quality loops and one-shots for use with the Remix Decks. Renowned artists have provided inspiring material in a number of genres, including Remix Sets prepared by Pan-Pot, Stewart Walker, and Marc Houle, among others.\n\nIn all 1.4 GB of content is available Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and all for free!
