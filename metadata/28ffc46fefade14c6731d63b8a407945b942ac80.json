Peter is delighted with how many artists signed up for the project and bearing in mind the calibre and careers of those artists whose songs he selected, it's rather incredible that all but two songwriters were able to reciprocate. (For those uncompleted swaps, Joseph Arthur and Feist willingly entered the fray with their respective versions of Shock The Monkey and Don't Give Up). The reciprocating artists opted for differing approaches to Peter's songs. A few chose to radically reinterpret the original material, in the process leaving it barely recognisable - Lou Reed's snarling Solsbury Hill or the frighteningly futuristic version of Mother Of Violence by Brian Eno, co-writer of David Bowie's Heroes covered by Gabriel on 'Scratch My Back'. Other contributors include Arcade Fire (Games Without Frontiers), Elbow (Mercy Street) and Regina Spektor (Blood Of Eden).\n\n\nTracklist:\n----------------\n01 - I Don't Remember (with David Byrne) (3:38)\n02 - Come Talk to Me (with Bon Iver) (6:20)\n03 - Blood of Eden (with Regina Spektor) (4:39)\n04 - Not One of Us (with Stephin Merritt) (3:49)\n05 - Shock the Monkey (with Joseph Arthur) (5:49)\n06 - Big Time (with Randy Newman) (3:29)\n07 - Games without Frontiers (with Arcade Fire) (3:22)\n08 - Mercy Street (with Elbow) (5:28)\n09 - Mother of Violence (with Brian Eno) (3:00)\n10 - Don't Give Up (with Feist feat.
